<p>Back when I was a chubby, weird, nerdy kid who was very worried that I’d always and forever be that gigantic, that awkward, and that trapped in my own weirdness, I used to think “Well, Peter Parker used to be this nerd who everyone picked on and no one understood, then he became this cool hero with a fun job who married this beautiful model who loved him.” And then I’d think, “It won’t be this bad forever.”</p>
<p>This picture reminded me of that. Haven’t thought about that kid in a long time.</p>

<p>If “The Amazing Spider-Man 2” was actually just a slideshow of Andrew Garfield in his Spider-Man costume talking to and playing basketball with kids, I’d be fine with that.</p>
<p>And in so many ways it would actually speak much more to what Spider-Man really is than anything they could ever capture in a script.</p>
