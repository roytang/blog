<blockquote><p>007 License to Kill Target Creature<br/><br/>I hope I haven’t done the rules a total injustice! I THINK this is the basic rules right? They are so much more nuanced and complex than this, BUT hey, I think it might be enough to loosely follow.</p><p>I had a rad time at the Friday Night Magic draft at chezgeeks last friday. I’ll try do a lil mini recap of it! WOO!</p></blockquote>
