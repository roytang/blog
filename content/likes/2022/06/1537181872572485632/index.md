Okay, the day has finally come.



I am forced to grudgingly admit that I have found a blockchain game that legitimately does something with Blockchain that is genuinely new, innovative, and that you can't do with a centralized service.



That game is Dark Forest.

<time id="1537182096435089408">[05:15]</time> Now, the money side of crypto seems *completely* uninterested in this game for the most part, which is pretty telling.



This is basically a weird tech demo made by some MIT students. I have no idea if it has the potential to be like, actually popular, but it's interesting.

<time id="1537182317072236544">[05:16]</time> The base game is basically just GalCon with fog of war, on a blockchain.



Now, I know what you're thinking, big deal, we can do that with a centralized service! And you'd be right. There's a few things they accomplish stuffing this whole thing on-chain, however:

<time id="1537182745339625472">[05:18]</time> (First of all, this isn't on Ethereum but a proof-of-stake Ethereum fork, Gnosis chain, so that's table stakes for me. Get that PoW out of here.)



The big idea is "zk snarks", which are a way to cryptographically demonstrate you made a valid move, without revealing it

<time id="1537182944170627073">[05:19]</time> Again, that in and of itself is not something we couldn't do on a centralized service.



But, it's what enables you to make a non-total-information game run fully on chain. That's important, it was an unsolved problem before zk-snarks

<time id="1537183122164715520">[05:19]</time> There's various flavors of zero knowledge stuff, but point is you couldn't even play rock paper scissors on chain without it, because you'd reveal your move to your opponent.

<time id="1537183277198774272">[05:20]</time> The REAL innovation of Dark Forest is this concept they have about "digital physics."



Now... whether you think this is a GOOD thing depends on your perspective. But it's genuinely innovative.

<time id="1537183528840237056">[05:21]</time> The whole concept of digital physics is that you have some layer of smart contracts that basically define a basic API. In DF it's all, there's planets, you can conquer them, you can make more ships, you can try to discover new planets, etc etc

<time id="1537183810680684544">[05:22]</time> The catch with "digital physics" is that ANYONE can deploy new contracts that can interact with the existing primitives and... it's instantly deployed to all players, and nobody can opt out, and the devs themselves can't stop the game (if they burned their upgrade keys at least)

<time id="1537183962287980544">[05:23]</time> Would you be surprised at this point to hear that the developers were highly inspired by EVE online?

<time id="1537184116436660224">[05:23]</time> The point with "digital physics" is that any interaction that is implicitly allowed by the base layer of gameplay IS NECESSARILY PERMITTED.



Example:



I have a maze game. You can move in it. Players can't be in the same place at the same time. Also there's treasure to find.

<time id="1537184378920398849">[05:24]</time> Well, I could write a contract that spawns a skeleton "player" that chases you and tries to corner you. It can't enforce a gameover, or steal your stuff, but it can exploit the "no two players in the same place" to corner you and send a message demanding your treasure.

<time id="1537184605790519296">[05:25]</time> Is this good? Well, if you're in to that sort of thing.



This is a very wild west area of game design in all the senses of the word. It's very weird and very indirect and hard to predict. 



Also pretty hard to scale because blockchain is so dang slow

<time id="1537184864017035265">[05:26]</time> So, true to my word, I'm grudgingly admitting:



1) that somebody has found a way to stuff an entire game onto a blockchain without sneaking in a centralized service



2) it does something genuinely new and interesting



Whether its revolutionary or not remains to be seen

<time id="1537185048968962049">[05:27]</time> Also:



3) It doesn't have a whiff of scamming because there's like zero money at stake (transactions cost pennies of the utility token)



4) It isn't burning up the environment.

<time id="1537185420391464961">[05:28]</time> So congrats, I found the least worst blockchain game! Lars seal of non disapproval!



Snark aside, genuinely congrats to these MIT nerds for doing some groundbreaking research.

<time id="1537187568189689861">[05:37]</time> Geez this is doing numbers. I don't have a soundcloud, but here's my piece on why digital real estate is really stupid and how it speedruns a digital housing crisis similar to the real world one. (Land Value Tax would fix this)
