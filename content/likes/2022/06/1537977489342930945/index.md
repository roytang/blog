Contrary to popular belief, most DLC isn’t content that was maliciously cut from the game to make an extra buck. 



DLC has its own budget, timelines, greenlight, staff, etc. It’s a whoooole separate project. And nowadays it’s necessary for a AAA/AAAA game to ever break even.

Game devs, what's something that you wish the general public knew about making games?

[@koopattack](https://twitter.com/koopattack/) [@PushDustIn](https://twitter.com/PushDustIn/) Yup, quad-A is a real term. Usually in reference to games with planet-size budgets (roughly 100M+). Your Fortnites, Destinys, Halos, etc. 



A $50M game and a $150M game both seem big, but they’re completely different scales, so the language (AAA vs AAAA) is useful.

[@Barbiergaming](https://twitter.com/Barbiergaming/) Good question! Publishers (and devs) DO reduce scope to conttol scope. Heck, 95% of game development is just managing scope. 

That said, scope is complicated — some things just can’t be reduced/compressed/cut.

[@Feniks_Gaming](https://twitter.com/Feniks_Gaming/) [@hypecaster](https://twitter.com/hypecaster/) A game studio’s financials are less like Uncle Scrooge’s money bin &amp; more like individual checking accounts at a bank.

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/MushrooQueendom/status/1538350689276948482/" label="MushrooQueendom's tweet" %}}

Many game studios (often publishers) have a “greenlight” process to assess if a project is financially viable &amp; a market fit. If stakeholders say so, the game is greenlit, funded, &amp; staffed for production.

AAA/A serve a different audience/scratch a diff itch than indies. It’s like the difference bt a BIG summer blockbuster &amp; an arthouse film. There’s A LOT that needs to change in gamedev, but the solution isn’t no AAA/A, bc ppl really do enjoy those experiences.

This is a waaay too common misconception, but 1) it doesn’t make sense to intentionally release unfinished/incomplete games — no one wants this, 2) this is not even how game systems are built — that would make the tech exponentially more complex, 3) break-evens are 100% a thing. https://twitter.com/drewedbabe/status/1538414336799961088

[@Skanarchist8](https://twitter.com/Skanarchist8/) The vast majority of a AAA/A game’s budget goes to 2 things, both unavoidable: tech &amp; payroll.

Celebs &amp; focus tests are &lt;&lt; 1% of my budget &amp; marketing is a diff budget entirely.

There’s lotsa ways to get in! I’d recommend joining indie gamedev communities &amp; starting to learn about how games get made.

[@SmashWulf](https://twitter.com/SmashWulf/) Yeah, it’s a hard question bc what’s reasonable doesn’t jibe with what covers development costs. A $60 pricepoint has been unsustainable for since the mid-PS3 era. But a $100 game would just be out of a reach for a whole lotta people.
