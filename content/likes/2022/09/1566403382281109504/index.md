ADHD can make it hard to STOP focusing on something. 



This is fucking terrifying cause you can't stop your brain, and you feel out of control.



I once stayed up for over 40 hours, cause I couldn't stop reading this novel. 



My friends had to come make food for me.

<time id="1566403384067952640">[20:30]</time> And it can be anything.. depressive thoughts, intrusive thoughts, people or even emotions. 



Sometimes, this can happen on stuff you want to do, which is why some people like hyperfocus, but personally I hyperfocus on stuff I don't want more than stuff I want.

<time id="1566418042359349251">[21:28]</time> This can especially be an issue cause hyperfocus might be the only way you are able to do things. 



That was the case for me.. my executive function issues were really bad when I was younger  and hyperfocus was the only way I could do anything. 



I had to wait till it hit.

<time id="1566418047514120192">[21:28]</time> I used to believe that hyperfocus was the 'real me'. 



That it reflected my true interests. 



And beat myself when I wasn't able to achieve the same standard as when I was hyperfocusing. 



But on the slipside, that what I hyperfocused on was how In really felt.

<time id="1566420954301059072">[21:40]</time> If I was hyperfocused on a topic, I must love it.



If I was hyperfocused on some intrusive or depressive thought, it must be how I felt.



If I hyperfocused on a person.. I must really like them. And if I didn't, I must not like them anymore.

<time id="1566472992074391559">[2022-09-05 01:07] </time> I still don't start things when I get the feeling that I'm going be obsessed with it.



I can't control it but I can kinda feel when something is going to be hard to put down. 



I have a rule to not start something after 12, unless I don't wanna get any sleep that night.

<time id="1566564224243040256">[2022-09-05 07:09] </time> Oop, linking this now cause I'd completely forgotten I'd written this two years ago. 



It's on getting past the need to rely on hyperfocus to do things.
