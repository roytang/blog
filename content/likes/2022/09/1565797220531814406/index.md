I've been covering bad parts of the internet for long time now.



For years, there was one site extremist researchers warned me not to cover because publicizing it would be dangerous.



But it's time people know KiwiFarms—and how they're chasing political enemies around the world.

<time id="1565798252670238722">[04:26]</time> KiwiFarms was created by former 8chan adminstrator Josh Moon.



8chan founder, Fred Brennan, spent the last few years trying to get 8chan removed from the internet for the harm it causes.



“What Moon is doing is worse,” Brennan told me. "He’s actually targeting specific people."

<time id="1565798855261802497">[04:28]</time> How is KiwiFarms worse than 4chan and 8chan?



Three people the site have targeted later died by suicide.



Some are harassed even after their death by the site's organized mob, who brigade social media pages of loved ones.

<time id="1565799821243551744">[04:32]</time> Why is KiwiFarms more dangerous than any other site?



Its far-right userbase abuses all of the private data companies have accrued over the last decade—then weaponizes it against perceived enemies.



Take their latest target Clara Sorrenti, who had to flee the country last week. 

{{< photos 1565799821243551744 >}}

<time id="1565801244433817602">[04:38]</time> KiwiFarms archives data of political enemies — frequently trans people, often private citizens — then uses it to create terror.



They doxx and swat enemies. They identify enemies' friend and bosses, then bombard them with accusations of pedophilia to get them fired. 

{{< photos 1565801244433817602 >}}

<time id="1565801921109270530">[04:40]</time> Clara Sorrenti was the most recent victim of the KiwiFarms playbook.



Last month, she opened her door to find a police officer's gun pointed at her face.



A KiwiFarms user had sent in a threat of a mass shooting at her local city hall in her name. 

{{< photos 1565801921109270530 >}}

<time id="1565802599768539137">[04:43]</time> Sorrenti had a following and decided to push back, starting a campaign to cut off KiwiFarms' hosting.



She went to a hotel, and took a picture with her cat, telling fans she was safe.



KiwiFarms users identified her hotel by the bedsheets and the threats increased. 

{{< photos 1565802599768539137 >}}

<time id="1565803299080753154">[04:46]</time> By this point, the Uber accounts for Sorrenti and her immediate family had been hacked by KiwiFarms users. They then had access to her every movement and address she'd been to for weeks.



Her family started receiving automated calls like the one below.

<time id="1565803973671636995">[04:48]</time> Realizing she needed to flee the country, Sorrenti flew to Northern Ireland to evade the swatting and stalking.



Within days, KiwiFarms and 4chan users found out where she was staying. One took a picture outside of the home.



(Note: Troon is a KiwiFarms slur for trans person.) 

{{< photos 1565803973671636995 >}}

<time id="1565804557430661121">[04:51]</time> Sorrenti's life, like many others, has been turned upside down by this website.



Even the cops that swatted her were later doxxed and threatened by KiwiFarms users.



There is currently no recourse to stop this kind of fascist terror. 

{{< photos 1565804557430661121 >}}

<time id="1565805134600441856">[04:53]</time> I'm writing about KiwiFarms now because their playbook of terror is being adopted by far-right internet spaces across the web.



Boston Children's Hospital was locked down due to a bomb threat this week.



KiwiFarms and 4chan users clogged an LGBTQ suicide hotline a day later. 

{{< photos 1565805134600441856 >}}

<time id="1565805670342983684">[04:55]</time> The KiwiFarms playbook—using our data to terrorize political enemies—is where the culture war is headed in 2022 and 2024.



Trans people are their current targets, but they are broadening their enemies list.



As Brennan told me, this could "easily become an FBI agent database." 

{{< photos 1565805670342983684 >}}

<time id="1565806008458514437">[04:56]</time> In fact, Marjorie Taylor Greene was caught in the crossfire just last week.



The congresswoman was swatted two nights in a row. The caller, using that similar automated voice message, cited KiwiFarms. 

{{< photos 1565806008458514437 >}}

<time id="1565806652103827461">[04:59]</time> Here's my story with [@kattenbarge](https://twitter.com/kattenbarge/) on KiwiFarms and how political terror will look going into 2024.



They are weaponizing your data to terrorize political dissidents — and they're broadening what they view to be an enemy every day.



I hope you read it.

<time id="1566192294725820416">[2022-09-04 06:31] </time> Update: Cloudflare, the hosting provider for KiwiFarms, has dropped them from accessing their services.



This will make it extremely hard for them to stay online.



Cloudflare had put out a statement standing by hosting the site earlier this week.



https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/09/03/cloudflare-drops-kiwifarms/

<time id="1566192771605708800">[2022-09-04 06:33] </time> What does KiwiFarms losing their hosting mean for their online gang’s future?



For one, much of its userbase has predicted this in the last week, and has moved to Telegram. They’ll keep going.



But their massive archive of doxxes and targets will be a lot less easy to find.

<time id="1566195172278509577">[2022-09-04 06:43] </time> Here’s the statement from Cloudflare about KiwiFarms. 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/ellievhall/status/1566190436615700480/" label="ellievhall's tweet" %}}

BREAKING: Cloudflare has blocked Kiwi Farms.
