Right, everyone. I need to be serious for a moment. Because the greatest thing that ever happened is happening right now.



I don't particularly care either way about the Queen. But the queue? The Queue is a triumph of Britishness. It's incredible.

<time id="1570067807634587649">[23:11]</time> Just to be clear: I don't mean the purpose of the queue. I don't mean the outpouring of emotion or collective gried or the event at the end and around the queue or the people in the queue. I mean, literally, the queue. The queue itself. It's like something from Douglas Adams.

<time id="1570067808947519488">[23:11]</time> It is the motherlode of queues. It is art. It is poetry. It is the queue to end all queues. It opened earlier today and is already 2.2 miles long. They will close it if it gets to FIVE MILES. That's a queue that would take TWO HOURS TO WALK at a brisk pace.

<time id="1570067810310660097">[23:11]</time> It is a queue that goes right through the entirety of London. It has toilets and water points and websites just for The Queue.



You cannot leave The Queue. You cannot get into The Queue further down. You cannot hold places in The Queue. There are wristbands for The Queue.

<time id="1570067811736686592">[23:11]</time> Once you join The Queue you can expect to be there for days. But you cannot have a chair and a sleeping bag. There is no sleeping in The Queue, for The Queue moves constantly and steadily, day and night. You will be shuffling along at 0.1 miles per hour for days.

<time id="1570067813200445440">[23:11]</time> There is a YouTube channel, Twitter feed and Instagram page, each giving frequent updates about The Queue. Because the back of The Queue, naturally, keeps moving. To join The Queue requires up to the minute knowledge of where The Queue is now.

<time id="1570067814630801408">[23:11]</time> The BBC has live coverage of The Queue on BBC One, and a Red Button service showing the front bit of The Queue.



NO ONE IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD JOIN THE QUEUE AND YET STILL THEY COME. "Oh, it'll only be until 6am on Thursday, we can take soup".

<time id="1570067816048476160">[23:11]</time> And the end of the queue is a box. You will walk past the box, slowly, but for no more than a minute. Then you will exit into the London drizzle and make your way home.

<time id="1570067817436745730">[23:11]</time> Tell me this isn't the greatest bit of British performance art that has ever happened? I'm giddy with joy. It's fantastic. We are a deeply, deeply mad people with an absolutely unshakeable need to join a queue. It's utterly glorious.

<time id="1571189353866461186">[2022-09-18 01:28] </time> If you made it to the end, please enjoy The Queue Psalm
