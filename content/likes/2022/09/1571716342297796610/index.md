Re. Last night’s #TrumpRally: While often taking on the appearance of entertainment, rallies actually serve an incredibly important purpose in fascist movements, and we’d be wise not to write them off as a sideshow that can be ignored. 1/

<time id="1571716345024204802">[12:22]</time> Trump’s supporters don’t go to his rallies to be lied to; they go to participate in the process of co-creating a false reality that relies on social proof to survive. It’s a performance in which they must all take part — a collective reshaping of reality. A partnership. 2/

<time id="1571716346571890689">[12:22]</time> The purpose of Trump’s style of authoritarian propaganda is not just to deceive people — it’s to articulate and reinforce what the crowd already believes to be true, and to encourage individuals to unify around this false reality and make it their own. 3/

<time id="1571716352221511683">[12:22]</time> The finger-raising thing? I don’t know what it means, and honestly they might not know either. The point is the spectacle — the quasi-religious experience of a mass public ritual that, above all, serves as a public demonstration of their commitment to the shared delusion. 4/

<time id="1571716354788724736">[12:22]</time> Last night’s rally ticked a lot of boxes on the fascism checklist:



-Talk of an “invasion” of foreigners

-Warning that “sicko leftists” are “indoctrinating” and “destroying our youth”

-Fear-mongering about “skyrocketing” crime

-Denying the legitimacy of political opponents



5/

<time id="1571716356575465472">[12:22]</time> #TrumpRally fascism checklist, continued:



-Turning political rivals into enemies and existential threats to be destroyed

-Seizing upon the collective fears &amp; anxieties of the crowd, then transforming them into mass disdain for immigrants, trans folks, leftists, &amp; others.



6/

<time id="1571716358202613760">[12:22]</time> #TrumpRally fascism checklist, continued:



-Denying the legitimacy of elections

-Portraying the US as a crime-ridden, immoral nation in decline — and offering himself as the only one who can save it.

-Attacking the press as the “enemy of the people”



7/

<time id="1571716359637041152">[12:22]</time> #TrumpRally fascism checklist, continued:



-Attacking the FBI, the DOJ, the J6 Committee, and other institutions designed to hold power accountable.

-Attacking our public education system

-Claiming that Democrats “hate America” and want to “destroy it”

<time id="1571716367505555456">[12:22]</time> The propaganda at last night’s #TrumpRally wasn’t new. We’ve heard it many times before — often, verbatim. Here’s just one example.



The repetition is purposeful. Both for cognitive effects &amp; cultural meaning — like the retelling of ancient myths about 5-headed monsters. 9/ 

{{< photos 1571716367505555456 >}}

<time id="1571716370211180550">[12:22]</time> The repetition of these myths is aided by the well-oiled machinery of the right-wing media ecosystem, which functions like a hall of mirrors and helps legitimize the false reality. This is key to keeping people constantly engaged, mobilized, &amp; immersed in the false reality. 10/

<time id="1571716371838369792">[12:22]</time> But that’s not all. While Trump is mobilizing the mob at rallies and the media is feeding them constant content to help shape &amp; define their shared false reality, Trump’s allies &amp; loyalists are also hard at work, each with a unique role to play in this assault on democracy. 11/

<time id="1571716378419249155">[12:22]</time> Gen. Michael Flynn is really commanding the show. With his “ReAwaken America Tour”, he’s creating a movement that is nothing short of QAnon 2.0, except with more Christian nationalism and a lot more money behind it. It’s an influence machine, and he knows how to drive it. 12/

<time id="1571716386048671745">[12:22]</time> Steve Bannon and Roger Stone are two other major figures involved in the ReAwaken America Tour. Along w/ Flynn, they’re weaponizing sociocultural issues to craft a conspiratorial, apocalyptic narrative that wraps right-wing ideology in biblical language &amp; imagery. 13/ 

{{< photos 1571716386048671745 >}}

<time id="1571716388439441411">[12:22]</time> There’s much more to say about this, and I’ll get to it soon, but the tldr is that these rallies are part of a sophisticated, multi-pronged attack on democracy that combines elements of Cambridge Analytica-style targeting with QAnon-style participatory disinformation... 14/

<time id="1571716390591111171">[12:22]</time> …plus Christian nationalism and authoritarian fear-mongering &amp; scapegoating. This is a huge coalition involving militias, churches, media, think tanks, nonprofits, celebrities, influencers, elected officials, local political parties, Trump loyalists, &amp; more.



It’s a machine. 15/

<time id="1571716391971000321">[12:22]</time> They’re trying to sell fascism to America by inviting supporters to take part in the creation of a new national fiction. This isn’t just politicians lying to citizens — it’s an entire movement focused on shattering our shared reality &amp; replacing it with their ideology. 16/

<time id="1571716393355067396">[12:22]</time> This is, in many ways, a high-stakes battle of narratives — and unfortunately, fascists are great storytellers. 17/
