Okay, I will tell this story again because it's very meaningful to me and it's been a long time since I told it last. 



This is why I can't write Howard The Duck.

[@GailSimone](https://twitter.com/GailSimone/) I must say I agree with you, Steve Gerber was my hero in terms of writing comics. If it were up to me I'd leave Howard alone and just re-read his issues and be satisfied at that. To qualify my statement - IF Marvel doesn't leave him alone, you'd be the one I'd trust with him.
