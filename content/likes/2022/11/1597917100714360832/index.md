Been trying to recall that blog/website where I first met [@helgaplant](https://twitter.com/helgaplant/) [@AdeMagnaye](https://twitter.com/AdeMagnaye/) [@baddie](https://twitter.com/baddie/) [@hilarion](https://twitter.com/hilarion/) I can't remember it was a funny blog (?) by someone with "chicken" in their username??? Everyone was always in the comments and that was where I found their individual blogs too

A small tragedy of the internet: The blogs of the early 2000s literally shifted culture (pop or otherwise) as we know it. But I'm going back to some old famous ones trying to read them and most JUST DON'T EXIST ANYMORE. All that culture-shifting writing just GONE.
