You know, if Disney wanted to do something actually gutsy with Star Wars, they'd make a new trilogy that finally confronted the whole thing about droids. You know the thing I'm talking about.



They're slaves, you guys.

<time id="1587804239371411456">[21:50]</time> Droids are repeatedly shown to be able to think, feel emotions, feel *pain,* tell jokes, express concern, express empathy, display bravery, and yet whenever the plot demands it even our heroes routinely do shit like wipe their memories, reprogram them, etc.

<time id="1587804522830876676">[21:51]</time> And that's the problem, at this point. If you ever got around to doing a "Measure of a Man" style story about the droids of the Star Wars universe, it retroactively paints a LOT of our heroes with a really bad brush.

<time id="1587804988566343680">[21:53]</time> "Solo"  had a droid character who said this out loud, repeatedly, through the movie, and it was not only played as a joke about her "malfunctioning," her character also ends with her brain shoved into the  Falcon's navigational computer in an I-have-no-mouth-but-I-must-scream.

<time id="1587805242548158464">[21:54]</time> Like "haha, worldbuilding! Everybody's favorite thousand-dollar Lego set contains the mind and soul of a sentient being whose entire goal in life was to free artificial life forms from their shackles!"

<time id="1587805813820751872">[21:56]</time> The Star Wars movies explicitly know that droids are people, because whenever they want to demonstrate that someone is A Bad Guy they show them behaving abusively towards droids. Jabba's palace staff tortures and dismantles "disobedient" droids.

<time id="1587806169921654789">[21:57]</time> Like, they've invested hours and hours of time into making us love the droids. They keep giving us new ones, too: BB-8, K-2SO, L0-LA - they know that when a droid explodes we don't think of it as them "breaking," we think of it as them "dying."

<time id="1587806350955974656">[21:58]</time> The scariest moment in the original Star Wars, for kids, is likely the moment that R2-D2 gets fried during the Death Star trench run and you're not sure they'll be able to fix them.

<time id="1587806767844663296">[22:00]</time> It's time for a droid to be the main character of a story, instead of a sidekick designed to sell more toys. It's time for a Star Wars movie to seriously take up the cause of droid freedom.

<time id="1587806860320595975">[22:00]</time> I think it's time for a droid who wants to be a Jedi.

<time id="1587807030441558017">[22:01]</time> I'm not super-enmeshed in the expanded universe of stuff, so I'm not sure if 1) that's ever been tried before or 2) if a droid's ever been demonstrated to be able to really use the Force, but it doesn't actually matter if the character succeeds at that.

<time id="1587807184909438976">[22:01]</time> What would matter is a droid motivated by those ideals, trying to behave how a Jedi would, with the aim of freeing his people.

<time id="1587807401176141824">[22:02]</time> The best moment in "Solo" incidentally is when the robots, told to free their brethren, also free the wookiees because they don't really see a flesh/metal distinction, they just see other creatures in bondage.

<time id="1587807571448037377">[22:03]</time> Star Wars has traditionally been *terrible* about addressing slavery, of course - if the Jedi had been more devoted to the cause of freeing the slaves, Darth Vader wouldn't have arisen to wipe them all out.

<time id="1587807864571273223">[22:04]</time> My friend [@IllusiveKen](https://twitter.com/IllusiveKen/) often says that the plot of the prequel trilogy should've been Anakin and Owen bombing around the galaxy trying to free all the slaves, and it's hard to argue with that idea.

<time id="1587808105647296514">[22:05]</time> Like, the Jedi meet Anakin, a gifted child languishing in a backwater planet and instead of being outraged at the entire institution they're like "we should bring this kid, and only this kid, with us. We should absolutely leave his mom here, she'll probably be fine."

<time id="1587808268000305155">[22:06]</time> Like yeah, "Jedi don't form attachments," but like at least free his mom and take her to a nice planet to retire on instead of leaving her to toil in the unending desert.

<time id="1587808577007263748">[22:07]</time> Anyway, a droid who wants to free the slaves would want to free *all* the slaves. So sure, all the tortured droids out there, but also the wookiee laborers, the oft-killed bothans, the brainwashed child soldiers of the First Order, all of them.

<time id="1587809225077673985">[22:09]</time> If you're using any characters from the recent movies to pair up with our droid, the obvious answer would be Rose Tico, the empathetic mechanic who deserves more time to shine.

<time id="1587810005813760004">[22:13]</time> I'm pretty sure no dump trucks of money would ever get Finn back to the series, which is a shame because a parallel story about him freeing his fellow Stormtroopers from their fate SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIS STORY IN RISE OF SKYWALKER ALREADY.

<time id="1587810402934689792">[22:14]</time> Anyway, the longer Star Wars goes on, the more broad and interconnected it becomes, the more streaming shows flesh out the universe â€” the more awkward it becomes that this hasn't been addressed yet. 



Free the droids, Disney.
