Let's say a few words about "brand safety". Musk and top Republican leaders are now complaining that the problem is "woke" activists breaking Twitter and pushing it toward financial collapse. Nope. That's not it. Not remotely. Are there people pushing for boycotts or ...

<time id="1588679840009400321">[07:49]</time> 2/ "pauses"? Absolutely. But that's not why Twitter is in trouble. It's not just that advertisers don't want their ads showing up next to Kanye West ranting about how his Jewish doctor wanted to have him eliminated. It goes way beyond that. Advertisers don't want to be ...

<time id="1588679841897140224">[07:49]</time> 3/ near controversy. And they don't even want to be near things that are upsetting or agitating. This is why ALL political media faces an inverse premium in advertising because the content is inherently polarizing. You can sell the same ads, watched by the same number of ...

<time id="1588679843532931072">[07:49]</time> 4/ people and actually the same people and you can get more money if the content is fashion or parenthood or entertainment than if it's politics. It's because there's hate speech or terrible things. But advertisers won't you to see their ads in a good moment, in a comfortable ...

<time id="1588679845302898689">[07:49]</time> 5/ setting. Here's an example. Why do you think even in his heyday Drudge never had better than low rent, crap ads, and tshirt and supplement ads on his site. Mostly because even though it was a hugely hugely popular site premium advertisers just don't want to be near something..

<time id="1588679846980636673">[07:49]</time> 6/ so hot and contentious. Half the people are hate reading anyway. There's always a big inverse premium for uck and discomfort and controversy. That's just how the ad business works. The nature of the advertising market is actually a big BIG reason for bothsides ...

<time id="1588679848754524160">[07:49]</time> 7/ journalism. In a politically polarized society advertising are very VERY cautious about any hint they're taking sides in the great political or factional debates. They want to put their odds in venues that are above any hint that they're partisan or taking sides.

<time id="1588679850478342144">[07:49]</time> 8/ It's not that these places get no advertising. But there's a huge inverse premium. The exceptions are venues that have something that can't be matched. All the post-2016 controversy notwithstanding this is why Facebook was so successful. Especially ROI advertisers ...

<time id="1588679852189966336">[07:49]</time> 9/ just believed they couldn't not be there. All the crap on Facebook was just something they had to live with because the power of the ad ecosystem was just too good. Twitter has never had that. It's never been a particularly attractive ad buy. That's for a million ...

<time id="1588679853829914627">[07:49]</time> 10/ reasons. But that's why Facebook was a cash cow and Twitter has never done better than break even. Musk basically bought Twitter on a lark. He was riding so high he thought he could basically buy Twitter with Fuck You money. Since then he's been operating on the ...

<time id="1588679855524442112">[07:49]</time> 11/ premise that he could both be Mr Free Speech (tm) memelord and make Twitter operate at a profit. It's one or the other. No advertiser wants to be near this drama or controversy let alone the next N-word explosion. It's not the activists fault. If you want to ...

<time id="1588679857176997888">[07:49]</time> 12/ run a fancy restaurant, you don't put an open air outhouse in the middle of the dining area. Just not how it works. Maybe it's your thing. Not how it works. You don't get the blame the people who say ewwww it's way smelly.

<time id="1588679858837520384">[07:49]</time> 13/ How do I know this? I worked in publishing side advertising in political media for years. This is how it works. None of it is remotely surprising.

<time id="1588681020412395522">[07:54]</time> 14/ Sorry for the wild number of typos. Middle of something else and I was writing quickly. END.
