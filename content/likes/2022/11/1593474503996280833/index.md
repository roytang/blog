all the why Elon Musk bought Twitter theories are overthinking it. 



it’s simple. 



Musk is in a right wing filter bubble. he bought Twitter believing their problems were real &amp; that others felt the same



this is what happens when you have a lot of money &amp; live in fantasy land

<time id="1593475994274381824">[13:27]</time> just look at Elon Musk’s private texts that were released 



this isn’t some strategic genius move



it’s a bunch of out-of-touch weirdos angry at “woke culture” and thinking the rest of the world shares their bizarre fixations on this stuff

reminder that Elon Musk and his ex-wife Talulah Riley texted back-and-forth about buying Twitter (before he publicly offered to)...because Babylon Bee got suspended lol

<time id="1593478939413995521">[13:39]</time> Elon Musk recently deleted a tweet claiming Twitter was the largest driver of traffic in the internet



this is nowhere near true!



why did he believe this? because his right wing bubble is obsessed with this platform. he believed it’s outsized importance because of them.

<time id="1593482057782595584">[13:51]</time> Elon Musk has regularly replied to complaints from right wingers on Twitter since taking over 



who else receives this kind of attention from him



he’s surrounded himself with this stuff. it’s all he sees on his feeds

<time id="1593494280139669505">[14:40]</time> Elon Musk’s $8 plan for a verified badge is obviously about money



but why did he think there was a market for this?



because right wingers on here are obsessed with the blue check!



in reality, only around 150,000 signed up for Musk’s plan so far &amp; many of them are right wingers

Twitter data suggests most of the people buying Twitter Blue are promoting three things: right wing politics, cryptocurrency, and porn. https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/11/16/musk-twitter-email-ultimatum-termination/

<time id="1593649412181561346">[2022-11-19 00:56] </time> lets not forget the VCs in Elon Musk's orbit who he immediately brought on board to help him run Twitter



take David Sacks for example. these are the people who have his ear.
