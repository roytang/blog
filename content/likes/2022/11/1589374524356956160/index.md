So it seems obvious that Mastodon makes a lot of sense (ingenious really) once you let go of some ingrained existing paradigms.



🧵

<time id="1589374526147923969">[05:49]</time> Let’s say you are a reputable news org, you have a close server http://reputable.news 



Everyone that works for you is at jane@reputable.news or tom@reputable.news and have a main account at latest@reputable.news



Instant solve for impersonation

<time id="1589374528136052737">[05:49]</time> For personal use - i have tech crew and art crew, so having a diff handle at 2 diff servers a .social and .art optimizes for community discovery (as well as who i follow) and YES you can follow cross server!

<time id="1589374529801191426">[05:49]</time> Anyways, so far it’s been good, some servers are slow, but give them a dollar over at [@Patreon](https://twitter.com/Patreon/) or some oss help if you can



Be the change you want to see in the world kinda thing.

<time id="1589374531487305728">[05:49]</time> Due to its various policies and lack thereof, twitter has done quite a bit of real damage to the world.  I think Mastodon has taken some of its best dynamics of idea amplification while limiting harm.



Bullish on Mastodon 😊

<time id="1589375111681146880">[05:52]</time> O also! Omg an art specific server with a specific ban on hawking nfts!!!
