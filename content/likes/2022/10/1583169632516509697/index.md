so here's a story



I volunteer helping seniors with their technology issues. One of my regulars came in with a Lenovo laptop. It still had a retail sticker; I imagine she bought it used, for over $500



"I bought this so recently, how is it already so slow," she asked me 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/ShannonVallor/status/1559659655097376768/" label="ShannonVallor's tweet" %}}

The saddest thing for me about modern tech’s long spiral into user manipulation and surveillance is how it has just slowly killed off the joy that people like me used to feel about new tech. Every product Meta or Amazon announces makes the future seem bleaker and grayer. 1/n

<time id="1583170400397426688">[02:56]</time> I fire up the task manager to get a look at things



She's right: her CPU capacity is SATURATED at regular intervals. The laptop is barely usable.



Digging into the list of processes, there's all kinds of Lenovo branded junkware running in the background.

<time id="1583171011352047616">[02:59]</time> A quick Google search confirms this is a common issue on these machines. I try to launch Lenovo's frontend for all of this junk...



and it gets so much worse. All this hideous Lenovo branding in an unnecessary splash screen, leading to a hideous app of zero value

<time id="1583171477343346688">[03:01]</time> As I'm digging around I realize what's going on: Lenovo wants surveillance turf



They want a "relationship" with the customer that's a thinly veiled back door into their machine. How often does the trackpad REALLY need a firmware update?



I ask my client for consent to remove it

<time id="1583171888318402561">[03:02]</time> The challenge is that now with this garbage program running in the foreground, the whole machine has truly ground to a halt



It takes me five minutes (!) of the limited time in our appointment even to access the Add/Remove Programs panel, so slow is everything running

<time id="1583172756170231809">[03:06]</time> After explaining the situation to the client, I purge EVERYTHING related to this Lenovo branded surveillance garbage from the machine, just as we're running out of time.



And instantly: it's usable again. CPU graph cools down, UI becomes reliably responsive again.

<time id="1583173204914622465">[03:08]</time> And it just makes me so angry



This technology is non-negotiable, at this point, even for seniors. They need it to keep in touch with people, to participate in cultural and civic life



And these companies are just CONTAMINATING the every day experience with surveillance crapware

<time id="1583173936170532864">[03:10]</time> My client paid hundreds of dollars for the privilege of using a machine that had been sabotaged by the greed and incompetence of its manufacturer



And they had no recourse at all. How are they supposed to figure this out? With what mental models?

<time id="1583175273406955520">[03:16]</time> It's funny, working in the industry, how often you can smell some dickweasel's little OKR in the inexplicable frustrations of someone who just wants to use their laptop, phone, tablet… but they're derailed by a popup, unnecessary login or other waste of time



Truly an affliction

<time id="1583176684626640896">[03:21]</time> Maybe the most frustrating thing for me is how often I'm working with people who are apologetic and unsure BECAUSE of these derailments



They think it's their fault! They think they're not capable of doing things BECAUSE they keep getting fucked with by this user-hostile crap

<time id="1583177307237208064">[03:24]</time> I spend a lot of time explaining the same thing over and over again



"It's not your fault. You didn't do anything wrong. You're completely capable of making sense of this machine. It's just that some asshole got a bonus for trying to confuse you so a little graph would go up."

<time id="1583478536161329153">[23:21]</time> Getting lots of questions about how to do this on Lenovo and other machines. YMMV, but here's what I did:



Add/Remove Programs, in Windows. Then I found everything from Lenovo and uninstalled.



You can use this support article to get started:



https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uninstall-or-remove-apps-and-programs-in-windows-4b55f974-2cc6-2d2b-d092-5905080eaf98

<time id="1583479789939105792">[23:26]</time> Meanwhile, I enjoy Steven's war stories, so I got quite a bit of mirth from this drive-by.



I do quite a bit of retro-computing too. These points are orthogonal to the OP's issue:



the INCENTIVES of providers to fuck the consumer are so much worse now

I understand where this is coming from but “rose colored glasses” come to mind. 



I’ve spent the better part of a year installing on vintage hw, using, and documenting the history of the primary products from 1981 forward. There’s no comparison at all. Today is orders better. 1/3 https://twitter.com/_danilo/status/1583169632516509697

<time id="1583480171063279616">[23:27]</time> It's depressing to be a technologist today because the industry around us is committed to all manner of cheesedick nonsense to goose the quarterly numbers of this or that or the other thing



and so much of it built on surveillance that would not have been practical in the past

<time id="1583480676682113027">[23:29]</time> I understand the incentives of an architect of today's order to defend it



But it doesn't change the facts: it was easier to be excited by technology 20 years ago. Today it requires constant scrutiny and skepticism because of the dubious ethics of an entire industry

<time id="1583480936053633024">[23:30]</time> Every new device, service, software, you have to ask: what creepy shit are these guys trying to pull? Who am I letting onto my network? What are the downsides of their incentives relative to mine?



It used to just be fun.
