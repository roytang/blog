So a bunch of you are not Terminally Online which is fine. I'm kind of jealous if I'm honest. Lemme catch you up.



A lesbian hobby farmer in Florida owns an emu and went viral (hahaha) for him pecking the camera while she tried to record videos for TikTok. 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/NeolithicSheep/status/1583221919339679744/" label="NeolithicSheep's tweet" %}}

Unless you're going to yell at them about STOP FUCKING LICKING THE PLAGUE INFESTED EMU. It is OK to yell about that.

{{% /quoted %}}

<time id="1583443162693267462">[21:00]</time> At which point people noticed she was the same white lesbian who had been racist in previous attempts to build a platform on TikTok. But this time she had her money maker in the form of the emu and portraying herself as wholesome and Christian and lesbian.

<time id="1583443178085982208">[21:00]</time> A few days ago she posts a thread about how she's had a problem with Egyptian Geese landing at her place and they had brought in Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). She had lost all of her poultry to it except, miraculously, the viral (hahaha) money making emu.

<time id="1583443239339954176">[21:01]</time> He of course is battling for his life, will only eat if hand fed, and has nerve damage in one leg that means he cannot stand unassisted so they've rigged a sling for him.

<time id="1583443246633451521">[21:01]</time> She posts pictures of herself lying in his bedding with her face near his and with her face pressed against his. She tells people they're following "FDA" regulations and not to say anything negative.

<time id="1583443253009211392">[21:01]</time> I am pretty sure by "FDA" she means FDACS, the Florida Dept of Ag. But she's not following their regs, because she won't wear a mask around the emu because she claims it stresses him out.

<time id="1583443258599870465">[21:01]</time> People have found her farm listed as having an HPAI outbreak on the FDACS website, so she definitely reported it. The thing is that when you report an outbreak, FDACS sends a team of trained personnel in hazmat suits to euthanize your birds.

<time id="1583443265009119232">[21:01]</time> There is no fucking around. Although the CDC currently lists the strain of HPAI circulating in North America as low risk to humans, it is not NO risk and what we know is that it can and does jump to humans who have close contact with sick birds.

<time id="1583443272445308930">[21:01]</time> In other countries, HPAI has been shown to be transmissible between humans who have close contact. It's also transmissible to dogs, cats, martens, and pigs. That we know of.

<time id="1583443280435752962">[21:01]</time> HPAI also has a 50% death rate in humans so far. Nobody wants to find out what happens if it mutates and becomes easily transmissible between humans. There is no vaccine. Have you read THE STAND? Go read THE STAND.

<time id="1583445293290631168">[21:09]</time> Every human being who gets the virus is a risk for it to mutate and adapt better to being transmitted between humans. And so if you have HPAI, the govt sends people in hazmat suits to euthanize your birds.

<time id="1583445355257294849">[21:09]</time> There is no "this one is a pet, not livestock" exemption. There is no "oh but this one is famous" exemption. There is no "oh but I have a weird parasocial relationship with this one" exemption.

<time id="1583445370159640576">[21:09]</time> She had to have lied to FDACS and/or concealed the emu from them. She certainly did not tell FDACS she had an emu with HPAI as she should have done, or he would have been euthanized, as he should have been.

<time id="1583445399884693504">[21:09]</time> Instead she lied and/or concealed the emu and engaged in high risk behaviors like putting her face up against his and spending large amounts of time with him while not wearing appropriate PPE.

<time id="1583445417274257408">[21:09]</time> She's not just risking her life, she's risking becoming patient zero for an apocalyptic flu outbreak that makes COVID look tame.

<time id="1583445430506909696">[21:09]</time> Like feel how you're gonna feel about your parasocial relationship with the emu but her behavior is wildly irresponsible and actively unethical.

<time id="1583463934891560961">[22:23]</time> Since some folks want to be dubious about the death rate, let me be very specific. What's circulating right now is HPAI H5N1.

https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/reported-human-infections.htm#:~:text=HPAI%20A(H5N1)%20virus%20infections,19%20countries%20since%20November%202003.

<time id="1583467751154552832">[22:38]</time> Relevant short thread about attitudes to the emu

Wait I can't believe Asians sat through decades of being insulted about our food and our relationship to various animals and white influencers that have farms can just chill with a bird that has bird flu for clout

<time id="1583468366278561793">[22:40]</time> Thread from back when she first viral (hahaha) discussing racism issues

<time id="1583490847420469248">[2022-10-22 00:10] </time> I like all the people telling me to report this to FDACS. My family in Christ, the only things I have more information on than you, apparently, are the transmissibility and lethality of HPAI H5N1.



Well also I apparently have a working phone with internet access and y'all don't?

<time id="1583490850432364544">[2022-10-22 00:10] </time> This "you have made me aware of the problem therefore you must fix it so I am no longer uncomfortable" thing is symptomatic of many problems with humans at large. I regret to inform you I am merely a farmer and activist and have no special power to fix this.

<time id="1583494305666039818">[2022-10-22 00:23] </time> Anyway it's traditional when a thread gets play to sell you something so if you've made it this far let me tell you about [@ASEELApp](https://twitter.com/ASEELApp/), which you can find at https://aseelapp.com/



There you can send emergency aid to Afghanistan or shop directly from Afghan artisans.
