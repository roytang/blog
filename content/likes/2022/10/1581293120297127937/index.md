I mean, I responded to a "am I satisfied with your customer service" prompt with "no, but please don't ding the CSR's metrics, I just want to provide quantitative data that consumers have noticed the overwork" and I still feel incredibly guilty about it.

The fact that consumers see leaving anything less than a 5 star review as a borderline assault on the merchant’s livelihood is a big problem. 



Normalize leaving middling reviews people! Giving everything 5 stars isn’t helpful. https://twitter.com/MrJonesSTRs/status/1581274945862397953
