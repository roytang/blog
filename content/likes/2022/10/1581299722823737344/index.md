Absolutely agree. Just like YouTube has become the biggest music distributor, the podcast-talk-show scene brings additional value to audiences looking for a podcast-like experience on their preferred platform. Itâ€™s not so much pivot to YouTube as taking two bites, same apple.

I am, surprisingly, kind of ok with podcasts being distributed as videos? Because YouTube has become the main way I consume content that would have normally been a podcast.
