THREAD: A tale in two tweets and one FCC chairman 

{{< photos 1582174586153553920 >}}

<time id="1582175815856402432">[09:04]</time> One of Reagan's most far-reaching acts as president was appointing Mark Fowler as the chairman of the FCC in 1981. Fowler went on to massively deregulate television, especially children's television.



https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1983/12/23/fcc-weakens-policy-on-tv-for-children/f1404264-0c27-42ba-862a-ded4c9a7e435/

<time id="1582176846111641602">[09:08]</time> This ushered in a massive sea change in children's TV. Educational shows like Schoolhouse Rock got the axe; they were replaced with shows like Transformers and G.I. Joe, which were created expressly to market toys to children.

<time id="1582178403758665729">[09:15]</time> Saturday morning cartoons of the 1980s were the first time advertisers had a single dominant venue where they could market directly to children unmediated by parents or educators. They could directly tell the nation's 6-year-olds "You won't be happy unless you own this toy."

<time id="1582180637561135104">[09:23]</time> Result: The branded childhood. In-demand toys existed before the 1980s, of course, but it never had a fraction of the reach, homogeneity, and--especially--tie-in branding that was created in the 1950s.

<time id="1582187503703818241">[09:51]</time> The franchise tie-in toys are the most obvious effect; the colorful, non-IP castles and play houses of the mid-20th century fell by the wayside in favor of toys that turned every play experience into a way to reinforce brand loyalty.

<time id="1582187970806788098">[09:53]</time> What do you get when you raise an entire generation of plastic young brains to associate all their positive childhood experiences with a franchise?



Well, you get this. 

{{< photos 1582187970806788098 >}}

<time id="1582190760727715840">[10:04]</time> We now have a generation of adults in their 30s and 40s who are neurologically incapable of differentiating positive feelings from franchises--their brains are wired that way. Nostalgia has always existed, but this is the first generation where it's completely owned by brands.

<time id="1582192870210953216">[10:12]</time> Now that the creators are themselves the product of being marketed to as children, the snake is eating its own tail--both the marketers and the audience want only an endless regurgitation of a commercial for 8-year-olds from 1987.

<time id="1582193178068672512">[10:13]</time> A common line now is "remakes and adaptations have always existed," but it's a deliberately misleading narrative by people who can't accept their own emotional stuntedness. It has never been this bad. Ever.

<time id="1582193940949704704">[10:16]</time> As seen in the first tweet, the consequences for actual creators are catastrophic--our demand for an eternal branded childhood serves to funnel money directly to corporate IP holders and away from anyone trying to make something new and different.

<time id="1582194385675964416">[10:18]</time> In fact away from any creative, period--since the value is in the brand, the money goes to the shareholders who own it and not the writers and artists who do the actual work, so even people working on franchise products usually make poverty wages.

<time id="1582195547628109824">[10:23]</time> There's no clear path to undo the damage. Now that the consolidation is driven not just by corporate corporate interests but by consumer demand, even re-regulating and de-monopolizing the industry wouldn't fix it. Even if we were offered alternatives, we wouldn't take them.

<time id="1582195575818027008">[10:23]</time> Thanks a lot, Reagan.

<time id="1582249127936593920">[13:56]</time> I don't have a Soundcloud etc etc, but I'm working on a werewolf game and the only preexisting IP it contains is some drawings by a 7-year-old boy who lived 800 years ago. Here's Chapter 1.
