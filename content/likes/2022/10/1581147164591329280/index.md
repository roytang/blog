The craziest thing just happened at dinner. I’m at a ramen shop owned by Thai people in Oakland dressed as power rangers, when a woman comes rushing in saying she wasn’t safe—and a man came running in after her and puts her in a chokehold.

<time id="1581197898959626240">[16:18]</time> Why are the employees dressed as power rangers you might ponder? Because this is a ramen-fusion restaurant where their main cocktail is, you guessed it, The Noka Rangers: 

{{< photos 1581197898959626240 >}}

<time id="1581198370206457856">[16:20]</time> Once the woman had expressed she wasn’t safe, and she didn’t want to go home with this man who was choke holding her, the black power ranger (the manager with a kickass bob) and the yellow ranger, told the man to leave.



He swung at them.



This is when all rangers yelled, “Huey!”

<time id="1581199341384933376">[16:24]</time> “Huey” is the Thai expression of the Cantonese “Waaah,” the Korean “Yaaa” and the English, “The fuck?”



&amp; the yellow ranger (who has the sweetest eyes &amp; a sleeve of tats) stood in front of the black ranger &amp; blocked it. Everyone tells the woman to hide in the kitchen.

<time id="1581199841199169537">[16:26]</time> The man starts calling everyone Asian slurs &amp; if Bruce Lee was still alive he’d kick everyone’s asses &amp; beelines for the kitchen.



YellowRanger grabs him by the collar to drag him out of the restaurant. 



Man kicks &amp; hurls punches.



A white guy yells: “Do you want to go to jail?”

<time id="1581200578692014081">[16:29]</time> We’re trying to call the cops. Patrons are shaking &amp; crying. The pink power ranger (hostess) tells us our food is free.



The man goes outside, starts picking up chairs, baby seats &amp; salt + pepper shakers to throw at the windows.



I, for some reason, start wolfing down my ramen.

<time id="1581201323835289601">[16:32]</time> Man comes back with a friend (or another person bugging on the street) to try &amp; fight the power rangers. 



It’s been half an hour &amp; the police still haven’t shown up, despite everyone calling.



My friend receives a AirDrop request to accept photos &amp; she’s like, “The fuck not!”

<time id="1581202024900665345">[16:35]</time> (In retrospect, we’re now curious about this airdrop.)



More swings are swung, more power rangers pile onto the men at the door to lock them out. Locking us in.



I tell the hostess we’re paying her for our meal &amp; double the tip.



She starts shaking.

<time id="1581202703987855362">[16:37]</time> Police finally show up.



Cooks materializes with hairnets in disarray &amp; ready to join the power rangers at the door, but I hear them tell the cops that the man has now started another fight down the pier.



I thank all the rangers for their time.



The Green one said:

<time id="1581203078241341440">[16:39]</time> “We’re beta testing these costumes, but we wore the right outfit tonight.”



Black Power Ranger Manager of the Year with kickass bob says: “I’m a power ranger with absolutely no power.”



We chuckle as more Thai people show up. Presumably the owner of the restaurant.

<time id="1581204728209285120">[16:45]</time> There’s no sense, moral or meaning to this story, except that I can’t believe power rangers are actually Thai? I’m grateful no guns were involved. And the food at Noka Ramen was excellent.
