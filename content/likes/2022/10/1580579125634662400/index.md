Uncomfortable #mtg truths (con’t.): earlier this week I asked this question. It was a trick, because I already knew the answer: players HATED Deluxe Edition, and LOVED The Walking Dead Secret Lair. Twitter gets it wrong. Here’s why… 1/x 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/Billtriesagain/status/1580013294534144001/" label="Billtriesagain's tweet" %}}

#mtg players, which product did players hate more:

{{% /quoted %}}

<time id="1580579127945744389">[23:20]</time> (For those who don’t know me, I’ve worked in the games industry for two decades, 15 years of which was as #WOTCStaff. These are the realities of the tabletop industry, not my opinions.) Product “success” is defined by a basket of things, but here are some of the key ones: 2/x

<time id="1580579129774444544">[23:20]</time> NPS (how much customers like you), user numbers (DAU/WAU/MAU), and sales most importantly (but not exclusively) of all. So let’s look at how those things break down for each of these products: 3/x

<time id="1580579131338936320">[23:20]</time> The Walking Dead Secret Lair was the BEST SELLING secret Lair of all time. (Source: https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2020/12/controversial-the-walking-dead-secret-lair-was-the-best-selling-drop-ever/). The LOUDEST vote your customer can cast is with their $ because it’s the costliest vote they cast. But $ isn’t the only vote they cast… 4/x

<time id="1580579132936982528">[23:20]</time> NPS is a privately held number, so it’s not available to assess directly here. One indirect measurement of it, however, is if a company makes that product again. Guess what happened with these types of secret lairs? (Don’t feel bad if your mind draws a blanka…) 5/x

<time id="1580579134140715010">[23:20]</time> Yep, WOTC continued making them. They believe players like this thing. Why do you think they think that? Finally, if players HATE your product enough to abandon your brand, they’ll leave it. That shows up in usage numbers. Did those numbers crash at that time? 6/x

<time id="1580579135839440897">[23:20]</time> There’s no evidence they did from what’s been publicly stated. A while after Covid hit and play DID crash, but sales did the best ever. That’s strong evidence play crashed from a global pandemic, not negative sentiment from TWD. So what about Deluxe Edition? 7/x

<time id="1580579137185779712">[23:20]</time> For those who need a reminder ([@bmkibler](https://twitter.com/bmkibler/) and [@kellydigges](https://twitter.com/kellydigges/) ) this is that product: https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/throne-eldraine-deluxe-collection-2019-09-19. It was maligned to some extent when it came out on Twitter, but didn’t blow up the internet. How’d it do in the market? 8/x

<time id="1580579138418905088">[23:20]</time> Sales numbers aren’t public for it as far as I can tell, but Wizards NEVER made the product again. That’s a VERY strong indication players voted with their wallets and avoided it. It didn’t cause brand damage measured by user numbers either, but it was a likely sales failure. 9/x

<time id="1580579139693989888">[23:20]</time> So what role does Twitter play here? This is where it gets even more uncomfortable. Twitter HATED The Walking Dead. But #mtg players didn’t as measured by their actions, which is what businesses base decisions on. Why the difference? 10/x

<time id="1580579140809658369">[23:20]</time> Turns out, Twitter #mtg isn’t representative of MTG as a whole. It’s a bubble. The playerbase, based on public accounting, is 10s of millions in size (source: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/10/magic-the-gathering-pop-culture-hit-where-next?CMP=fb_gu). Working as #wotcstaff the est. was 1-2% of play base on Twitter, and that’s generous. 11/x

<time id="1580579142139281408">[23:20]</time> So when you hear loud opinions on Twitter about MTG what you’re hearing are thoughts in an echo chamber. Is it possible that it reflects the broad opinions of the consumer base as a whole? Sure, but the data, what customers DO versus SAY, defines that. After all… 12/x

<time id="1580579143275909120">[23:20]</time> The audience here needs to be in the hundreds of thousands to represent a SINGLE percentage of the player base. Have you seen any #mtg threads with 200,000 individuals all agreeing on the same thing? And don’t forget the business model: 13/x

<time id="1580579144504840192">[23:20]</time> Outrage is the name of the game. It generates engagement, which generates clicks, which builds a brand and leads to sales. The conversational incentives all push in the direction of activating outrage to accomplish your goals. That’s helpful to remember. 14/x

<time id="1580579145758965761">[23:20]</time> What’s the point here? If you care about the #gamedev elements of social media reactions it’s important to listen to what your customers DO, not just what they SAY. The two are often disconnected. Another thing… 15/x

<time id="1580579146874621952">[23:20]</time> I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: a TON of social media talking heads that bang the outrage drum all day are the same ones buying as much of the product they’re trying to get you upset about because they know it’s $ too. It’s hard to acknowledge being manipulated… 16/x

<time id="1580579147885469697">[23:20]</time> One final thing: human instincts will tell you, “But Bill, NO ONE I’ve talked to likes &lt;the thing&gt;!” That is 100% true. But on an audience of 10-35 MILLION, that sample size is 0. And it shows how even well meaning people get trapped in bubbles. 17/x

<time id="1580579149013745667">[23:20]</time> (Full disclosure: I’m here for clicks too. It’s fun talking #MTG after 15 years when I couldn’t, but also to drive traffic to https://makingmythic.com/ where I sell my gaming collectibles from being #wotcstaff. I can afford honesty because it’s a hobby for me!) /end
