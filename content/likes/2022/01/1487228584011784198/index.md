As noted previously, most internet commenters can't follow constructions as simple as an AND, and I don't want to be in the business of trying to convey what I'd like to convey to people who won't bother to understand an AND since I'd rather convey nuance

[@hillelogram](https://twitter.com/hillelogram/) Like, if you read an ask.metafilter question with an AND, you the questioner is probably screwed. 95%-100% of the commenters will drop half of the question and give an answer that's irrelevant. With XOR there's no chance, 100% of answers will be irrelevant virtually all the time.
