When talking about our agendas for the day, I told my 5yo I was a little nervous about a meeting I have today. He said, “Mama, I am nervous all the time. I know what to do.” So friends, here is all the advice he could fit into the drive to school:

<time id="1485973751443382281">[21:52]</time> 1. “You gotta say your affirmations in your mouth and your heart. You say, ‘I am brave of this meeting!’ , ‘I am loved!’, ‘I smell good!’ And you can say five or three or ten until you know it.”

<time id="1485974018910003206">[21:53]</time> 2. “You gotta walk big. You gotta mean it. Like Dolly on a dinosaur. Because you got it.”

<time id="1485974219200552960">[21:53]</time> 3. “Never put a skunk on a bus.”

<time id="1485974578128113667">[21:55]</time> 4. “Think about the donuts of your day! Even if you cry a little, you can think about potato chips!”

<time id="1485975087115292678">[21:57]</time> 5. “You gotta take a deep breath and you gotta do it again.”

<time id="1485976400855289860">[22:02]</time> 6. “Even if it’s a yucky day, you can get a hug.”

<time id="1486093101995331586">[2022-01-26 05:46] </time> Extra addition from this afternoon: “Don’t get distracted and your feet will stay on the sidewalk and not too full of snow.”
