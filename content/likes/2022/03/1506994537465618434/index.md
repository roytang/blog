Two decks I'll be using at the Metagame Challenge + starting guides to them:



- RB Value based on [@crokeyz](https://twitter.com/crokeyz/)'s list, good for the wide meta.



- Naya Runes, good to counter RB Value. 



Remember, it's an 'all-access' event, which means you don't need cards to play!
