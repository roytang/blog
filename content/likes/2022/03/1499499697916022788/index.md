<time id="1499499707441328129">[05:39]</time> (Alright – those were all actionable. Now let's dig into Aspirational)

<time id="1499499708166856704">[05:39]</time> Share 1 mistake you made as a beginner – and what you learned from it.

<time id="1499499712801562627">[05:39]</time> Share your personal playbook – how you achieved some result and the steps you took to get there.

<time id="1499499713531416579">[05:39]</time> (Those were Aspirational – now onto Anthropological)

<time id="1499499714345111555">[05:39]</time> Share 1 thing you believe that everyone else doesn’t – and why you’re correct
