I think I do. Can I give it a shot?



It has to do with the purpose of government.



For some people (like us) purpose of government is to help people. We think fairness is possible, and that the government's job is to try to create fairness.



Others have a different worldview.

I don't understand this willingness of Senate Republicans to ruin the lives of people who voted for them in order to own the libs. https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/1556313038554267649

<time id="1556420032355131393">[07:20]</time> Hierarchy people, in contrast, think there’s a natural order: Some people belong on top. Others are at the bottom. 



They think that people with money and power have that money and power because they deserve it. 



2/

<time id="1556420227549671424">[07:21]</time> An example: The white supremacy theories that informed the Confederacy. 



Hierarchy people don’t believe equality is possible because they don’t think people are equal.



They think the purpose of government is to allocate power and maintain the hierarchy.



3/

<time id="1556420487399346176">[07:22]</time> When a government helps people, they think the government is taking away from the “makers” and giving to the undeserving.



When people lower than them on the hierarchy demand equality, they think those people want to “replace” them.



4/

<time id="1556420839293063169">[07:23]</time> Nineteenth-century America was a strict hierarchy (specifically, a patriarchy) with white men at the top and Black women at the bottom. 



White women were kept out of the professions which kept them dependent on men, which gave men control over them.



5/

<time id="1556421388612685824">[07:25]</time> Nineteenth-century laws reinforced the hierarchy. 



For example, rape laws were designed to protect (white) men from false accusations. They weren't designed to protect women from attack. Rapes were evaluated based on where the victim and attacker were on the hierarchy.



6/

<time id="1556421795120439302">[07:27]</time> I won't go into the details of rape laws, but you get the idea. I'll add, though, that the laws were based on the idea that men were natural aggressors and the woman's job was to guard the good. 



Then along came the Civil Rights and women's rights movements . . . 



7/

<time id="1556422684442894336">[07:30]</time> . . . and the patriarchy was smashed.



We're riding the backlash. 



The current GOP wants to go back to the good old days of the patriarchy.



That's why they want to outlaw abortion, make medicine expensive, and dismantle the regulatory agencies created by the New Deal.



8/

<time id="1556423120138842112">[07:32]</time> If you take a long view of history and consider how long we lived in a patriarchy (from the before start of the nation until the past few decades and we're still not out of it yet) you can see how rapid the changes have been.



The rapid changes have unsettled some people.



9/

<time id="1556423443586768896">[07:34]</time> They really think the liberals are destroying everything good about America. 



(And now I've written my blog post for next weekend so what will I do with my spare time this week?)



10/

<time id="1556424179892703232">[07:36]</time> Precisely: Lots of poor Whites supported the confederacy, which put power into the hands of a very few men (not them). 



But think of it: They had no trouble getting a woman.



Women literally couldn't say no because they had no options. . .

The astounding thing about this very accurate assessment is that the vast majority of those who support the “hierarchy people” are not, and never will be, nor invited to be, among them. https://twitter.com/Teri_Kanefield/status/1556419743552135168

{{% /quoted %}}

<time id="1556425069592645633">[07:40]</time> . . . and if a woman got raped, it was seen as her fault. Even after the Civil War, the rape of a Black woman wasn't seen as a crime.



Men could grab what they wanted and women had no choice but to get married.



12/

<time id="1556428212317474816">[07:52]</time> Someone just said, "My GOP friends don't think this way."



[@TimothyDSnyder](https://twitter.com/TimothyDSnyder/) offers an explanation for how people come to support hierarchal leaders. 



When fairness leaders are in power, they try to create fairness . . . 



13/

<time id="1556428553331175424">[07:54]</time> . . . they do things like try to make sure everyone has healthcare and inexpensive medications.



OK, so if leaders don’t govern in the usual sense (devising policy to better the lives of the citizens) what do they do all day?



14/

<time id="1556429165259214848">[07:56]</time> They create crisis and spectacle! 



GOP members have said that if they come to power, they will impeach Biden and Garland. (Spectacle)



They identify enemies and promise to “neutralize” the enemies. The play on people's fears. 



15/

<time id="1556429702553673728">[07:58]</time> So glad you asked! See my list of things to do. (Link in the next tweet).





Think of history as a push and pull. The liberals and progressives push us forward. The reactionaries and regressives push us backward.

[@Teri_Kanefield](https://twitter.com/Teri_Kanefield/) So with this in mind, how do we move forward?

{{% /quoted %}}

<time id="1556430639309545472">[08:02]</time> Hierarchy people have always been with us. They were in favor of slavery and racial segregation and women in the home.



When we create fairness and equality, they try to roll it back. 



It's constant work. 

https://terikanefield.com/things-to-do/

17/

<time id="1556431258577539072">[08:05]</time> One bit of advice not on my to-do list: Hold on to your ideals.



The hierarchal worldview is deeply cynical. 

The fairness view is idealistic. 



We can never have perfect fairness, so fairness people run the danger of becoming cynical. Positive change requires ideals.



18/

<time id="1556431577638309888">[08:06]</time> So don't get cynical.



Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream.



He probably had a few nightmares as well, but it was his dreams that inspired people to work for a better country.



19/

<time id="1556450683737370624">[09:22]</time> Totally agree. Idealism has to be rooted in reality.



The belief that change can happen all at once is completely unrealistic and leads to cynicism. 



History teaches us that change happens slowly and with great effort because there is always pushback.

[@Teri_Kanefield](https://twitter.com/Teri_Kanefield/) Fantastic thread as usual. May I add one thing? While it’s important to keep our ideals, it’s also important to appreciate small wins. We never move as fast we as we wish, but incremental wins are still victories. Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

<time id="1556680857821143041">[2022-08-09 00:36] </time> I hate to add to this already long thread, but someone responded on Facebook with this ⤵️and it raises an interesting point. 



The founders rejected monarchy and created a rule of law society that rejected autocracy but nonetheless embraced a hierarchy. . .



21/ 

{{< photos 1556680857821143041 >}}

<time id="1556681210146893824">[2022-08-09 00:38] </time> The founders allowed slavery (although not all were in favor of it; Hamilton understood that without that compromise, there would have been no union.)



White women couldn't vote. "We the people" really meant white, well-educated mostly land-owning men.



22/

<time id="1556681857579642881">[2022-08-09 00:40] </time> They created a rule of law government. The laws favored a certain group of people, which is different from a monarchy (see Max Weber's sources of authority for government.)



Our history has been about other groups trying to gain admission to the category of "people."



23/

<time id="1557039752104226816">[2022-08-10 00:22] </time> Adding this here: 

Hierarchy people see law enforcement as a way to allocate and maintain their own power.



They use law enforcement in that way so they (cynically) assume everyone does.



Fairness people see law enforcement as a way to create justice.



24/

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/LennyLLM/status/1557036197012291591/" label="LennyLLM's tweet" %}}

[@Teri_Kanefield](https://twitter.com/Teri_Kanefield/) With all the anguish &amp; crying on the Republican side over the search @ Mar-a-Lago yesterday &amp; the contrast w/ "but her emails," its' probably time for you to do another thread on how the authoritarians see laws &amp; rules as means of control of the "others."

{{% /quoted %}}

<time id="1557040064508481537">[2022-08-10 00:24] </time> Because hierarchy people don't believe in fairness or equality, they don't believe law enforcement has a just use. 



That's why the Republican slogan of "law and order" didn't really mean law and order. It meant "put Black men in jail."
