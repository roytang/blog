ADVENTURER: Dragon! We are here for your gold! Prepare to die!

DRAGON: This gold?

ADVENTURER: We climbed this great mountain, swam it's flooded caverns and-

DRAGON: Fair enough

ADVENTURER: What?

DRAGON: It's yours

ADVENTURER:

DRAGON: How are you carrying it?

ADVENTURER: Um... /1

Let's have a fun topic and talk about GOLD(!) or more specifically why medieval and fantasy settings which use 'gold' as the main currency are pretty much bonkers.



And also what a more grounded currency system might look like!  1/

<time id="1557390480928817154">[23:36]</time> ADVENTURER: I don't get what you mean.

DRAGON: I am literally telling you to take my gold

ADVENTURER: Thanks

DRAGON: Just curious how you're getting it out of here.

ADVENTURER: Right. Well...

DRAGON:

ADVENTURER: We have bags?

DRAGON: Those little leather ones?

ADVENTURER: Yes?

<time id="1557390482795368460">[23:36]</time> DRAGON: So you're fitting my WHOLE hoard of gold coins into those little bags?

ADVENTURER: When you put it that way...

DRAGON: Are they magic bags?

ADVENTURER: No.

DRAGON: Shame.

ADVENTURER #2: Gary i TOLD you we needed to listen to that lady in the laundrette

GARY: Shut up Clive

<time id="1557390484737343491">[23:36]</time> CLIVE: This is EXACTLY what that Paladin in there kept talking about. Logistics.

GARY: Dude not in front of the dragon

DRAGON: oh don't mind me

CLIVE: We've never even SEEN a gold coin before this. She warned us they'd be large and heavy.

GARY: Look, we just need to improvise.

<time id="1557390486566043655">[23:36]</time> GARY: We have pockets, too.

DRAGON: Pockets

GARY: We stuff coins in our pockets. We have pockets

BATTLE MAIDEN: Some of you do

GARY: You don't have pockets Tiffany?

TIFFANY: I'm wearing a fucking metal bikini, Gary

GARY: It's tradition!

TIFFANY: Its up my arse crack is what it is

<time id="1557390488365371393">[23:36]</time> GARY: Look. I accept it's less than ideal. But between our bags and our pockets

TIFFANY: YOUR pockets

GARY: Yes you made your point Tiffany. Look it's still a fortune, in real terms.

CLIVE: But not all of it

DRAGON: I have a suggestion

GARY: What?

DRAGON: Have you heard of NFHs?

<time id="1557390490076594182">[23:36]</time> GARY: Whats an NFH?

DRAGON: So you see that painting over there? The painting of my gold coin hoard?

GARY: Yes

DRAGON: It's the only painting of my hoard in the world

GARY: Okay...

DRAGON: So if you think about it, it IS my hoard

TIFFANY: Gary I'm not sure...

GARY: I'm listening

<time id="1557390491813019648">[23:36]</time> DRAGON: So if you take that painting, which I can give you for a small admin fee of... Oh... 2 silvers, you're taking my hoard.

TIFFANY: Gary...

DRAGON: Trust me Gary. It's a Non-Fungeable Hoard.

<time id="1557390493801136133">[23:36]</time> CLIVE: Can we just take a bit of the hoard as well as this non-fudgeyball-

DRAGON: Non Fungible Hoard

CLIVE: Yeah that

DRAGON: Ha! I mean you COULD but  smart adventurers wouldn't, would they Gary? It would devalue the NFH

GARY: It would? I mean it would

DRAGON: See, Gary gets it

<time id="1557390495948619777">[23:36]</time> TIFFANY: This is so fucking stupid

GARY: Say we do this. Can we trade it for actual gold?

DRAGON: Oh yeah. At any NFH exchange. It's the future.

TIFFANY: Gary when have you seen an NFH exchange

GARY: Well...

DRAGON: OR hold it. NFH value is climbing.

GARY:

DRAGON: The FUTURE Gary

<time id="1557390497936711680">[23:36]</time> &lt;an hour later&gt;



DRAGON: Do you ALWAYS have to smoke those cheap cigars? They're murder on my nose

THE DIVINE OF REGRET &lt;emerging from the shadows&gt;: Non Fungible Hoards?

DRAGON: Benny, I'm an old lady

BENNY: Babe you don't look a day older than 3000

DRAGON: Oh shush you

<time id="1557390499757146112">[23:36]</time> BENNY: You could have just eaten them

DRAGON: The armour is murder on the teeth, darling. This is far more fun. And I made some silvers. There's a lovely little goblin boy in the lower caverns that does those paintings for me for two coppers a time. He's saving for art school.

<time id="1557390501535531008">[23:36]</time> THE DIVINE OF REGRET: Well see you later babe

DRAGON: Oh Benny! So soon?

BENNY: Duty demands I be present when they try and cash in that NFH

DRAGON: Ta ta then. Oh and Benny? Try and make sure that Tiffany girl ends up at Empathy's launderette. I liked her.

BENNY: Will do

"Please do not put Goblins in the dryers"



You've just finished pinning the notice to the wall when the door opens. A ghost seemingly enters the launderette, all flappy and arm-wavy.



You sigh. There's a +1 crossbow under the counter for moments like this. #pollYourOwnAdventure
