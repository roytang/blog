üßµMeet Maria Adela Kuhfeldt Rivera, widow, jeweller, and socialite. The love child of a German father and a Peruvian mother, born in Callao, Peru, and abandoned in Moscow by her mother during the 1980 Olympic Games. 

{{< photos 1563060250269589505 >}}

<time id="1563060605489070086">[15:07]</time> As she would tell her friends as an adult, she was raised by a Soviet couple her mother had befriended shortly before abandoning her. The couple treated Maria Adela badly, leading to Maria Adela seeking a better life abroad.

<time id="1563060830123741187">[15:08]</time> Between 2009 and 2011 she lived and studied in Western Europe, befriending people such as Marcelle D‚ÄôArgy Smith, former editor of the UK edition of Cosmopolitan magazine, whom she met over drinks in Malta in the summer of 2010.

<time id="1563061122621919234">[15:09]</time> Maria Adela lived in Malta with her then boyfriend, but at some point moved to Ostia, near Rome, to take classes in gemology. She later moved to Paris and registered her own jewellery trademark in France under the brand Serein. https://marques.expert/kuhfeldt-rivera-maria-adela/serein-3956249.html

<time id="1563061387479306240">[15:10]</time> In July 2012, Maria Adela married a man who she told friends was an Italian, but tragedy struck when he died in Moscow on 13 July 2013 aged 30, the cause of death recorded in the death certificate as ‚Äúdouble pneumonia and systemic Lupus‚Äù.

<time id="1563061660159315968">[15:11]</time> Maria Adela was not one to be kept down by life‚Äôs twists and turns, and soon moved to Naples in Italy, where she opened the Serein boutique jewellery store, building a reputation in Naples society as a trendy jewellery designer and socialite. 

{{< photos 1563061660159315968 >}}

<time id="1563061914598379520">[15:12]</time> Maria Adela didn‚Äôt just limit herself to the Naples in crowd, but expanded her interests to become the secretary of a local charitable organisation - the Lions Club Napoli Monte Nuovo. 

{{< photos 1563061914598379520 >}}

<time id="1563062080806469636">[15:13]</time> This was not just a regular branch of the Lions Club, an organisation that spans the globe and which generally looks to better the communities it operates in and advance civic society. It had been established by Naples-based NATO officers. 

{{< photos 1563062080806469636 >}}

<time id="1563062242190721024">[15:14]</time> Maria Adela attended many social events, befriending a number of NATO officers, inviting them to her exclusive jewellery store and even starting relationships with a number of them. 

{{< photos 1563062242190721024 >}}

<time id="1563062564560699392">[15:15]</time> Recollections from Ms. D‚ÄôArgy Smith and social media postings on Maria Adela‚Äôs Facebook, as well as on that of her company, show that as of 2013 she regularly travelled to Bahrain, attending an annual luxury goods and jewellery expo, Jewellery Arabia. 

{{< photos 1563062564560699392 >}}

<time id="1563062675676217344">[15:15]</time> In December 2014, her company‚Äôs FB account posted a photo in which she can be seen seemingly gifting Serein cufflinks to the country‚Äôs then prime minister, Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa. 

{{< photos 1563062675676217344 >}}

<time id="1563062821964767233">[15:16]</time> Suddenly, in September 2018, her social life evaporated, and she left Italy with her beloved cat, Luisa. Her friends were mystified at her sudden disappearance, but two months after her departure she posted on Facebook a message suggesting she was recovering from cancer. 

{{< photos 1563062821964767233 >}}

<time id="1563062983000875008">[15:17]</time> But there was something else very special about September 2018. Three minutes before midnight on 14 September 2018, the phone of Maj. General Averyanov, the commander of GRU‚Äôs clandestine operations unit 29155 began to ring. 

{{< video width="320" height="362" src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbEdfstXEAA3mDL.mp4" >}}

<time id="1563063070519590914">[15:17]</time> Earlier that day, Bellingcat and The Insider, had published an investigation into the cover identities of ‚ÄúRuslan Boshirov‚Äù and ‚ÄúAlexander Petrov‚Äù, two undercover GRU spies implicated in the Novichok poisoning of Sergey and Yuia Skripal. https://www.bellingcat.com/news/uk-and-europe/2018/09/14/skripal-poisoning-suspects-passport-data-shows-link-security-services/

<time id="1563063233753546753">[15:18]</time> The investigation had blown the lid on a glaring hole in the GRU‚Äôs tradecraft: for nearly a decade, the GRU had furnished their spies with consecutively numbered passports, allowing investigative journalists to uncover other spies by simply tracing such batches of numbers. 

{{< video width="320" height="178" src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbEduQEX0AASzPV.mp4" >}}

<time id="1563063431468503040">[15:18]</time> Following the publication, Averyanov had received several phone calls from his top boss ‚Äì the GRU‚Äôs chief Igor Kostyukov. Averyanov himself had reached out to many of his subordinates who had been travelling on such passports. 

{{< video width="320" height="179" src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbEd5fTX0AAz6bF.mp4" >}}

<time id="1563063694740729857">[15:19]</time> The midnight caller was the head of GRU‚Äôs Department 5, or the so-called Illegals program ‚Äì a little-known department that planted military spies around the world under false identities. The two GRU officers talked for just over two minutes. 

{{< video width="320" height="176" src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbEeJIWXgAAG_CM.mp4" >}}

<time id="1563063886932193282">[15:20]</time> The next day,  Maria Adela Kuhfeldt Rivera bought a one-way ticket from Naples, Italy, to Moscow, flying on a passport from one of the number ranges Bellingcat had outed the previous day. 

{{< video width="320" height="178" src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbEeUUBWAAE_Bj0.mp4" >}}

<time id="1563064042494648321">[15:21]</time> The widowed jewellery designed socialite who had become part of Naples social scene, befriending and starting relationships with NATO officers serving at the nearby NATO base was in fact a deep cover GRU operative. 

{{< video width="320" height="320" src="https://video.twimg.com/tweet_video/FbEedF7WAAATC4V.mp4" >}}

<time id="1563064156743700480">[15:21]</time> Bellingcat and partners have now identified her real identify as Russian citizen Olga Kolobova, born in 1982, now living in Moscow in a high end apartment 

https://www.bellingcat.com/news/2022/08/25/socialite-widow-jeweller-spy-how-a-gru-agent-charmed-her-way-into-nato-circles-in-italy/

<time id="1563064301492920320">[15:22]</time> It took months to uncover the real identity of ‚ÄúMaria Adela‚Äù, and as is often the case in these investigations the final piece of evidence was almost absurd; Olga‚Äôs WhatsApp profile used the same photo as Maria Adela‚Äôs Facebook profile. #opsec

<time id="1563064536462020610">[15:23]</time> Read the Der Spiegel version (in German) here: https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/hacker-spione-killer-wie-wladimir-putins-agenten-deutschland-unterwandern-a-7b133a17-ec0b-4dcd-981e-f28fc0b9ef56

<time id="1563064604644614144">[15:23]</time> Read La Repubblica‚Äôs story (in Italian) here:

<time id="1563080443540680704">[16:26]</time> I forgot my favourite part of the story, where she appears to have got her "exclusive" jewellery range from Ali Express vendors.

<time id="1563239430743175171">[2022-08-27 02:58] </time> Christo Grozev is currently tweeting about some of the other little details that didn't make it into the final report, and how we found her in the first place

I can't add much to this crazy story than what [@EliotHiggins](https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins/) and [@AricToler](https://twitter.com/AricToler/) already posted. However, I'll answer a few questions on how we actually stumbled on this spy in the first place, and what different tricks we used over 10 months to find her real identity. https://twitter.com/EliotHiggins/status/1563060250269589505

<time id="1563241899104038912">[2022-08-27 03:08] </time> The Russian Embassy in Italy responds to our investigation with a cartoon "If you see Russian 007s everywhere, maybe you read too much la Repubblica." I guess Olga isn't going to get the Maria Butina treatment. Bad luck, Olga, 10 years of your life wasted.
