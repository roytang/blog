Really important thread for Canadians &amp; all to read. I already sorta felt like freezing the truckers' money was bad, but this makes it vividly clear.



If something's illegal, arrest people for it. If it's not but should be, *pass those laws*! No sanctions for things not illegal!

1/ There are no other constitutional rights in substance without freedom to transact



Being meaning to write this for 6 months, but the Canadian response to the trucker protests is illustrating this so vividly, that today is the day.
