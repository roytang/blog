Amazingly written thread that discusses everything from history, military strategy, court politics and drama, to the importance of myth-making and narrative.

Why Russia will lose this war?



Much of the "realist" discourse is about accepting Putin's victory, cuz it's *guaranteed*. But how do we know it is?



I'll argue that analysts 1) overrate Russian army 2) underrate Ukrainian one 3) misunderstand Russian strategy &amp; political goalsðŸ§µ
