Calling Hitler a dictator isn’t negative campaigning. It’s history.



Same goes for Marcos Sr. He was a dictator. He and his family are guilty of plunder, graft, and crimes against humanity - that’s not negative campaigning. It happened about 50 yrs ago, it’s history.

Hindi po negative campaigning ang pagpoint out ng facts about the Marcos family. It's called Philippine History education.
