finally getting to this stunner thanks to a nudge from an old [@adam_tooze](https://twitter.com/adam_tooze/) newsletter. though it's centrally about political economy, right off the bat it strikes me also as something worth any fiction writer's time. wonder if anyone has written about it from that angle.
