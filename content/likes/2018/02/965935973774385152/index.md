Speaking of different socio-economic divergence in a local games scene - last year I visited my home country Malaysia and did a short talk. A group of young Malay boys patiently waited to speak to me and later for a photo with me.



I think about them a lot and here's why: (1/10)

<time id="965935974894141442">[21:07]</time> For the first time in a long time, these boys (late teens or early 20's) called me not by name, but as "Kakak" - the Malay word for older sister. It's a term of endearment used even among strangers, one of the things I love about my country and my mother language.

<time id="965935976085426176">[21:07]</time> They were shy and fidgety. The first thing they did was apologise for not speaking English. I reaffirmed that I'm Malay too and always happy to converse in Bahasa Melayu. In Malaysia, English proficiency is a signifier of competency. On the get go they didn't want to be judged.

<time id="965935977486278656">[21:07]</time> Off the bat they gushed at the fact that I, a Malay, was able to "succeed" as a game dev abroad. Heck, @ahbonk is a national hero for his work as a Lead Designer on FFXV in Japan. Right there, is the validation they look for in public representation.

<time id="965935978790744065">[21:07]</time> Didn't take long until they showed a lot of concern about their own abilities as devs. They struggle with access to software and devkits. Games courses are expensive. Most online programming or art tutorials are in English (or Chinese) - languages they have difficulty with.

<time id="965935979981950979">[21:07]</time> Malaysia's majority are the Muslim-Malays, but the games scene is dominated by the ethnically Chinese Malaysians. Of course, the people I've met are open and friendly - but humans are tribal creatures. It's easy to be singled out if you don't fit with the majority.

<time id="965935981252829184">[21:07]</time> These boys though, they were quite obviously from less well off families. I'm from a privileged socio-economic background that afforded me a tertiary education in the UK. My path doesn't resonate with them. I try to empathise, but ultimately didn't have the answers they wanted.

<time id="965935982456557569">[21:07]</time> The most I could do was be honest - I acknowledged my privileges and their challenges. I praised them for their perseverance. Assured them they *did* have something to bring to the table. Stories and experiences only they can tell through their games. That they belonged.

<time id="965935983593181189">[21:07]</time> There will always be room for new perspectives and new voices. It's a challenge now but I can only hope we're on a trajectory where these barriers outside of race, sexuality and gender are addressed - the fight we have in the West is a different one they have in south-east Asia.

<time id="965935984809570305">[21:07]</time> I don't know if the boys are still at it. If they aren't, I hope they know there's value in trying. It's not a failure to have loved and lost at game dev.
