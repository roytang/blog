So earlier today a young sista on the street uptown started shouting "Leave me alone! You been following me for blocks!" There was a guy walking behind her who suddenly got enraged at her yelling and yelled back, mostly variations on the theme of "Fuck you, bitch"

<time id="1025529412815605761">[07:50]</time> She then shouted, to no one in particular, "I don't know him! He won't leave me alone!"



His reaction confirmed she didn't know him and fam...4 total strangers and myself got in formation in front of her like Bey herself had gotten off the 2 train and commanded it

<time id="1025530135863275520">[07:53]</time> Somebody's stud auntie took the lead and said "You wanna follow people? Come on, try and get through all of us. I dare you."



(She then stepped forward and did the wild b-boy stance and I was so into it but that's not the point rn)

<time id="1025530566110789637">[07:55]</time> I was looking at the young lady, didn't have to even ask #YouOKSis b/c she clearly wasn't.



It seemed like she had been putting up with his street harassment for a few blocks and had finally had enough

<time id="1025531064868057088">[07:57]</time> She and I held eye contact and I don't think I'm imagining that we shared such a common feeling of anger and fatigue in that brief moment. We did a lil' Black Head Nod and she took off quickly around the corner.



MEANWHILE...

<time id="1025531685880954881">[07:59]</time> This man is cursing us out and now kiiiinda stepping forward as if to fight a line of 5 ppl who clearly had time today, but then jumping back when he got close



He probably thought he looked like a boxer. He looked more like a 6 yr old trying to jump double-dutch for the 1st time

<time id="1025532814983352322">[08:04]</time> And then this whole entire grown man started kicking one of those garbage cans they have on some street corners. He yanked some of the trash out and chucked it in our direction, throwing a full-on fit.



I said "Yo don't lash out at your family like that, this isn't their fault"

<time id="1025533241606987782">[08:05]</time> When it was clear that his plan to be a goddammed creep in this moment was foiled, and enough time had passed that the young lady was long gone, he stomped away and we 5 strangers just...disassembled. With not even a word.

<time id="1025533977032093696">[08:08]</time> Each instance of SH requires its own evaluation, prioritizing yr safety. But lemme say this: women, femmes, trans sisters, nonbinary luvs &amp; those of us who experience it so often,



Sometimes the thing to do is make a scene. You don't owe a stranger politeness if you feel unsafeðŸ’›
