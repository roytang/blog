This little @Glitch app  makes a list of the websites for all the accounts you follow on Twitter, and puts them in a format so you can read all of those sites in a feedreader. If you're trying to spend less time on Twitter but still want updates from sites, you're all set!

I love feeds and the people I follow on Twitter.



To make it easier to add the websites of the accounts I follow to [@feedly](https://twitter.com/feedly/), I wrote a little tool that looks for feeds in your URLs and puts them in an OPML file.



Try it with your followings: https://opml.glitch.me/
