Oh, I meant Trump. 

Bourdain famously slammed Trump when he was alive. Why would you think I meant Duterte? 



Oh, because I said "dictator?" Or was it the phrase "mean to women?"  



Sorry, I really should be clear next time.  ðŸ¤—

Uh, again. You can't be a real Bourdain fan and support dictators who are verbally mean to women. It's one or the other, sorry.  ðŸ™ƒ
