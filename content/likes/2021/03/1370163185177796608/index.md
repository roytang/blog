Looking to build a writing habit? ‚úçüèº



I've read far too many books on the subject - almost all of them were a waste. üóë üöÆ



But here are the 8 books I recommend to every new writer (that are actually worth your time): üßµüìñ

<time id="1370163187602096128">[08:02]</time> 1/ Atomic Habits by [@JamesClear](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/) 



This book has nothing to do with writing.



But you can use the four principles in this book to build your writing habit:



‚Ä¢¬†Make it obvious

‚Ä¢¬†Make it attractive

‚Ä¢¬†Make it easy

‚Ä¢¬†Make it satisfying

<time id="1370163196053626880">[08:02]</time> 2/ The War of Art by [@SPressfield](https://twitter.com/SPressfield/) 



Writing is a daily battle with the Resistance.



But until you're aware of it, the Resistance will dominate you.



This book single-handled changed my life.



Here are my takeaways üëáüèº

<time id="1370163198305918977">[08:02]</time> 3/ Show Your Work by [@austinkleon](https://twitter.com/austinkleon/) 



The idea of the writer slaving away for months in solitude is no longer true.



The best writers are sharing all of their ideas in public, getting feedback, and iterating.



To tighten your feedback loops, start sharing.

<time id="1370163200709263364">[08:02]</time> 4/ The Creative Habit by Twyla Twarp



Three great takeaways from this book:



‚Ä¢¬†Have a daily writing ritual

‚Ä¢¬†Keep your writing organized 

‚Ä¢¬†Always stop in the middle to make it easy to pick up later

<time id="1370163207915122691">[08:02]</time> 5/ The Art and Business of Online Writing by [@Nicolascole77](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77/) 



Simply a masterclass in capturing and keeping attention online.



This book leads to more ü§Øü§Øü§Ø feelings than any other book out there.

<time id="1370163210339377154">[08:02]</time> 6/ On Writing by Stephen King



‚ÄúIf possible, there should be no telephone in your writing room, certainly no TV or videogames for you to fool around with. If there‚Äôs a window, draw the curtains or pull down the shades unless it looks out at a blank wall."

<time id="1370163217113157632">[08:02]</time> 7/ On Writing Well by William Zinsser



"Clear thinking becomes clear writing; one can‚Äôt exist without the other."



"The reader is someone with an attention span of about 30 seconds‚Äî a person assailed by many forces competing for attention. "



https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548?dchild=1&keywords=on+writing&qid=1615054208&s=books&sr=1-4&linkCode=sl1&tag=dickiebush04-20&linkId=34f72f55f3150b407b2945cd783ca79b&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl

<time id="1370163219831083011">[08:02]</time> 8/ Elements of Style by Shrunk and White



The reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; he wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express a negative in positive form.



not honest -&gt; dishonest



not important -&gt; trifling

<time id="1370163222083407880">[08:02]</time> 9/ Reading is great, but writing is better.



Reading books on writing feel good, but can quickly turn into procrastination disguised as research.



Start writing every day. Read these books only when you need to.
