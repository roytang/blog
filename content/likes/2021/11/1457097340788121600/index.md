The House of Faberge made 52 "Imperial" eggs as Easter gifts for Tsars Alexander III and Nicholas II to give to their wives and moms. 46 of these survive. I will rank all 46 Imperial Faberge eggs.

<time id="1457097344864997376">[05:27]</time> 46. Colonnade Egg. This is not an egg. Disqualified. 

{{< photos 1457097344864997376 >}}

<time id="1457097346634993675">[05:27]</time> 45. Order of St. George Egg. Boring. 

{{< photos 1457097346634993675 >}}

<time id="1457097348564271106">[05:27]</time> 44. Caucasus Egg. Las Vegas poker chip-ass looking egg. Ugly. 

{{< photos 1457097348564271106 >}}

<time id="1457097350514675719">[05:27]</time> 43. Fifteenth Anniversary Egg. If my partner got me this entirely uninspired egg for our fifteenth anniversary I would be upset. 

{{< photos 1457097350514675719 >}}

<time id="1457097356260818946">[05:27]</time> 42. Tsarevich Egg. Getting better, but pales in comparison to some of the other blue-and-gold eggs, like the Twelve Monograms Egg. 

{{< photos 1457097356260818946 >}}

<time id="1457097362212536322">[05:27]</time> 41. Napoleonic Egg. The green is a little gaudy for my tastes. The border pattern is nice. 

{{< photos 1457097362212536322 >}}

<time id="1457097364066512897">[05:27]</time> 40. Blue Serpent Clock Egg. Not bad, but subtracting points for not having a "surprise" within as most eggs do. Just a clock. The serpent below is easy to miss, IMHO. 

{{< photos 1457097364066512897 >}}

<time id="1457097366633426944">[05:27]</time> 39. Clover Leaf Egg. The colors of this egg are so hideous I begrudgingly respect it. It looks like it spoiled. 

{{< photos 1457097366633426944 >}}

<time id="1457097371582599170">[05:27]</time> 38. Rock Crystal Egg. One of a handful of eggs owned by the Va Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond and one of several clear eggs that let you look inside. Of all the clear eggs, this has the lamest surprise. The pictures rotate, though. 

{{< photos 1457097371582599170 >}}

<time id="1457097377244921857">[05:27]</time> 37. Alexander III Equestrian Egg. Compare to the Rock Crystal Egg: the surprise is much cooler and the engraving on the egg itself is a nice touch. 

{{< photos 1457097377244921857 >}}

<time id="1457097381707718657">[05:27]</time> 36: Steel Military Egg. This egg looks like Dr. Robotnik. 

{{< photos 1457097381707718657 >}}

<time id="1457097386992488450">[05:27]</time> 35. Alexander Palace Egg. The model of the Alexander Palace inside is neat, but not nearly as cool as the Gatchina Palace Egg. 

{{< photos 1457097386992488450 >}}

<time id="1457097393313288195">[05:27]</time> 34. Cradle with Garlands Egg. A really lovely blue color you don't see on any of the other eggs. The surprise, a miniature of the Romanov children, is missing, which is a little on the nose. 

{{< photos 1457097393313288195 >}}

<time id="1457097398673678342">[05:27]</time> 33. Moscow Kremlin Egg. What the fuck. This might be the worst egg, but it might also be the best. Looks like Baba Yaga lives in it or something. You have to respect it. 

{{< photos 1457097398673678342 >}}

<time id="1457097403916558342">[05:27]</time> 32. Rosebud Egg. Like a more elegant and understated version of the Caucasus Egg. Points subtracted because the "rosebud" surprise is clearly a lemon. 

{{< photos 1457097403916558342 >}}

<time id="1457097409868275722">[05:27]</time> 31. Catherine the Great Egg. Also known as the "Grisaille Egg" for the all-gray paintings in the cameo. Pretty decent. 

{{< photos 1457097409868275722 >}}

<time id="1457097415400599555">[05:27]</time> 30. Pansy Egg. I really like the color of this egg, which is sometimes known as the "Spinach Jade Egg." One of the more understated eggs, which I like. 

{{< photos 1457097415400599555 >}}

<time id="1457097419896860674">[05:27]</time> 29. Peter the Great Egg. Also in Richmond. Sure. 

{{< photos 1457097419896860674 >}}

<time id="1457097425810767879">[05:27]</time> 28. Renaissance Egg. I like the curved lattice on the top of this one. It gets bonus points for being mysterious: the surprise is lost, but some people think the Resurrection Egg, a totally different egg, is actually the surprise once contained within. 

{{< photos 1457097425810767879 >}}

<time id="1457097431515082755">[05:27]</time> 27. Romanov Tercentenary Egg. I wasn't into this egg until I saw the surprise: a big rotating blue-and-gold globe of the Russian Empire. 

{{< photos 1457097431515082755 >}}

<time id="1457097436581740547">[05:27]</time> 26. First Hen Egg. As you can tell from its simplicity, this was the very first egg, so it gets points for being the OG. But I sort of love the purity of it, and the very charming golden hen inside the golden yolk. 

{{< photos 1457097436581740547 >}}

<time id="1457097443108134916">[05:27]</time> 25. Standard Yacht Egg. One of the better clear eggs. The lapis lazuli eagles and snakes really elevate it. Now they're getting good. 

{{< photos 1457097443108134916 >}}

<time id="1457097449592475660">[05:27]</time> 24. Basket of Flowers Egg. I love the intricacy of the flowers on this one, but I don't like it as much as some of other flower-based eggs, which do the same thing a little bit better. 

{{< photos 1457097449592475660 >}}

<time id="1457097456995508224">[05:27]</time> 23. Peacock Egg. Hell yeah. This is the best of the clear eggs (not including the frosted Winter Egg). Look at the color on that little guy. He looks so confident. 

{{< photos 1457097456995508224 >}}

<time id="1457105606737899525">[06:00]</time> 22. Gatchina Palace Egg. The egg itself is no great shakes but imagine opening this to find this gold replica of the Gatchina Palace. This is much better than the Alexander Palace Egg. 

{{< photos 1457105606737899525 >}}

<time id="1457105611708043266">[06:00]</time> 21. Imperial Coronation Egg. This is probably the most famous egg, and while it's not my favorite, I like the lemon yellow color and the intricate coach surprise. 

{{< photos 1457105611708043266 >}}

<time id="1457105615956893696">[06:00]</time> 20. The subtle periwinkle (?) color on this one's really good, and I like the stylized swan. She's got a little pond to sit on, which is a great touch. 

{{< photos 1457105615956893696 >}}

<time id="1457105617651441667">[06:00]</time> 19. Empire Nephrite Egg. This is one of the more visually impressive eggs, and I really love the design along the base. I took points off because most of what makes it cool isn't really the egg itself (or its surprise). 

{{< photos 1457105617651441667 >}}

<time id="1457105621367595012">[06:00]</time> 18. Red Cross with Portraits Egg. One of two "Red Cross" eggs I had trouble ranking. I love the Art Deco-style design on this one but the flatness of it leaves it looking a little cheap. 

{{< photos 1457105621367595012 >}}

<time id="1457105625868087308">[06:00]</time> 17. Red Cross with Triptych Egg. I give this one the nod over the Red Cross with Portraits Egg because of the subtle texture on the egg itself. Grand Duchess Tatiana looks like somebody's Twitter icon. 

{{< photos 1457105625868087308 >}}

<time id="1457105630565699591">[06:00]</time> 16. Twelve Monograms Egg. This one really works. It's busy without being overdone or gaudy and the colors are great. 

{{< photos 1457105630565699591 >}}

<time id="1457105634994819075">[06:00]</time> 15. Rose Trellis Egg. This is what the Clover Leaf Egg should have been. I think it does a great job of combining orderly and natural forms, like a real rose garden might. 

{{< photos 1457105634994819075 >}}

<time id="1457105638748823555">[06:00]</time> 14. Third Imperial Egg. Reminds me of the Rocketeer. 

{{< photos 1457105638748823555 >}}

<time id="1457105644897644550">[06:00]</time> 13. Cockerel Egg. The little chicken pops out and he's cute as fuck 

{{< photos 1457105644897644550 >}}

<time id="1457105649893060619">[06:00]</time> 12. Mosaic Egg. The mosaic gives the impression of the Byzantine Empire, or maybe a pixelated video game. Really unique. 

{{< photos 1457105649893060619 >}}

<time id="1457105654737510403">[06:00]</time> 11. Danish Palaces Egg. Is this too high? I like the pinkish color with the golden sheen. I bet this really pops IRL. 

{{< photos 1457105654737510403 >}}

<time id="1457105659942551552">[06:00]</time> 10. Lilies of the Valley Egg. One of two Art Nouveau eggs (the other is the Pansy Egg). The pearls as lilies are very clever and I like how they droop a little. Definitely a top ten egg. 

{{< photos 1457105659942551552 >}}

<time id="1457105666167001089">[06:00]</time> 9. Constellation Egg. This egg was never finished because of the revolution and all, which is too bad, because holy shit, look at it. The crystal cloud? The engraving in the blue glass? Amazing how different it is from the earlier neo-classical eggs. 

{{< photos 1457105666167001089 >}}

<time id="1457105670721921031">[06:00]</time> 8. Pelican Egg. Pelicans are cool, and the egg is pure engraved gold with no enameling. It looks sharp as hell. 

{{< photos 1457105670721921031 >}}

<time id="1457105672894656516">[06:00]</time> 7. Bouquet of Lilies Egg. Compare this to the "Basket of Flowers" Egg and you can see how much better this one is, with its gold panels contrasting the onyx lilies. 

{{< photos 1457105672894656516 >}}

<time id="1457105675029565451">[06:00]</time> 6. Karelian Birch Egg. OK, this one is cool: because of WWI austerity measures, they made this one out of birch panels, but the result is one of the most dignified eggs. "This is the egg of a carpenter" 

{{< photos 1457105675029565451 >}}

<time id="1457105679928397828">[06:00]</time> 5. Trans Siberian Railway Egg. Choo choo! 

{{< photos 1457105679928397828 >}}

<time id="1457105686240894976">[06:00]</time> 4. Bay Tree Egg. One of my very favorites and by far the best use of natural greenery. There's not really an egg here, but the suggestion of an egg made by the clustered leaves. A little clockwork songbird comes out of the top. 

{{< photos 1457105686240894976 >}}

<time id="1457105691328618501">[06:00]</time> 3. Diamond Trellis Egg. Maybe a controversial choice but I like the modern simplicity of this egg, and it has an elephant inside that really walks. 

{{< photos 1457105691328618501 >}}

<time id="1457105696848293891">[06:00]</time> 2. Memory of Azov. The velvet interior... the ship that looks like it's rocking on the waves... 

{{< photos 1457105696848293891 >}}

<time id="1457105701399052291">[06:00]</time> 1. Winter Egg. This egg really has it all: the frosted snowflakes on the glass, the modernist ice crag with dripping veins of frost, the wood anemones inside that suggest the melting of winter ice and the coming of spring. This is the #1 egg. 

{{< photos 1457105701399052291 >}}
