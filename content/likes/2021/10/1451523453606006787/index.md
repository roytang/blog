Wouldn't be prescriptive about it—this isn't a list of 'shoulds'—but some game mechanics I'd consider 'relatable' to people who identify as Pinoy:



~ utang ng loob (as a social resource similar to bonds in PBtA, or a narrative duty similar to giri in L5R or The Veil)



[1/?]

We tend to be so informed by white/American standards of storytelling and design that we run the risk of applying that lens to everything. I'm curious: in your local context, what are the elements of a good story? What should a game, or movie, or story have for it to work? (1/3)

<time id="1451523457427017729">[20:18]</time> ~ pakikisama (invoked, as in FATE, when group affiliation conflicts w/ personal goals; may be based on family, clan, peer group/barkada/tropa/crew)



[2/?]

<time id="1451523459641536517">[20:18]</time> ~ panganay (treated like a 'background' or 'template' that requires a character to prioritize their parents', siblings' or household's welfare ahead of their personal goals; doesn't have to be a *literal* eldest/first-born)



[3/?]

<time id="1451523461772288000">[20:18]</time> ~ labas/loob (set unspoken but well-understood divisions between insiders and outsiders; take a penalty when *opposing* another insider unless you have a leadership role; get a bonus when *opposing* outsiders)



[4/?]

<time id="1451523464146292736">[20:18]</time> ~ palusot or diskarte (as a Skill in itself or an Attribute that modifies checks when using craftiness or devious means to avoid, ignore, or 'work around' official rules)



[5/?]

<time id="1451534596919595016">[21:03]</time> ~ barkada (PCs or NPCs labeled as kabarkada are treated like chosen family; add their social resources to a barkada pool; you're tacitly expected to make time for them during crises and share celebrations with them; *may* involve buying gear for them from your personal GP) [6/?]

<time id="1451535526482169857">[21:06]</time> ~ tamad/"pwede na yan" (complacency - treated as a disadvantage/drawback/negative trait; when invoked during a skill test, roll twice; if both rolls pass, take the lower one, even for a crit success)



[7/?]

<time id="1451539200948387844">[21:21]</time> Tangentially related: this thread eventually discusses why fans/consumers/viewers/gamers in the global south may opt to defend the appeal of Crit Role + Bon Appetit Test Kitchen, even as those shows either ignore or gloss over our everyday social milieu.

Not a huge Critter, nor did I ever follow the @/bonappetit Test Kitchen. But I wonder if it's useful comparing them (re: labor practices, outsized cultural influence, lucrative niche, fraught relation to trad print media). Do Crit Role diehards' fear it will end up like BA v1.0?

<time id="1451555391389659140">[22:25]</time> ~ "Bahala na!" (leave it up to chance - treated as a negative trait/drawback/disadvantage; invoked when testing a skill that you're not trained/proficient in; use dice one size smaller - d12 to d8, d8 to d6, up to a minimum of d4; works best for SWADE type rules  



[8/?]

<time id="1451557295003897858">[22:33]</time> ~ "Bilog ang mundo!" (karma; neutral trait)



invoked by GM when PC defeats a lower-level enemy; the next opponent of the same type has advantage vs. you



invoked by PC when defeated by a higher-level enemy; you roll with advantage vs. the next opponent of the same type
