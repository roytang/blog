A thread on the [@foodpandaPH](https://twitter.com/foodpandaPH/) riders who rallied in Davao City last week, and how the popular app came after them:



Foodpanda slapped a 10-yr suspension on around 100 riders last week. It then gave some riders their jobs back — in exchange for info about the leaders of the protest

<time id="1416922169443971072">[08:45]</time> Foodpanda slapped a 10-yr suspension on about 30 of its riders in Davao City last week, a day before they were set to stay offline to protest against the app’s wage policy. 



When hundreds of riders rallied in response, another 70 who participated were also suspended for 10 years

<time id="1416922180122673152">[08:45]</time> But as of Sunday (July 18), the number of suspended accounts dropped to 43, according to Edmund Carillo, president and co-founder of the Davao United Delivery Riders Association Inc., a riders’ group formed last May.



Why? FoodPanda had a “whistleblower’s program.”

<time id="1416922182865674240">[08:45]</time> “What happened was [some of the] accounts were brought back. This is what happens when a rider goes to their office. They’ll give you back your access to the app if you snitch on a leader [of the protest],” he told the Inquirer in Filipino in a phone interview on Sunday.

<time id="1416922184300130306">[08:45]</time> It was supposed to be a silent protest, he said. The plan was to stay offline for two days (July 14, and July 15) starting Wednesday, but there was no initial plan to rally. 



He didn’t have an idea how many would join since he left that choice to the riders themselves.

<time id="1416922192009338880">[08:45]</time> He said someone must have tipped the management about the plan. On July 13, he said around 30 of them got suspended even before they could start their silent protest. 



The violation, as Foodpanda explained in its notice, was because they were planning not to show up for work. 

{{< photos 1416922192009338880 >}}

<time id="1416922195113123840">[08:45]</time> To gauge how many riders would be on duty at any given time, Carillo said Foodpanda usually asks them commit to a certain schedule in advance. 



But the riders who wanted to join the protest didn’t commit to a schedule on July 14 and 15 at all, he said.

<time id="1416922196472045568">[08:45]</time> The suspension pushed them to the streets. On Thursday, the riders had a rally along Roxas Avenue near the Freedom Park in Davao City. 



He said he was expecting around 100 riders, but he was surprised to find their number grow when other riders saw what they were doing.

<time id="1416922197843537924">[08:45]</time> He estimated around 300 to 400 Foodpanda riders joined them that day.



“The other riders lost access to the app after the rally. Around 6 or 7 pm, there were those who already got removed,” he said in a phone interview on Friday. He said they were suspended for 10 yrs too.

<time id="1416922199252881410">[08:45]</time> Why did these all happen?



The riders just wanted to know how their wages were being computed, since they noticed they have been earning less lately from each delivery. The group even had meetings with a company rep, although he said these didn’t lead to any definite answer.

<time id="1416922205993062400">[08:45]</time> What does its latest freelance agreement say about service fees?



According to a copy seen by Inquirer, the company “reserves the right and has sole discretion to change the service fees at any time.” 



The rider just has to use the app to show their “acceptance of such change.” 

{{< photos 1416922205993062400 >}}

<time id="1416922208224481280">[08:45]</time> Before the latest service fees, Carillo recalled that the app must have changed the way it computed its fees twice. 



When he joined the app in 2018, he said they were paid on a per hour basis, regardless if they were allocated a ride or not.

<time id="1416922209679859714">[08:45]</time> The hourly pay was eventually changed to a no work, no pay system.  This had a flat rate of around P55 per delivery, which all goes to the rider, regardless the distance.



Now, he said they are paid based on the distance of the delivery, but they don’t know the rate per distance.

<time id="1416922211126890497">[08:45]</time> He said he would take home around P29 from each delivery now.



Moreover, he described the measurement as a “ruler system,” which measured the distance between vendor and the customer without considering other factors like the streets that may make the trip farther.

<time id="1416922212624330752">[08:45]</time> “We’re at a loss here because there are customers who pin a wrong location. Our earnings are based on where the customer pinned his or her location. But when we deliver to the pinned location, the customer is actually farther than that,” he said.

<time id="1416922214117511168">[08:45]</time> This is the latest example of the consequences these riders face for not being considered employees by the apps that hire them. 



The distinction between an employee and an independent contractor is important. Only employees get protected by the labor code.

<time id="1416922221256220673">[08:45]</time> Only employees can get at least a minimum wage or a separation pay, among other protections.



Foodpanda does not consider its riders as its employees, a practice seen in other apps like Grab. 



Foodpanda said their rider is an “independent contractor.”

<time id="1416922223604998144">[08:45]</time> DOLE has a way to say whether or not there is an employer-employee relationship. 



It’s called the four-fold test, which looks for the following elements: if the worker was hired, paid with wages, can be dismissed, and if the employer has the power to control the employee.

<time id="1416922225190400003">[08:45]</time> Out of the four elements, it is the last one — also known as the control test —  that is considered most important. In essence, this means the employer has the power to control an employee’s conduct, telling the latter not only what to do in his or her job, but also how to do it.

<time id="1416922226691952643">[08:45]</time> Arnold de Vera, who teaches labor law at the University of the Philippines College of Law, said food delivery riders, including those hired by Foodpanda, meet the four-fold test and therefore should be treated as employees. 



What happened in Davao, he said, only confirmed this.

<time id="1416922228210343941">[08:45]</time> “What they did here only confirms that because only an employer will behave this way,” he said in a phone interview with the Inquirer last Saturday.



“It’s not fair, especially for an infraction that has not yet happened,” he said.

<time id="1416922229753872385">[08:45]</time> “I can’t see any violation. Nothing happened yet. Even if something did, even Foodpanda said you can work according to your own hours and days. You determine how you work. So how can there be a violation if [the riders] were merely exercising that right?” de Vera said.

<time id="1416922231297351683">[08:45]</time> A daily minimum wage is one of the protections under the labor code. 



Assuming the changes in Foodpanda’s wages still fall under the minimum wage, de Vera said the labor law has a principle which essentially means that the benefits an employee receive cannot be reduced over time

<time id="1416922232803057664">[08:46]</time> Called the principle of non-dimunition of benefits, he said this means a rider should either retain his wage or get more, but not less the longer he worked for the company. 



He said DOLE should act on the plight of food delivery riders. “If not, it will just happen again.”

<time id="1416922241426550786">[08:46]</time> The Inquirer asked Foodpanda for its comment on this issue. 



It said the riders were suspended for breaking their agreement, “such as causing disruptions to operations that affect the wider ecosystem of restaurant-partners and customers.”
