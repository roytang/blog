One thing I really love about Desert Golfing / Golf on Mars is how both games *lean into* the infamous "10,000 Bowls of Oatmeal" problem of PCG (see https://galaxykate0.tumblr.com/post/139774965871/so-you-want-to-build-a-generator). Deliberately quiet, slow experience in a vast desert. The physics comedy of tiny landscape details.
