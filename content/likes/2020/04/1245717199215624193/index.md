The movie is about a 60s band with one big hit. Your job is to write that song, knowing be played 11 times over the course of the movie, and has to work every time. Now imagine what it takes to absolutely nail that brief. RIP Adam Schlesinger 1967-2020 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EdOdfCM1hM&feature=youtu.be
