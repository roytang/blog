If you've been a programmer for a few years, there's probably stuff on your computer that you can immediately convert to money or attention.



Examples: ðŸ‘‡

<time id="1232682574113193984">[23:03]</time> 1. Before I left my job, I created a very simple spreadsheet to calculate how long I could live off my savings.



I put the sheet on GitHub and posted it to HN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19294173



15 minutes of work (the sheet already existed) got me hundreds of new followers here.

<time id="1232682575388233728">[23:03]</time> 2. When I was researching product ideas for my business, I had one idea that required precise understanding of EC2's network performance. I open sourced my testing tool along with all the data I collected: https://github.com/dvassallo/s3-benchmark



Today this still gets &gt;600 visits a week.

<time id="1232682576470347776">[23:03]</time> 3. When I was running my EC2 tests, I discovered a weird throttling behavior. I posted my obserations on r/aws: https://www.reddit.com/r/aws/comments/bg5vst/obscure_ec2_network_throttling/



This got picked up by dozens of people in the AWS community. A few minutes of work (a couple of screenshots) got me 1000+ new followers here.

<time id="1232682577774833672">[23:03]</time> 4. When I was building Userbase, I had to set up my AWS environment from scratch. That setup template became a foundation for my ebook on AWS: https://dvassallo.gumroad.com/l/aws-good-parts



About 20 days of additional work resulted in $61K sales so far, and still doing hundreds of dollars every day.

<time id="1232682578928226304">[23:03]</time> Conclusion: Sell your sawdust (stuff you already created as a side-effect). Many times you can sell your sawdust for money (on [@gumroad](https://twitter.com/gumroad/)) or for attention (on [@github](https://twitter.com/github/)) with very little extra effort.
