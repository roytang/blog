So, for various reasons, I'm rereading the HISTORY OF MIDDLE-EARTH books about the writing of Lord of the Rings. They're fascinating (for certain values of fascinating); what I'm going to do this time try to extract writing advice (thread)

<time id="1320701764090421250">[20:20]</time> Tolkien wrote drafts out by hand; he'd make scribbled notes on one draft that might get worked into the next. Most of the drafts were preserved, so we get to trace how the story evolves and changes. Basically, it's the Track Changes of doom.

<time id="1320702089606123521">[20:21]</time> First off - Tolkien sets out to write a sequel to the Hobbit, and he has absolutely no idea what it's about. But the man's a pantser (not a panther, autocorrect), so he just starts writing. And Hobbit nonsense amuses him, so we get a lot of Hobbit nonsense at the start.

<time id="1320702429248315399">[20:22]</time> The basic elements of 'A LONG-EXPECTED PARTY' are there, and some of the dialogue and description survives through many *many* drafts to the final text. Stuff like the fireworks, the various Hobbit families, the speeches. And Bilbo vanishing with the ring.

<time id="1320702804353310728">[20:24]</time> But he has no idea where Bilbo's going or why. There's a vague idea that he's run out of money, or gotten bored with the Shire, but that's about it. Still, Tolkien's already crossed the hardest threshold - he's broken the white page and actually written something.

<time id="1320703206880694273">[20:25]</time> Pretty soon, though, he runs into a problem. The Hobbit ended with "Bilbo lived happily to the end of his days", and obviously, he can't go back and change a published book - that'd be madness. So, either he sticks with Bilbo as his protagonist, or he comes up with a new hero.

<time id="1320703698725720064">[20:27]</time> Enter... Bingo Baggins. 



Bilbo's son and heir. 



Bingo's a sort of proto-Frodo, obviously. At this stage, he's basically Bilbo 2.0, without any real personality. His motivation wobbles between "Adventure" and "Moar Gold" for a bit.

<time id="1320703992956096512">[20:29]</time> So, lesson 2: continuity is important. If you're writing a series, everything has to line up with the previous books, so be careful of voice-of-god pronouncements like "he lived happily ever after".

<time id="1320704757758132224">[20:32]</time> Anyway, Bingo sets off with his faithful companions, Frodo and Odo. They'll become Merry and Pippin eventually, but after about a million name changes. Getting the right name for a character is very important, but you can live with placeholders for a bit.

<time id="1320704999400366081">[20:33]</time> They set off from Bag End for pretty undefined reasons. There's a vague "let's go on an adventure" feel, some muttering about money or the lack thereof, but again, there's absolutely no real hint of a plot at this point.

<time id="1320705347187867649">[20:34]</time> The absolutely pivotal exposition chapter at the beginning, THE SHADOW OF THE PAST, doesn't get inserted for ages. Tolkien's absolutely just spinning his wheels, amusing himself with Hobbitry. He's writing what he likes.

<time id="1320705621855973378">[20:35]</time> About the only idea he has for 'stuff that's going to happen' is 'Tom Bombadil sequence', and even that's him recycling material he wrote earlier (Tom, Old Man Willow, and the Barrow-wight comes from some poetry he wrote years prior).

<time id="1320705728479399937">[20:35]</time> (Also missing: Sam Gamgee. Not present even in embryonic form.)

<time id="1320706509270142976">[20:39]</time> As he's writing and revising, Tolkien realises that yeah, the one dangling plot hook from the Hobbit is the nature of the ring. So, he starts noodling with the idea that the story is going to be about the Ring somehow.

<time id="1320706938896818176">[20:40]</time> He starts making notes and writing fragments that will eventually become THE SHADOW OF THE PAST, but they're not yet integrated into the main story. Still, there's a subtle change of tone by the time Bingo and company run into Gildor and the Elves.

<time id="1320707546278223872">[20:43]</time> Around this point, there's also one of the  most significant significant turning points in the development of the story.

<time id="1320707650925936640">[20:43]</time> The Hobbit are walking along the Road. They hear a horse approaching.  



There's a mysterious rider, hooded and cloaked. 



They hide.



He sniffs.  



Pulls back his hood. It's Gandalf!

<time id="1320708056947281926">[20:45]</time> Tolkien then crosses out the last line. The mysterious sniffing rider transmutes from the Hobbit's friendly wizard pal to a sinister hunter, stalking Bingo across the Shire. As Tolkien puts it, "stories get out of hand, and this has taken an unpremeditated turn."

<time id="1320708390797148160">[20:46]</time> Without that moment, the 'Hobbit sequel' would probably have been exactly that. A sequence of mostly light-hearted escapades and a lot of talk about beer and sandwiches, of a length and piece with the Hobbit.

<time id="1320708568413315074">[20:47]</time> Bolts of inspiration can look like mistakes, and vice versa. Sometimes, you've got to chase a story down what looks like a blind alley.

<time id="1320713911667249153">[21:08]</time> (more later)

<time id="1320780553487003649">[2020-10-27 01:33] </time> It’s fascinating to watch ideas bubble up and be discarded or retained. Is Farmer Maggot a relative of Tom Bombadil?(no) Do the hobbits get ambushed by Black Riders on the way to Rivendell? (Yes, but not in the way Tolkien initially outlines it)

<time id="1320781867914797056">[2020-10-27 01:38] </time> The Bree chapter is a great example of how you can write a sequence and then later on add significance. The actual text comes together quickly in Tolkien’s draft. All the familiar elements are there - Butterbur, letter from Gandalf, silly Song, the use of the Ring, riders lurking

<time id="1320782265174163459">[2020-10-27 01:40] </time> Even Bill Ferny. 



but Saruman hasn’t been invented yet, so Ferny’s a sinister element without any real purpose. It’s only later that Tolkien connects him to a more complex plot.

<time id="1320782993154297856">[2020-10-27 01:42] </time> I do this in games all the time - drop in a shadowy figure, work out who they’re working for later. it can also work in novels, although it can backfire. Novels need to be more coherent and have less space for explanations, so adding random baddies can be counterproductive.

<time id="1320783484831629318">[2020-10-27 01:44] </time> The other huge difference is the mysterious Ranger in the corner of the inn. It’s... Trotter the Hobbit, a tough-as-nails wild hobbit with wooden shoes.

<time id="1320783973140844546">[2020-10-27 01:46] </time> Trotter stays as a hobbit for many chapters before he gets rewritten as a Man. It’s amazing how little text gets changed, though. Sort of freeing, too - I must try making more radical changes in my own drafts and see how it goes.

<time id="1320786966611402752">[2020-10-27 01:58] </time> More writing advice: do not promise your publisher that you’ll submit your new book in early 1939 if it’s going to take another decade to finish.

<time id="1320788093037879296">[2020-10-27 02:03] </time> (And if you do, don’t demand they also publish your giant largely impenetrable epic at the same time, dump them in a fit of pique, and then come back when the other publisher doesn’t play ball.



To get away with that, your sales would have to be... oh)

<time id="1320796575296344065">[2020-10-27 02:36] </time> (Stopping here again for a bit, but come back soon for “Tolkien gives really good advise on revising” and “Tolkien absolutely screws up by tying his hobbits in knots”)

<time id="1320811222569275392">[2020-10-27 03:35] </time> Tolkien's reuse of words and concepts from the Silmarillion is hilarious. On p. 49 of the Hobbit, he mentions Gondolin; on p. 53. the Mines of Moria. 



YOU: Hey JRRT of 1939, what are the Mines of Moria?

JJRT1939: Uh, dunno. Some Dwarf stuff, I guess? Just a name I made up.

<time id="1320812892967653377">[2020-10-27 03:41] </time> YOU: Oh, ok. And Gondolin, a reference you dropped in an equally offhand fashion?

JRRT: *deep breath* 

JRRT: Well Turgon was the second son of Fingolfin son of Finwe,  brother to Fingon who rescued Maedhros from Thangordrim. Now the Vala Ulmo showed Turgon a hidden valley, where-

<time id="1320813378559004672">[2020-10-27 03:43] </time> It's with the name Glorfindel that it really comes back to bite him. Glorfindel (1) was a heroic elf who slew the Captain of the Balrogs at the Fall of Gondolin in the First Age; Tolkien then uses the name for Glorfindel (2) who shows up to help Bingo and Trotter.

<time id="1320814395253993472">[2020-10-27 03:47] </time> What does it mean if two Elves have the same name? Tolkien agonises over this for ages. What's the nature of death for Elves, then? If Glorfindel comes back, why don't other elves? Do Elves reincarnate? Many, many essays and changes of mind later, the answer is 'sorta'.

<time id="1320814693888438273">[2020-10-27 03:48] </time> Said essays are interesting if you're deep into the lore of Middle-earth. From a writing perspective, though, it can be a good idea to remind yourself that you're in charge, and sometimes a simple change can avoid a lot of hangups. Like, say, calling the elf Clive or something.

<time id="1320815262988423173">[2020-10-27 03:51] </time> Anyway, I've got to the point in the book where Tolkien stops for a bit, outlines the next bit, pulls plot threads together, and generally solidifies what he's got so far.



He's already hinted at it, but now he's decided that the Ring is the main plot.

<time id="1320815612814364675">[2020-10-27 03:52] </time> So, he goes back and puts in the Shadow of the Past, and explains the backstory of the Rings and Sauron. It's not all together yet - Minas Tirith hasn't been imagined yet, so the Ring's dropped by a random elf, not Isildur. He's hazy on how many Rings there are, and who has them.

<time id="1320816031292600323">[2020-10-27 03:54] </time> But he has his core story. Get the Ring to the Fire. 



Now as he revises, the Ring becomes more sinister and  important. The Hobbit buddies are now shown to be more aware of the Ring; we get the idea of a 'conspiracy' to support Bingo, as opposed to 'a bunch of Hobbits go hiking'

<time id="1320816098883850240">[2020-10-27 03:54] </time> (The movies dropped this concept, which was a pity.)

<time id="1320816581216264194">[2020-10-27 03:56] </time> His notes for revision add Sam, almost as an afterthought. He resolves to have *fewer* Hobbits. Currently, we've got Bingo (who'll become Frodo), Frodo (who'll become Merry), Odo (who'll become Pippin), and Trotter (&gt;Strider). He's about to add Sam. He decides to get rid of Odo.

<time id="1320817350778781696">[2020-10-27 03:59] </time> In the next few drafts, he totally fucks this up, and it's hilarious. What T. wants is "Frodo and Merry (and maybe Sam, if he keeps the idea of the servant") go on a quest. Drop Odo. But he has lots of Odo-dialogue in his existing drafts. What to do?

<time id="1320817772943867909">[2020-10-27 04:01] </time> So, plan: The first bit of the book is "Hobbits go to Crickhollow". He'll dump Odo there. 



But he also wants there to be a bath and a warm welcome at Crickhollow, so he has another Hobbit there, Olo (who'll become Fatty Bolger).

<time id="1320819075434635264">[2020-10-27 04:06] </time> Then he ends up changing his mind for a bit, and keeps Odo in the party, renaming him Folco and changing Olo to Odo. So, he's almost at the final setup in Lord of the Rings, right?

<time id="1320819712150900737">[2020-10-27 04:08] </time> Now, in Lord of the Rings, Fatty Bolger stays behind at Crickhollow to pretend to be Frodo, and ends up running from the Black Riders. 



Here, though, Tolkien has Gandalf show up and rescue Odo. Gandalf then drags Odo with him while he's being chased by the Nazgul.

<time id="1320820290017001475">[2020-10-27 04:11] </time> Gandalf brings Odo all the way to Rivendell. So, Tolkien's attempts to trim the number of Hobbits down to 3 (proto-Frodo, proto-Merry, proto-Pippin) ends up giving him 6 Hobbits in the Fellowship (Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Sam, Trotter and Odo/Fatty Bolger).

<time id="1320820696138829824">[2020-10-27 04:12] </time> So, obviously, the solution is to not have Gandalf show up at Crickhollow, so he can't be there to rescue Olo and Olo won't tag along to Rivendell. So, where's Gandalf?



He's been imprisoned. 



By who.



"The Giant Treebeard."

<time id="1320821036741545986">[2020-10-27 04:14] </time> There are a bunch of Tolkien's 'the story foreseen' outlines in the History of Middle-Earth books, and virtually all of them have a note about the evil Giant Treebeard, who's totally going to do something mean to our heroes.

<time id="1320821374856945664">[2020-10-27 04:15] </time> He'll capture Frodo. He's the one who captured Gandalf. He's in league with Sauron. Or Saruman. Tolkien's really, really hazy about most of the rest of the story, but if there's one thing he's absolutely sure about, it's that Treebeard's a bad egg.

<time id="1320821867494727684">[2020-10-27 04:17] </time> So, another lesson: don't be beholden to your outlines*. They're a tool, a framework, not a binding restriction. 



(*: assuming we're talking about novels here. Freelance RPG writing, different matter :))

<time id="1320822352201003012">[2020-10-27 04:19] </time> Another good bit of advice Tolkien gives is to reduce anticipation. Often, when writing, you'll have an idea in one scene, but as you go on, you'll discover a later scene uses a more powerful form of the same idea.

<time id="1320822894285492224">[2020-10-27 04:21] </time> For example, Tolkien has some dwarves show up at Bilbo's party with news of Dale. Then, later, he meets Gloin at Rivendell.



He (correctly) suggests to himself that he should cut the first set of dwarves, because it'll make the meeting with Gloin more interesting.

<time id="1320823135374090240">[2020-10-27 04:22] </time> (He doesn't actually make the change, because he later increases the time gap between Bilbo's party and the rest of the action, but the intent is sound.)

<time id="1320823508277100546">[2020-10-27 04:23] </time> There's a different between anticipation and foreshadowing. Anticipation is reducing the impact of a cool concept by having a lesser version of it show up earlier in the book; foreshadowing is hinting at a cool concept that's going to show up.

<time id="1320824303168925696">[2020-10-27 04:27] </time> Another example of paths not taken: at one point, it's suggested that there were a bunch of invisible goblin-wraiths...

<time id="1320836584489603074">[2020-10-27 05:15] </time> So, we're finally at Rivendell! Yay! We've got an uncertain number of Hobbits, but all the expected beats are there. Gandalf. Elrond. "The Sword of the Necromancer" aka the Morghul-knife, and Frodo's healing. Meeting up with Bilbo again, and getting Sting and the mithril-vest.

<time id="1320836990967943173">[2020-10-27 05:17] </time> (The mithril-vest is another tangle of continuity. Bingo/Frodo can't have had the vest at Weathertop, otherwise he couldn't be stabbed. Ergo, Bilbo took it, and Bingo now inherits it. Only it's not a mithril-vest yet, as mithril won't be invented for another few chapters...)

<time id="1320837330513571842">[2020-10-27 05:18] </time> The Council of Elrond introduces some new characters - Glóin and his son Gimli, sundry elves, and Boromir of Ond. 



Ond's a kingdom in the south, near the Fiery Mountain, and it's under assault.

<time id="1320837885910724608">[2020-10-27 05:21] </time> It's striking how many bits of the final book float around for ages before coming to their 'correct' configuration. Right now, the current draft has:

* Trotter the Hobbit

* Rangers as the descendants of Numenor

* The land of Ond

* The One Ring being lost

but they're not connected

<time id="1320838924286205952">[2020-10-27 05:25] </time> Other ideas will never survive. For example, the first hint of what would become 'the Scouring of the Shire' is the idea that a dragon might invade Hobbiton at the end of the book.

<time id="1320840900583501833">[2020-10-27 05:33] </time> Actually, here's a fascinating sample of one of Tolkien's outlines at this point. 

{{< photos 1320840900583501833 >}}

<time id="1320841417422479360">[2020-10-27 05:35] </time> It's all there, and yet it's clear he's only glimpsing it distantly. Whole _books_ take him by surprise - that's basically a synopsis of  the rest of Book II, Book V and VI. No Rohan. No Ithilien. Only a hint of Cirith Ungol.

<time id="1320842416870576128">[2020-10-27 05:39] </time> The Council of Elrond scene is much shorter in the first drafts. The whole hunt for Gollum is missing, and there's much less discussion of what to do with the Ring, or the Ring's history.

<time id="1320842770253230081">[2020-10-27 05:40] </time> Then we get onto the composition of the Fellowship, and it all goes a bit funhouse mirror. The iconic 'Nine Walkers - four hobbits, elf, dwarf, Aragorn, Boromir, Wizard' is so familiar it's hard to imagine another configuration.

<time id="1320843488280403970">[2020-10-27 05:43] </time> But Tolkien considers options like "Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Odo, Trotter, Glorfindel, Gimli."



Or "Gandalf, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Trotter, Boromir".



Or the "ablative Hobbit" setup, where it's just the six Hobbits and Gandalf.

<time id="1320844344224526336">[2020-10-27 05:46] </time> They set off, and the journey up to the Redhorn Pass is pretty much as it is in the book. Tolkien describes Boromir forcing a path through the snow and carrying the hobbits out of danger.

<time id="1320844694302134272">[2020-10-27 05:48] </time> Including Trotter.



Trotter, who'd been portrayed as super-competent up until now, is now overshadowed by Boromir. It's clear that the character needs to change, and so he's transformed into a Man in the next draft.

<time id="1320845083189694464">[2020-10-27 05:49] </time> It's bizarre, comparing the texts. There are passages of description that you'd swear were absolutely designed to suggest Strider's kingly ancestry and heroic stature that were actually written for Trotter, the battle-damaged wild hobbit with the wooden shoes.

<time id="1320845423867842561">[2020-10-27 05:51] </time> The author and the reader perceive almost completely different texts.

<time id="1320846644066340866">[2020-10-27 05:55] </time> Moria, and the hilarious continuity error on the doors. (Immortalised here: http://flyingmoose.org/tolksarc/theories/cannibal.htm)

<time id="1320847334499110919">[2020-10-27 05:58] </time> The Moria-chapters are very close to their final form in first draft, including the fall of Gandalf. Tolkien contemplates removing Gandalf in several outlines, and seems to have always intended he return.

<time id="1320847729967456264">[2020-10-27 06:00] </time> It's Gandalf's nemesis who changes quite a bit. At first, it's going to be a host of orcs on the bridge. Then, a Black Rider. Then he hits on the idea of it being a Balrog (another pull from his Legendarium). 



Later, he even thinks of revising the scene so it's Saruman!

<time id="1320848924467494916">[2020-10-27 06:04] </time> Another writer-y tip: Tolkien often slips from relatively finished prose into sketchy outlines. He'll start off describing, say, the crossing of the mountains in detail, and then on the same page scribble "down to Moria gate. Watcher in Water. Dark. Gollum-eyes?"

<time id="1320849105971781632">[2020-10-27 06:05] </time> He clearly tries to capture his thoughts at the time, so when he comes back to the page he has some idea where he was going.

<time id="1320849367981531137">[2020-10-27 06:06] </time> Anyway, we're here at Balin's tomb, where Tolkien famously stopped for some time, so more tomorrow.
