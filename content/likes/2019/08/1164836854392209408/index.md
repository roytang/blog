I was reading Reign in Hell, an event comic about a civil war among DC Comics’ demon lords, when I found a character who knew “Hell’s most terrible secret.” When it was revealed at the end, I was floored.



“Hell’s most terrible secret is that you can leave whenever you want.”

Tell me a line in a book that changed how you see the world or shifted your understanding of how language can be used or just haunts you for reasons you don’t quite understand and maybe never will. A line that just pops into your mind unbidden, like some weird internal narration.
