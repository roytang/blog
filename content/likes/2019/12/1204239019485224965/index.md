My freelancing friends, some key sentences to add to or subtract from your vocabulary so you don't burn out this 2020! A PSA from experience:

<time id="1204239023390113793">[11:18]</time> â€¢ If a request comes in at the close of the day: "I can get to that in the morning!" 



â€¢ If a request comes in after you've clocked out for the day: (Nothing. Reply to it in the morning. Don't even look at your phone.)



â€¢ Ditto for weekends - get to it on Monday.

<time id="1204239028192604161">[11:18]</time> Instead of "Sure, no problem!" when it is, indeed, a problem: 



â€¢ "I can have this done in (time PLUS PADDING. Bc if you submit early, great. But if life happens and you submit "late", it's not late)"



Or



â€¢ "The earliest I can get this done is x. Does this work for you?"

<time id="1204239031631925249">[11:18]</time> For multiple requests, one on top of the other from the same person all due at the same time and you're drowning and like WAIT



â€¢ "Okay, so right now I'm doing x, y, z, a, b, c. How would you like to prioritize?"

<time id="1204239036849610753">[11:18]</time> (Open invitation to shoot a scenario and I'll try and come up with a friendly yet firm-about-my-boundaries reply)

<time id="1204240440653778944">[11:24]</time> Scope creep: 



â€¢ "Hey client! That sounds great, and I'd love to get on that. Our original project covers (outline your agreement, better if it's in the contract). I can add this in for an additional (amount), and have it done by (date)! Does this work for you?"

<time id="1204240442520260609">[11:24]</time> Or, which I've done: 



â€¢ "I'd love to get everything we originally planned done and dusted first. What do you think about having a Phase 2 for this project? We can add (deliverable) there, and talk about what else we need for Phase 2 once we've finished up here!"

<time id="1204261865062203392">[12:49]</time> If a client says what you did isn't what they asked for when it is, indeed, what they asked for: 



â€¢ Screenshot the original request or reply to it. "Hi! I've done x, y, z like we discussed earlier. Would you like me to edit it to (new request)? I can get that done by (time)!"

<time id="1204280967747104773">[14:05]</time> "What's your rate?"



â€¢ "My rate is x."



(I used to over-explain and even negotiate for them myself!!!! "But if that's too much for you, we can go down to y..."  Don't do it, friends. Sayang pera. ðŸ˜‚)



(Also my least headache clients were the ones who didn't negotiate!)

<time id="1204282021289218048">[14:09]</time> If that's out of their budget, and only if you want to work with them:



â€¢ "No problem, we can work with (budget). For (budget), we can do x, y, and z (cut the deliverables!), so thay you can still (reach one of their goals) by (date)!"

<time id="1204425452724449285">[23:39]</time> I also have an autoresponder set up for emails:



â€¢ "Hi! Thanks for emailing. Just wanted to let you know I got it. Please give me 1-2 days on Mondays to Fridays to respond. Thanks!"



^ Fewer chances of ppl emailing Friday night then freaking out bc I haven't replied by Sunday???

<time id="1204594989365202944">[2019-12-11 10:53] </time> Y O

[@hiddenmikli](https://twitter.com/hiddenmikli/) [@baph0meat](https://twitter.com/baph0meat/) Great advice, saved me a lot of headaches when I started using these guidelines.



Also: include a rush rate in your TOS for clients who decide their shit is important enough to do on the weekend.



When your rate doubles, magically they decide it can wait until Monday after all.

<time id="1204609942574944258">[2019-12-11 11:52] </time> Mom's tip: edit your email signature on your phone and remove any indicators that you're mobile (e.g. "Sent from iPhone"). You don't want to people to start thinking that you can reply to their emails right away all the time anytime because you can do it from your phone!

I now use the 'Schedule send' button on Gmail like there IS a tomorrow. It's fantastic for not forgetting to reply to emails but doing it so it looks like I'm getting to it first thing in the morning so clients don't think I'm on call for them. https://twitter.com/hiddenmikli/status/1204239019485224965

You're not my employee. I'm *your client*. This is your business. You get a say in how you run it. ðŸ˜­ðŸ’¯

The best email signature I've ever seen:



"It is normal for me to take 2 days to read my emails and 2 more days to reflect on the matter and respond calmly. The culture of immediacy and the constant fragmentation of time are not very compatible with the kind of life I lead."
