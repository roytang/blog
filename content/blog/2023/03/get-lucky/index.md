We played *Get Lucky*, which is apparently a card game version of [a board game called Kill Doctor Lucky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_Doctor_Lucky). Fun game, but the way it's designed seems to make it always boil down to attrition in the end. I won the first game of the two we played.

A couple of other games we tried to play:

- *Fight Your Friends*: The ten-year old had been wanting to play this all weekend now that he had more people to play with, as he was thinking it was a group game. Turns out it was a one-vs-one game so he kind of lost interest.
- *The Great Dalmuti*: An old favorite among our playgroup. We managed to finish one round before discovering the deck was actually missing a card, and we quit afterwards.
