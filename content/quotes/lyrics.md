---

 I delight in my pain, and I'm shattered like your promises;

 Though I try to be sane, I'm just shattered like, shattered like your promises...

---

 Is there a line that I could write 

 Sad enough to make you cry? 

---

 How would you know if you won't give me some time

 To see if everything were to work out, you'd be mine

---

 All the things she keeps inside,

 All the things that really matter;

 The face puts on its best disguise,

 And all is well until the heart betrays...

---

 I don't mind spending everyday

 Out on your corner in the pouring rain

 Look for the girl with the broken smile

 Ask her if she wants to stay a while

---

 If you were right and I was wrong

 Why are you the one who's gone

 And I'm still here?

---

 Give me a little credit,

 Have in me a little faith;

 I wanna be with you forever,

 But tomorrow's not too late...

---

 I'll be true, I'll be useful, I'll be cavalier

 I'll be yours my dear, and I'll belong to you

 If you just let me through...

---

 My heart is yours to fill or burst,

 To break or bury, or wear as jewelry,

 Whatever you prefer...

---

 My worst pains are words I cannot say

 Still I will always fight on for you

---

"and through it all you'd watched me go, you never even cared that I needed you..." 

  -- Dan England & John Ford Coley / Who's Lonely Now     

---

But of all these friends and lovers

There is no one compares with you. 

And these memories lose their meaning

When I think of love as something new. 

Though I know I'll never lose affection

For people and things that went before

I know I'll often stop and think about them

In my life, I love you more. 

---

Talk is cheap. Shut up and dance!

---

There's gotta be something that would be worthwhile for me to give to you

We need a connection but you seem to push me far away from you

---

"Wish she knew what she does to my heart

 Every time she turns and walks away..."

---

"I want nothing more than to 

 Sit outside heaven's door

 And listen to you breathing

 It's where I wanna be"

---

Tinatawag kita, sinusuyo kita...

Di mo man marinig, di mo man madama...

O kay tagal din kitang mamahalin...

---

"Kahit na ilang ulit mo akong saktan

 Basta't sa susunod ay wag mo na akong iiwan..."

---

Put your heart in my hands

You'll be safe here

---

I dream ahead to what I hope for

And I turn my back on loving you

How can this love be a good thing

Not knowing what I'm going through

  - Three Doors Down

---

Nakita ko na lahat ito

Pinahihiwatig ng mata mo

  - Mojofly

---

Huwag kang matakot, di mo ba alam

Nandito lang ako, sa iyong tabi

Di kita pababayaan kailanman

  - Eraserheads

---

Never let the sun set on tomorrow

Before the sun rises today

  - Nine Days

---

Kill me a little, kill me a little every day

  - Rivermaya

---

You've got a fast car

Is it fast enough so you can fly away?

We gotta make a decision

Leave tonight or live and die this way?

---

I'm stronger now, stronger now than I was before

There's no way you can hurt me

---

Tanging hiling ko sayo na tuwing umuulan

Maalala mo sanang may nagmamahal sa yo, ako

---

Napapalingon tuwing ika'y dumadaan

Napapangiti hindi ko alam ang dahilan

Alam kung hindi pupuwedeng maging tayo

Pero minsan nagiiba ang ikot ng mundo

---

There's a little black spot on the sun today; That's my soul up there

It's the same old thing as yesterday; That's my soul up there

---

I wanna give you whatever you need

What is it you need? Is it what I need?

I wanna give you whatever you need

What is it you need? Is it within me?

---

I've been dreaming for so long 

To see you smile right back at me 

From where you are 

I've been wishing for so long 

To see you smile right back at me 

Like I'm somebody special 

---

Tell me did the wind sweep you off your feet?

Did you finally get the chance to dance along the light of day?

---

You left a stain on every one of my good days

But I am stronger than you know; I have to let you go

---

Reaching out to you from afar

Across the heavens to where you are

It's like chasing after a shooting star

---

I begged you not to go, 

I begged you, I pleaded;

Claimed you as my only hope,

Watched the floor as you retreated;

---

Every time I see the shelter

Every time I walk away

You're the laughter in my silence

The goal that feeds my day

---

Vindicated, I am selfish, I am wrong;

I am right, I swear I'm right, swear I knew it all along;

---

Isigaw mo sa hangin,

Tumindig at magsilbing

Liwanag sa diliam

---

Sometimes I wonder does she really know

What she does when she makes me feel this way...

---

Wish she knew what she does to my heart

Every time she turns and walks away...

---

Iba na ang iyong ngiti

Iba na ang iyong tingin

Nagbago nang lahat sa iyo...

---

Darating ako, simbilis pa ng hangin

Sa oras na kailangan mo, makaaasa ka sa akin

---

When I see you, I think of all that we've become

And I'm blinded, like I'm staring at the sun

---

Without hope, without pride, little things that seem to weaken us

Without fear, live your lives, let the magic turn your life around

---

I am immortal, I have inside me blood of kings

I have no rival, no man can be my equal, take me to the future of your world

---

Tatlong oras na akong nagpapacute sa yo

Di mo man lang napapansin ang bagong t-shirt ko

---

It's the moment of truth, it's all on the line

This is the place, this is the time

---

You must be swift as the coursing river

With all the force of a great typhoon

With all the strength of a raging fire

Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

---
