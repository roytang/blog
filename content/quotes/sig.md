This is a collection of quotes that I used for my randomly-generated email signature for around 10 years, before most of my mail usage became web-based. A lot of them are song lyrics I like, IM quotes, video game quotes, etc. Many of them are unsourced (I'll correct that someday).

---

Have you ever been in love? Horrible isn&#x27;t it? It makes you so vulnerable. It opens your chest and it opens your heart and it means that someone can get inside you and mess you up. You build up these defenses, you build this whole suit of armor, so that nothing can hurt you, then one stupid person, no different from any other stupid person, wanders into your stupid life. You give them a piece of you. They didn&#x27;t ask for it. They do something dumb one day, like kiss you or smile at you, and then your life isn&#x27;t your own any more. Love takes hostages. It gets inside you. It eats you out and leaves you crying in the darkness, so working its way into your heart. It hurts. Not just in the imagination. not just in the mind. It&#x27;s a soul-hurt, a body-hurt, a real gets-inside-you-and-rips-you-apart pain. I hate love. 

- Neil Gaiman

In my life, I love you more.

The expense of spirit in a waste of shame

Is lust in action; and till action, lust

Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,

Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust;

Enjoyed no sooner but despised straight;

Past reason hunted; and no sooner had,

Past reason hated, as a swallowed bait,

On purpose laid to make the taker mad:

Mad in pursuit, and in possession so;

Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;

A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;

Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.

All this the world well knows; yet none knows well

To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.

- Shakespeare, Sonnet 129
