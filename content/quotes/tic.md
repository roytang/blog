These are quotes (allegedly) made by me, compiled by people I know over the years, supposedly because I am a spout of wisdom (?). (Some of them are just me quoting other things, but the people who compiled this list didn't get the reference.)

There is also [a Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/tangincheek) that randomly tweets one of these per day, if you're into that sort of thing.

### 1

Difficult tasks are like drugs: just say 'No'.

---

### 2

it might have been a terrible plan, but sometimes we need to go through the terrible things to make the nonterrible things better

---

### 3

On learning how to make code readable: &quot;These are things you must 

seek out on your own.&quot;

---

### 4

&quot;I can choose to pass on the bestness&quot;

---

### 5

Let's worry about that in the future 

---

### 6

This is true

---

### 7

Stop quoting me

---

### 8

why are there always problems?

---

### 9

I am an agent of chaos

---

### 10

---

### 14

---

### 15

i do it out of a sense of responsibility

---

### 16

&lt;hunter&gt; I suggest you doublecheck your facts!

&lt;hunter&gt; in fact, trees are plants

---

### 17

this can only end in le disaster

---

### 18

---

### 19

---

### 51

&lt;hunter&gt; it was a traumatizing experience 

---

### 53

may naisip ako... Pag ang janitor ay isang spy, pwede siya 

tawagin na cleaning agent

---

### 72

&lt;hunter&gt; i wouldnt want people to stay just for the money if they're not happy

&lt;hunter&gt; people should go where they're happy

&lt;hunter&gt; money affects your happiness minimums, not your maximums

&lt;hunter&gt; your maximums are limited by things like bad work environment, bad coworkers, etc

---

### 181

&lt;jaeger&gt; i just thought you'd like a warning

&lt;jaeger&gt; editable grids are like the hardest thing to get right

&lt;jaeger&gt; kasi everyone expects na naiintindihan mo na

&lt;jaeger&gt; when the truth is, maraming details na kelangan ispecify

&lt;jaeger&gt; and marami kayong case na hindi agad maiisip ihandle

&lt;jaeger&gt; tapos everyone does it differently pa

&lt;jaeger&gt; but it's the truth! 

---

### 212

---

### 571

it's up to you to raise when people are not following the spec

---

### 572

it's because you dont care

---

### 573

we should all resign and be hermits

---

### 574

&lt;hunter&gt; then it's a paradox

&lt;hunter&gt; baka naimpress sila kay mole

&lt;hunter&gt; then they're like &quot;all testers should be like him!&quot; 

---

### 575

it's not a thesis defense!

---

### 587

&lt;hunter&gt; this is impossible for us to evaluate, do you know why

&lt;hunter&gt; it's because she's a woman

&lt;hunter&gt; and we're men

&lt;hunter&gt; we can only evaluate stuff that makes sense 

---

### 588

&lt;hunter&gt; maybe nothing's wrong with you
