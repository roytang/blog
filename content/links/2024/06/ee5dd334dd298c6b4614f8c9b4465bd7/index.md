title: I Have a Terrible Memory. Am I Better Off That Way?

IDK about the duality between rememberers and forgetters described here, feels like the few people I asked weren't firmly in one camp or another, remembering some things and forgetting some, nothing as extreme as discussed in the article.

What did interest me was the notion that rememberers tend to be less happy than forgetters, mostly because I strive to try to be more of a rememberer via channels like this website or journalling or obsessive logging lol
