> "When you write a blog post, you can say as much or as little as you want. You can document a whole project you completed that made you happy, or you can document a tiny piece of it. You can share your plant watering routine, or you can share your journey of going from having no plants to six plants and the plant care tips you learned across the way. You can write a follow-up post, or not."
