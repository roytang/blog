In which Ed Zitron long-windedly blames SaaS for software being shitty and explains how that fuels the AI bubble.

> "While not all Software-As-A-Service companies are parasites, the incentive for these companies is less about serving your needs and more about making sure they're so deeply embedded in your organization that they're impossible to remove."

...
