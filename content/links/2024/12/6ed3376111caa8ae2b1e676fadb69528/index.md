On maintaining site archives:

> "You don’t have to like everything in your archive. Because archives are a kaleidoscope of your life. They aren’t just a reflection of how you are now. They are you now, a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago. They are how you were, are, and perhaps a hint of what you may become. That’s the sheer joy and magic of them. To snip and prune misses the whole point."

> "I just ask people to consider: there are many different audiences for your work. The actual author is just one of them. You might not like what your old self has to say any more… but it could be exactly what somebody else needed to read right at that very moment. It could inspire somebody to make something truly great. Everything links together, and who knows where the internet’s complex web of ideas might end up?"
