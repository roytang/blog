> "The reasoning for bringing in AI tools to monitor patients is always that it will make life easier for us, but in my experience, technology in healthcare rarely makes things better. It usually just speeds up the factory floor, squeezing more out of us, so they can ultimately hire fewer of us.

“Efficiency” is a buzzword in Silicon Valley, but get it out of your mind when it comes to healthcare. When you’re optimizing for efficiency, you’re getting rid of redundancies. But when patients’ lives are at stake, you actually want redundancy. You want extra slack in the system. You want multiple sets of eyes on a patient in a hospital.

> When you try to reduce everything down to a machine that one person relies on to carry out decisions, then there’s only one set of eyes on that patient. That may be efficient, but by creating efficiency, you’re also creating a lot of potential points of failure. So, efficiency isn’t as efficient as tech bros think it is."
