title: 'The Dark Side Of AI: Tracking The Decline Of Human Cognitive Skills'

> "Unlike earlier tools such as calculators and spreadsheets, which made specific tasks easier without fundamentally altering our ability to think, AI is reshaping the way we process information and make decisions, often diminishing our reliance on our own cognitive abilities."

> "A 2023 study ... found that students who relied heavily on AI for writing assignments performed worse on tests that required independent thought and reasoning compared to students who completed assignments without AI assistance."

Note: "The" in the headline implies this is the ONLY dark side of AI, which is far from the truth. "Making us dumber" is pretty bad, but still not as bad as "burning down the planet"
