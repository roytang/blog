> '"Always go to the funeral" means that I have to do the right thing when I really, really don't feel like it. I have to remind myself of it when I could make some small gesture, but I don't really have to and I definitely don't want to. I'm talking about those things that represent only inconvenience to me, but the world to the other guy. You know, the painfully under-attended birthday party. The hospital visit during happy hour. The Shiva call for one of my ex's uncles.'

When I was recovering from burnout, I promised myself that moving forward I would only do things that I would stop being pressured into doing things and only do things that I want to do (this has not been an easy promise to keep). One exception quickly emerged: if a friend or family member needs me to be there for them (to attend a wedding or a funeral or to visit at the hospital or some other ceremony I typically dislike), I will try to do it because I want to be there for them.
