A lot of detail here on how Google just doesn't care what happens to independent publishers.

> "I went to Google directly, on their behalf, and told them about the problem. The message I walked away with, was that they do not care. Our industry is done. Future entertainment news and opinion will come from AI recaps scraped and stolen from our archived content or from the big media companies backed by hedge funds that Google has chosen as its designated survivors."
