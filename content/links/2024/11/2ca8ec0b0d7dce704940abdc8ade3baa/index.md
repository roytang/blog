I never liked the idea of SEO. Even in it's infancy I always felt like it was sleazy marketing voodoo. And the worst part was that all of it was completely dependent on a platform that could change things on a whim.

At some point I did consider trying to earn money from blogging via ads, but that tendency quickly faded away when I realized I did not have the required focus or inclination to compromise my random ramblings enough to please the SEO gods. (Note: I am not suggesting I have ever written anything remotely close to a "stellar paragraph".
