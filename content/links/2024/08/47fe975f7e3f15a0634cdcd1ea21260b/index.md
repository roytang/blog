> "Making genuine novelty is all too often career suicide. We could have so much more, so much more variety and diversity, if we weren’t so utterly dominated by an economic system that values homogeneity and marketability over all. Which is why I get angry when people in tech – almost always in tech – talk as if novelty and creativity is rare. It isn’t. It’s stifled and unfunded."
