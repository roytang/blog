As someone who has always been a bit reserved when interacting with strangers, even online, I probably need to work more on "commenting to say how much you enjoy the content" or "dropping a quick note of appreciation via email or DM". I know I appreciate it when someone emails or DMs me about the blog, but somehow it feels like it would be bothersome if I do it!
