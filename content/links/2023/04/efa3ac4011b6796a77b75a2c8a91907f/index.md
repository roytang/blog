> "The way the web works now is: You have to compile your Node.js bundles into the dockerized Kubernetes, and once the Redis caches are asynchronously flooberized into your AWS Red Hat instances with optimized SQL queries, you can start distributing JWTs, <!--sep-->interpolating string literals, and distributing content over CDNs with performative grombulations at 10x, assuming you've A/B tested correctly and the user doesn't have AdBlock enabled.<!--sep--> This ever-growing heap is why software engineers are paid $1,000,000 per annum and get 180 days of vacation (with rollover)."
