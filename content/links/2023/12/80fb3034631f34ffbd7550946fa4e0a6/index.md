title: The great tweet archive

Curated archive of tweets since Twitter is dying. Took me a few days to get through it all. There are some bangers in there, but I wish I could just filter for "Hysterical" / "Weird", I really don't care about the "Famous" ones. Also, why is the list order randomized on every reload?!?
