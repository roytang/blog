title: Energy makes time | everything changes

> "They had assumed, wrongly, that there wasn’t enough time in the day to do their art, because they assumed ... that every thing we do costs time. But that math doesn’t take energy into account, doesn’t grok that doing things that energize you gives you time back. By doing their art, a whole lot of time suddenly returned. Their art didn’t need more time; their time needed their art."
