> My take is this: if you want to make money building something, sell it. If you want to release your software as open source, release the bit (or a bit) that doesnâ€™t have intrinsic business value. Use that value to pay for the rest. If you need money to eat and put a roof over your head, do what you need to get money. And then if you want to be altruistic, be altruistic with what you can afford to distribute.
