Not only is this bait-and-switch justification idiotic, but it reinforces my view that Tweetdeck dying is an inevitability. 

<!--sep-->The only chance Tweetdeck had was that it's left alone because only power users used it, but that's true of third-party clients as well. As soon as EM finds out he actually owns a (better) alternative web client that doesn't serve ads, it's over for Tweetdeck
