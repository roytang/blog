I understand it&#39;s intended to be of comfort to people who specialize in frontend or backend or devops, etc. and want to stay deep in one field\u2014but I also think it&#39;s a huge cop out in the fight against unnecessary complexity and over-engineered &quot;defaults&quot;.</p><p>I pride myself in being more of a generalist and would *never* advertise myself as anything but a fullstack web dev. IMHO that remains a hugely valuable skillset.</p>",
