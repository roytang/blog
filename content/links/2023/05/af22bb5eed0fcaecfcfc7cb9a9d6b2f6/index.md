title: Linear feeds are a dark pattern
---

"Dark pattern" might be a bit too strong here. I think sometimes you do want a linear feed, but sometimes you might want something like what the OP describes.

I think one issue is that anything more complicated than a linear feed might turn off most people who aren't terminally online, which is why most socmed platforms just default to a linear feed.

The grouping OP describes is a common feature of RSS feed readers! Though they typically don't have the "per day" grouping thing, that sounds like an option feed readers could implement.
