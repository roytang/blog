> "I have, to date, not used any AI coding tools, at all. I've actively removed them from my IDE. I don't want them. Not just because of questions of their quality (still lower than a human), or because I will miss writing elegant code (I know I will), but because I want my daughter to have a future, and a planet on which to live. Because I actually do care about respecting copyright.
