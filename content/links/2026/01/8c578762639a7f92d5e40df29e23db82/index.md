I spent way too much of my NYE/New Year's Day on this puzzle where you have to group 2025 items into 45 groups of 45, and I'm only around 70% done. It's like NYT Collections ratcheted up to an insane level, made even more challenging by a hilariously bare bones UI. Better to do it on a desktop, as big a screen as possible; don't try mobile unless you want to go crazy. My brain finds it difficult to stop @_@
