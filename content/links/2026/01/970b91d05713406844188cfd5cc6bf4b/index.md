title: My journey to the heart of the forgotten internet

> "It's hard to argue that today's internet isn't more useful, or at least more functional. But the internet used to feel like wandering through a college dorm, knocking on doors and seeing how each person had decorated their room to their individual tastes. You never knew what to expect, who you'd meet, or where you'd end up. It wasn't necessarily "better", but it was weirder, freer and far more personal."
