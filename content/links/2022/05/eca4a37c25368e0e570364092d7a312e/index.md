From a 70yo:
<!--sep-->
"Efficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic."
<!--sep-->
"Making art is not selfish; it’s for the rest of us. If you don’t do your thing, you are cheating us."

"So embrace detours. Life is not a straight line for anyone."

"You cant reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into."
<!--sep-->
I wish this list was numbered though.
