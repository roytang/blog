  "text": "I am totally against this. Not the extension to 6 years, that's fine. But it's ridiculous to have them become EVEN MORE specialized in sciences/math/ technology.    We do not let people test out of classes in the Philippines with Advanced Placement, so there's absolutely no advantage at all. There's the disadvantage that Pisay graduates will coast even farther into college before having to start studying again for stuff. It would be better if those 2 extra years translated to internships in different college labs/field work/etc, so that students would have a better idea of what being a biologist/ engineer/doctor means before they have to make a decision on a course.",
