Actually, they should close the furniture stores too, because you can break apart any wooden chair or table and use the legs as clubs. The bars for barbells are way more potent weapons than hammers.     Then you have to take into account clever people who watch youtube who can make an ied out of a coffee thermos, axe spray, a condom, water, and a cellphone battery.",
