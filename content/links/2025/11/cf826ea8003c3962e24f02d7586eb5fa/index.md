title: Where’s the AI design renaissance?

> "Don’t get me wrong. I’ve had some incredibly productive moments with AI design tools. But I’ve had at least as many slogs, where I can’t get it to do some basic thing I should’ve done myself 45 minutes ago. And even those productive moments are generally for less important, less business-critical, less live-in-production design stuff."
