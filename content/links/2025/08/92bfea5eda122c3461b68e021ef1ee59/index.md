title: The Server Doesn't Render Anything

> "When I advise people on how they should structure a web service, I always start from the same place: make a server that responds to HTTP requests with HTML text.

> That is the most durable, cost-effective, and user-friendly way to build a web service. Most web services should be built this way absent an excellent reason not to."
