> "I see the personal website as being an antidote to the corporate, centralised web. Yeah, sure, it's probably hosted on someone else's computer â€“ but it's a piece of the web that belongs to you. If your host goes down, you can just move it somewhere else, because it's just HTML."

> "I want to be clear, I'm not telling you to ditch social media completely, or stop building websites for business. There is still plenty of room on the web for commercial websites alongside the independent personal web. This is very much not a plea to go back to the old days of GeoCities, but rather a plea to bring the magic of the old days into the present day."
