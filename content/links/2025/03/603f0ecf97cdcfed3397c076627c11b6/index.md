> I remember having a conversation with my Dad right after I graduated college. So I was 22 and he was 52. I don’t remember what we were talking about but I remember when he looked at me and said, “You know, I still feel just the same inside as I did when I was 22.” 

Same. A lot of times I still feel like that dumb young adult from 2 decades ago.
