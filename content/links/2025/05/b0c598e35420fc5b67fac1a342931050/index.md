> "The starting point was the desktop/laptop that everyone was familiar with. Ethan Marcotte's brilliant insight was to jettison that thinking and, instead, tackle the problem from an entirely new perspective: mobile first. Assume you have a small screen and create a linear presentation. If you have more horizontal space, let your design flow to fill it. That's it. That's Responsive Web Design."
