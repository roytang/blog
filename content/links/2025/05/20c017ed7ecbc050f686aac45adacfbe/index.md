> "The most reliable antidote to despair is action. The always-on, always moving news cycle and shock doctrine scale of destruction is designed to make you feel hopeless and feeble, as if there’s nothing to do but numb yourself to the terror. This, like so much else we’re confronted with today, is a lie."

> "Art brings us back to ourselves, helps us root in our own agency and creative power, makes space for the joy of craft and play, and reminds us of our purpose in the world. On dark days, it’s easy to think that there’s no room for art, because the work of survival is so demanding. But art doesn’t merely take time—it gives time and energy back. It renews our spirits and the spirits of everyone who sees or hears or experiences the art, who receives the art as it’s intended: as a gift."
