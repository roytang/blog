> "Generative AI, or, to be more precise, the stuff we get sold as AI¹, is bad. It’s bad for the environment. It steals from everyone without asking. It’s wrong in very strange ways half of the time, we have no idea how it actually works and it’s controlled by billionaires. Some of this might change, even though I don’t think it will. But one thing will stay the same: AI is like frozen pizza."

> "I want things real people put real work into. Where they invest all their ideas, feelings, passion, experience, and everything they are. I want to feel a connection—the message they wish to send."
