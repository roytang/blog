> "Seeing how easy it is to get attention while most of it is so disgusting, why is it worthwhile to you? Why do you still believe that attention is a reward that goes to people who are better than you and worked so hard to deserve it? Many, many people do fuck-all in terms of how hard it was. Doing the above things is not hard. Staying authentic and true to yourself without being swayed by public opinion and attention is."
