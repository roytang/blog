[From Genny Rumancik](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMbE6VOhDzv/):

> Hard things are supposed to be hard.
> 
> Changing old patterns, ending relationships youâ€™ve outgrown, raising children, creating from your core, letting go, stretching, growing, and stepping into the unknown.
> 
> The more worthwhile endeavors require you to show up vulnerably & honestly, and they leave space for something new to happen.
