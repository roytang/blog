> The AI-replaces-services narrative is fantasy.
> 
> Not because AI can't do the work. It can.
> 
> But because the economics don't translate the way VCs claim. When you replace a $50,000 employee with AI, you don't capture $50,000 in software revenue. You capture $5,000 if you're lucky.
> 
> The market isn't 100-200x bigger. It's maybe 10-20% of what the PowerPoints claim.
