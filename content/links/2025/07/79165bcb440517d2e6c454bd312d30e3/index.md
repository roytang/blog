> "Write urgently. Publish quickly."

> "The same goes for the ideas, the words you’ll write down. Write them down when they’re on the top of your mind, while you’re still excited to get them out. For ideas have a half-life of their own. Wait and they’ll go stale, and you’ll second-guess if they’re worth publishing."
