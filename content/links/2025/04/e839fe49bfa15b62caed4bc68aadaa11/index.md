title: Almost Every Food Would Be Better Served in a Bowl

> "Bowls are, broadly speaking, easier than plates, and more versatile, but it’s more than that. If niceness and kindness aren’t synonyms but in fact closer to antonyms, plates are nice, and bowls are kind. Plates are the dining room; bowls are the kitchen. Plates are scarcity; bowls are abundance. <!--sep-->Plates are capitalism; bowls are socialism. Plates are a backward longing for an imaginary twentieth century; bowls are the dream of a better world. Plates are small talk; bowls are the part of a party where everybody sits on the floor."
