title: The Rich Are Hoarding Wealth — Because They Know What’s Coming
---

> "The rich are not scrambling to prevent collapse. They welcome it — because they know they’ll be the only ones left standing. While the rest of us are told to “sacrifice” and “tighten our belts,” billionaires are building bunkers, buying private islands, and hoarding resources for the dystopia they see coming."

This essay is long and bleak. Sigh.
