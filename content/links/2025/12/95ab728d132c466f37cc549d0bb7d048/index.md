> If you need a rule, take this one: honour the interruptions. Friendship is an interruption of yourself by the world and of the world by yourself. If nothing interrupts you, you are not living; you are a screensaver. Go be interrupted. Go be available to be changed. The door is heavy, but it’s on your side of the hinge.
<!--sep-->
> And when your friends finally betray you by prospering, or disappointing you by healing, or abandoning you by not dying on schedule, sit on a bench and bless them with a curse that works in reverse: May you be spared the version of me that needed you to keep being exactly who you were. Then stand up. Walk to the shop that sells nothing you need. Look at everything like it might suddenly speak. It will. It does. It already has.
