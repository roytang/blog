title: Links make the web great
---

> "I am actually kinda terrible at talking about things, I’m decent in some scenarios or with previous preparation, like presentations where I can write down my thoughts beforehand, but I still struggle otherwise.
> 
> In the web, I don’t worry much about it, just express what I want, and link to other pages explaining missing context, if I deem it necessary.
> 
> And to me, that’s great, because it lets me discover the web the way it was intended to be."
