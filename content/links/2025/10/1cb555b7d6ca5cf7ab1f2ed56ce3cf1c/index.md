title: Have I Earned It?
---

Kottke quoting Craig Mod:

> "He wonders, always wonders, if he has earned it. The time alone, the steps, the little interactions, the looking closely at the world. He takes it, he’ll take whatever he can get whenever, and try to be as grateful as possible. What else is there? Tiny men with big sticks upend sanity the world ‘round and all you can do is try to find your footing and push back."

Trent Siegfried in the comments:

> "My personal philosophy is that none of us have earned it, and that a moment of peace when you're on a beautiful walk, or looking at a flower, or playing with a child is a genuine gift from the universe, with no need to repay it. I haven't earned that gift, it is given to me freely."
