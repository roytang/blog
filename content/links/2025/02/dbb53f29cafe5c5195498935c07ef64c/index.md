A history of Musk's radicalization. All of this just reinforces my belief that being too full of yourself and not being able to admit mistakes can lead to disastrous consequences, especially when you have billions at your disposal.

There's an excerpt about how he plays cards that sounds about right:

> “There were all these nerds and sharpsters who were good at memorizing cards and calculating odds,” he told Musk biographer Walter Isaacson. “Elon just proceeded to go all in on every hand and lose. Then he would buy more chips and double down. Eventually, after losing many hands, he went all in and won. Then he said, ‘Right, fine, I’m done.'”
