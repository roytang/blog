title: Outgrowing Friendships | Notes by JCProbably

> Looking back at all these different kinds of friendship, I now understand that there’s no need for guilt in outgrowing these friendships. We don’t typically shame ourselves for outgrowing old clothes2 or hobbies, so why should this be any different? People change, our priorities shift, and sometimes the space we once fit together just isn’t the same anymore.

I wish things lasted forever, including friendships.
