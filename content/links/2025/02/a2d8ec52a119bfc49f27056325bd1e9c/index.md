On quitting:

> Remember also that quitting is a choice and you get to make it. That’s one of the most beautiful and sacred things about quitting—it’s an exercise of your agency and power in the world, and one that no one can take away from you. You are the one who knows what’s best for you and your kin, and you get to decide how to act on that knowledge. Someday, maybe someday soon, that will mean making the choice to quit—and I invite you to honor that choice, as you honor your great and beautiful life.
