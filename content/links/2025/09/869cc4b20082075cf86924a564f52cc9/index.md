title: Treat your to-read pile like a river | Oliver Burkeman
---

> this means treating your "to read" pile like a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). After all, you presumably don't feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library â€“ and not because there aren't an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.
