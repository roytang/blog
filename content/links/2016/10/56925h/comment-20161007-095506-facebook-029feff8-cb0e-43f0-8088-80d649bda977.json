  "text": "\"- pure speculation and really not grounded on actual reality. are there gov't attempts to censure any critic? social media has done away with that kind imposition of government don't you think?\" -> my impression is that social media has made it so that government doesn't have to impose any censure, when there are forces actively goading the masses to consider anyone who criticizes or disagrees with the administration as \"enemies of change\".    It's definitely an opinion piece, hindi naman sya prinepresent as news. Maybe the author is a bit overzealous in some spots in promoting his worldview, but the same can be said of the president is it not?    But even if you disagree with the author's opinions, that doesn't mean they aren't worth consideration. Even though presumably not the majority opinion, there are still a good number of people who share these opinions, are these opinions of no value for public discourse such that we simply dismiss them as presumptuous?     Do you not find the increasing attitude of acceptance towards authoritarianis m disturbing? Or the increasing attitude towards blindly believing and trusting everything the president says and does without question?",
