  "text": "Re: authoritarianis m, I accept the wikipedia definition: government characterized by strong central power and limited political freedoms.   I tend to view as increasing acceptance towards authoritarianis m stuff like:  - saying we have too much freedom  - saying martial law is a good idea/justified  - saying the government should control or censor media  - attacking a justice for simply quoting the law on civil liberties  - believing that only a certain person in authortiy can \"save\" the country  - believing that person is infallible and must be trusted no matter what  - saying civil/human rights, due process, etc are not important  - proposals to reduce the scope of civil rights (like to suspend the writ of hc, etc)  - proposals to increase state power over citizens without corresponding oversight or checks and balances  (all of the above I have seen in online discussions only within the past two weeks)    \" thus the need to qualify, qualify, qualify.\" -> the president should heed this advice as well, so that he is \"misunderstood\"  less often  :p",
