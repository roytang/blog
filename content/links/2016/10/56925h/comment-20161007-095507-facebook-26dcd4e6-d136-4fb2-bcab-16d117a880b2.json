  "text": "<when there are forces actively goading the masses to consider anyone who criticizes or disagrees with the administration as \"enemies of change\".>    - what forces do you think these is/are? i'm all for freedom of speech and selling your assertions in the marketplace of ideas... but to attribute some sort of masterplan orchestrating these to the administration against their critics even only by insinuation may be barking at the wrong tree at best, condescending to people with other assertions or  malicious, at worst.    <It's definitely an opinion piece, hindi naman sya prinepresent as news. Isn't it also presumptuous to just reject all of the author's opinions as presumptuous or self-absorbed simply because you don't share them? Maybe the author is a bit overzealous in some spots in promoting his worldview, but the same can be said of the president is it not?>  - to reject all  presumptuous or self-absorbed opoinions  because i don't share them? no. just because they are Demonstrably self-absorbed and presumptuous, yes, depends on how patient i am at the moment. could be presumptuous if one does not accept qualifications that negate the perceived presumptuousnes s or self-absorption .  ^_^    <Even though presumably not the majority opinion, there are still a good number of people who share these opinions, are these opinions of no value for public discourse such that we simply dismiss them as presumptuous? >  - all opinions are acceptable in public discourse. doesn't mean they are not fair game to be demonstrated as presumptuous and dismissed because of it. thus the need to qualify, qualify, qualify.    <Do you not find the increasing attitude of acceptance towards authoritarianis m disturbing? Or the increasing attitude towards blindly believing and trusting everything the president says and does without question?>  - i don't think there is an 'increasing' attitude  towards authoritarianis m, Roy. i believe that the attitude to prefer a strong leader that delivers is a desire present in all people. A lot think they found that in rrd. they are loath to part with him after hoping for a very long time(generation s). i'm also curious how you define 'authoritariani sm' in the sense that you used in your sentence?  -blindly believing? i guess there are those who do. can't get rid of those types but i do not think they are a significant majority nor do I think they cannot be reasoned with. well, i guess the work in the marketplace of ideas is to disabuse such blindly accepted ideas, right? but if the ideas which seem blind to some can be justified by assertions.. then , we go back to the marketplace with these ideas included for consideration.",
