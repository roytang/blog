went out to look for (real) bread, took 45mins to find an open bakery. this city needs to wake up earlier

[07:33] all my bags are packed im ready to go. heading out to check in at central

[09:25] at hkia having a croissant from burger king

[10:28] flight's boarding, next tweet will probly be from home. not sure if i have enough pesos for the cab

[10:38] so theyre boarding seats 66 and up first and some filipina in seat 50+ asks if her seat is included.

[10:41] i wonder if that sort of thing gives pinoys a rep of either cant follow directions or bad at math. or both

[15:47] home sweet home! it's 18 degrees warmer here than at hk this morning but there's no place like home
