flying out to bangkok tonight; ngayon lang ako makakapunta sa ibang time zone!

<time>[2009-08-21 11:53] </time> Arrived safely. Unfortunately, there was no free wifi, either at the hotel or the venue =/ Mahirap magupdate =(

<time>[2009-08-24 13:01] </time> It is your moral responsibility to install Firefox or Chrome on strange internet cafe workstations that only have IE.

<time>[2009-08-24 13:02] </time> Just checked out of the hotel, flight back is at midnight tonight.

<time>[2009-08-24 13:02] </time> #mtg #gpbangkok Yes, I performed poorly. Overall record was 3-8 including side events. =/

[16:44] #mtg #gpbangkok Correction: My weekend record was 4-9. 7-9 with byes. Will do better next time!
