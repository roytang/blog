trying to download Windows 7 RC, but Microsoft's downloader ActiveX isn't cooperating

[2009-08-05 01:27] @bry_bibat I forgot I had firefox. I only tried with IE and Chrome

[2009-08-05 07:46] will now attempt to install Windows 7 RC on the laptop. Hope it doesn't break!

[2009-08-05 10:28] upgrade complete! That took longer than I expected
