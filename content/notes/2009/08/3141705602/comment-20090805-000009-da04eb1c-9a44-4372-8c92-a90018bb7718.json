  "text": "Ang caveat lang...apparent ly one-way yung upgrade, there&#x27;s no way to go back to the previous vista installation unless you backed it up before. I backed up my data, but I can&#x27;t find my vista backup from when I first purchased the laptop, so I need to figure something out when the release candidate expires in march  :p",
