  "text": "Hrmm...  I guess those are mostly OK, except Indiana Jones was really chaotic good.  He&#x27;s a rule-breaker and thinks nothing of stealing stuff or beating up random people for the sake of humanity.      Also, Darth Vader being lawful evil - I don&#x27;t know about that.  He never saw himself as evil, he didn&#x27;t really care about power, he cared about order and was ruthless only for the sake of order - he chose the Emperor because the Emperor got that way by political, law-abiding means (aside from the whole wanting to save Padme thing).  Maybe Vader should be lawful neutral.",
