  "text": "I agree with this, really.     Though, would&#x27;ve been best if creator showed empyrical data. I have to admit I&#x27;m only biased because of the promised positives. While he gave specific ways to improve productivity, no real experiments or proof was given more than the graphical representation.    The Ford Experiments seem interesting. Maybe they&#x27;ll yield more conclusive evidence.",
