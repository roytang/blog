  "text": "@Jaime think of it in terms of: the &quot;boss&quot; is the guy who can only direct other people down a known path. The leader helps other people by walking the path with them. The builder is the one who creates new paths for people to follow.    I agree that &quot;come&quot; may not necessarily be the best phrasing here (I guess it&#x27;s derived from &quot;build it and they will come&quot;), but the point is that we need the sort of people - builders - who are willing to forge ahead of other people and find those paths which will lead us forward.
