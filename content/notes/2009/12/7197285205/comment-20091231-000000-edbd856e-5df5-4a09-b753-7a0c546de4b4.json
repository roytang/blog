  "text": "I know that the builder&#x27;s supposed to be the pinnacle of the statement, but it rubs me the wrong way. I prefer the Leader&#x27;s line.    *tl;dr version. I believe builder&#x27;s words are honeyed. The leader&#x27;s more upfront and honest.*    The builder&#x27;s statement only works when things are &quot;going well&quot; already, or if he&#x27;s trying to tell people that things will be easy his way. Either he&#x27;s done all the hard work already, and is inviting growth by evangelizing, or he&#x27;s tricking people into fulfilling his vision (I use the word &quot;tricking&quot; liberally, as his purpose may be benign).    The leader, I find, is in a position that is undesirable (a problem), and is enticing people to do what is needed to get out of it with him. OR, at the very least, if there&#x27;s a way out, or a better way, he&#x27;s making no presumptions that it will be an easy road, but he is willing to undertake that road, no matter how difficult it may be, with you.",
