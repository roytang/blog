  "text": "Under the assumption that education can translate to higher standard of living, even exposure to education has a benefit.  Education should enable students to conceive better conditions for self and environment to motivate them to improve.  Self-motivation  is a goal that cannot be shared without education for masses - it will be difficult for the few better-educated  to impress upon their fellows that things need to get better if they don&#x27;t know any better.    A self-motivated individual has better purpose for both themselves and their community, government, etc.  Education is the most common-denomina tor tool, with a better transmission rate than mass-media (though these two can work together), since it can be recontextualize d for individual consumption.",
