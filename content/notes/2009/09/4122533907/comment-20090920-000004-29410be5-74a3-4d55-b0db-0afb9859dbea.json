  "text": "Then I&#x27;d go for higher-quality education for a select few. If all things are equal. There are enough people who are, at the moment, able to afford good education on their own, or apply for scholarships without overloading private schools. Government-mand ated education will help what they can. Enforce rules to avoid brain drain. Make it enticing to work here. There are not enough opportunities to work locally anyway.     But it&#x27;s very unfair though. I would not want to decide who gets it and who doesn&#x27;t. The other situation is more socially acceptable.",
