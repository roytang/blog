  "text": "I understand that Michael&#x27;s/ Lorenz&#x27;s comments are against my own, but I see the wisdom in what they say also. If you cast &quot;low-quality&quot; education in that light - which is, education is not necessarily a tool for learning and success only, but as a means of motivation and an opener for self-discovery (which then leads to success), then yes, the idea is rock solid. It will be up to the individual to bridge the gap between education, life goals, and what they will make with what limited tools they have - but this should be enough, if the person really wants to get ahead in life.    I believe my idea operates on the premise of a good job/career = success per se, and expects this to be the most common means of success (may or may not be true), which quality education will unlock, versus low-quality education.",
