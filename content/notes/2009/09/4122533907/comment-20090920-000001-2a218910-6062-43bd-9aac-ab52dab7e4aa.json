  "text": "If the objective is progress of society, and those are your two options, I would suggest to focus on something else, like making more money to finance good education for all. Best to provide a bit of both (like we&#x27;re doing today). We need to upgrade secondary-educa tion-level employment to allow those without good (i.e. tertiary) education a chance to improve their state, or maintain a good lifestyle despite lacking tertiary, but also require people who received free good education to give back to the community.",
