title: '"Technologically challenged"'

Recently signed up for an account on a hospital's web site to get test results for someone else and the site has the option to specify that you are creating an account on behalf of someone else because they are "technologically challenged".

I like that they understand that a lot of patients (esp. elderly ones) might not be tech-savvy, although I'm not sure what changes in the backend depending on this choice.
