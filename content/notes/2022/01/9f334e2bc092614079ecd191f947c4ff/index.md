From the description, I expected some kind of John Wick-style revenge action film; that was nowhere near correct. The film defies expectations at almost every turn, going in directions I never expected. <!--sep-->It feels like to explain the film would be to ruin it, so I won't. It is pretty good, and we get a serious Cage performance in this one.
