Finally watched this despite not knowing anything about League of Legends, mostly because everyone kept raving about how great it was. First off, the animation and aesthetic are fantastic and top-notch.

Story is ok, a typical tragic class conflict where there are few real heroes. Music is great; I like the opening song by Imagine Dragons. Will probably watch the next season.
