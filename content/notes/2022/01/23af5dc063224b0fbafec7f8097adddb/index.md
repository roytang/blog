title: Only Murders in the Building

I binged the first season of this last week because I saw a good review of it. It's a comedy, but not a laugh-out-loud funny one, more wit than laugh track, though Steve Martin does put in some physical comedy at some point. <!--sep-->It was ok, reasonably clever, but also a bit predictable. True crime fans might enjoy it more. Not sure if I'd watch the next season.
