<!--sep-->Someone gave me a new sketchbook, pencil and eraser a while back, I thought I'd give them a go. Haven't used pencil in a while, I find myself thinking I can just undo (too used to digital) instead of going for the eraser. I need a sharpener.

<!--sep-->The Jyn Erso one is a second attempt at [one I did in 2016](/2016/12/BOJWNfYhTU6/), though I'm not sure this one is better.
