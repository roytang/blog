#### Posted on r/StreetFighter: [SFV: Any way to export my fighter profile data?](https://www.reddit.com/r/StreetFighter/comments/t3y7h9/sfv_any_way_to_export_my_fighter_profile_data/)

There's a whole bunch of stats there in the fighter profile I'd like to be able to export to my PC (any parseable format is fine), likes win rates, per character usage rates, etc. Anyone know if there's any way to extract or export that data? I have both PS4 and Steam accounts, so if possible I'd like to be able to export data for both profiles.
