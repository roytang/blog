It's even more annoying given that a good part of the world is still in a pandemic, and many would have been unable or unwilling to go out to theaters to watch in the first few days, and after that people just casually drop spoilers wherever.

I was only able to watch No Way Home a couple of weeks ago because there was an Omicron surge in my country at the time it came out and I had no way to watch it safely. To say that I was disappointed with how much the internet spoiled to me is putting it mildly. And that's with me avoiding watching trailers and such. The movie experience would have been so much better if I had been able to watch day one (but even then all the leaks/rumors headlines would have already ruined some stuff for you!)

I'm honestly thinking of just giving it up for Multiverse and Madness and just reading and watching everything, but that seems like a miserable time.

Maybe this is just the price we have to pay for all the comic book films we are getting and for indulging this cinematic juggernaut.
