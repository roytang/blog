Last night I wanted to watch a movie and settled on Drive (2011), mostly because of Carey Mulligan, who I really only knew from [Blink](/2012/10/255642233682939904/). This film went from slow burn to sudden, graphic violence real quick. The protagonist hardly says anything. Very neo-noir. The director lingers on every shot, letting the audience soak up the mood. I feel like Ryan Gosling here is playing the same type of character he was in [Blade Runner 2046](/2021/12/movies-tv-sep-dec-2021/#blade-runner-2049-2017), but I haven't seen enough of his movies to know if that's typical for his range. The film isn't really about driving cars, although it has a couple of good driving sequences.
