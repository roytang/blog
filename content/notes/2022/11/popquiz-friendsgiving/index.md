Final PopQuiz for the year!

Rounds were:

1. Live Action TV - 6pts
2. Movies - 7pts x 0 for failed ace
3. Naruto - 8pts x2 for powerup
4. Animated TV - 3pts
5. Video and Board Games - 4pts
6. Fictional Bands (audio round) - 7pts (out of 20)

The Naruto round was chosen by us as a benefit of placing third [last month](/2022/10/popquiz-stage/). We had originally submitted House of the Dragon as the topic, but we later found out our HotD person wouldn't be available, so we switched it out.

Despite the poor performance and disastrous ace usage, we still managed to finish in 3rd place. The quiz was very difficult overall, so I guess most of the other teams had trouble too.
