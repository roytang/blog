Drafting Brothers War on #MagicArena! ep3 https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgbro

<time id="1595042749891608578">[21:13]</time> Third draft day went slightly better than the previous days. Managed a 3 and a 6 respectively. I thought the first draft deck was better but the second one got more wins. Am I doomed to always go WB? At least I made fewer misplays today!
