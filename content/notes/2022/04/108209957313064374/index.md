<p>I have a triviabot that I run over on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/triviastorm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="">twitter.com/triviastorm</span><span class="invisible"></span></a>)</p><p>Do you think it would be a good idea to port it over to Mastodon?</p><p>If so, what would be a good instance to host it? I don&#39;t think my current instance (mastodon.technology) is appropriate</p>
