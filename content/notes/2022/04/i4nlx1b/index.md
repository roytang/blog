A card's color identity is not the same as its color. \[\[Tazri, Beacon of Unity\]\] has a color identity of WUBRG because of the rule you mentioned, but it's still only a white creature (can't be bounced by \[\[Aether Gust\]\] etc). Color identity is really only relevant for commander/brawl purposes.
