  title: John Grisham books - The Client and The Partner
---

Found some old John Grisham #books among my shelves. They look well-read, but I do not remember the plots of these books at all! It's probably been at least 20 years since I read them! I think the only Grisham book I do remember reading and still vaguely remember the plot is The Firm.
