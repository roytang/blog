title: Reddit Recap 2022
---

It's that time of the year, when online companies like Reddit give you stats! (I love stats!)

Seems like I spent way more on Reddit this year, probably due to enjoying all the Alchemy drama on [r/MagicArena](https://reddit.com/r/MagicArena/) lol

Annoyance: On mobile, your recap can only be accessed by downloading the mobile app. Also, I wish they had text-only versions of this data.
