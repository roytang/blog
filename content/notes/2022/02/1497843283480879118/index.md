Threw some gems away on the #mtgneo #MagicArena open this weekend. My sealed deck felt good, and I had the choice of 2 or 4 colors, but the odds were not in my favor. I was bummed so I did a quick draft afterwards which went much better!

<time>[16:01]</time> Doing poorly at an Arena Open is roughly the same level of feel bad as doing poorly at a GP, except at least I didn't have to travel and spend a bunch of money (only gems) just to get trounced!
