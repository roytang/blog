New #MagicArena stats email dropped! 



Sadly it looks like they have really discontinued the most drafted commons/uncommons bit from the old versions.



I played so much VOW @_@ 789 games and 177 boosters is a record!

<time>[05:25]</time> Looks like around 100k gold per season is typical, which makes those events that cost 25k gold entry seem so much more ridiculous.



This is the first of these where my favorite format isn't traditional constructed. I really should compile my draft stats sometime.
