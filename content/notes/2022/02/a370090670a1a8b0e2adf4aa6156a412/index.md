Watched this last night, since it was the last Jack Ryan movie I hadn't seen yet. (Coulda sworn it wasn't on Prime Video last year). It was ok. Ben Affleck's performance wasn't outstanding or anything, and the setup in the first half took a bit too long and was mostly just people talking and such, but the action-thriller part in the second half was good. I can see how releasing this in the climate less than a year after 9/11 might have been problematic though.
