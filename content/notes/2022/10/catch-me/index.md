Watched *Catch Me If You Can* last night. Actually over two nights. Been meaning to see this for a while, it looked neat. 

Frank Abagnale's capers are largely entertaining, though the narration does feel heavily exaggerated in favor of the protagonist (and reading through [Abagnale's wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale) suggests so as well). DiCaprio and Hanks give great performances here and I really enjoyed how they spoke every Christmas became friends by the end.
