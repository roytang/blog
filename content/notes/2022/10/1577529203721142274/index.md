I sometimes think about running a small hole-in-the-wall used bookstore in suburban Metro Manila, the kind where you have maybe 3-4 visitors a day and I spend all day in front of a computer while manning the shop, working on random things. We also buy and sell used PS3 games

I don't know a single person who works in tech and hasn't seriously thought about quitting and opening up a coffee shop in a small town in the middle of nowhere
