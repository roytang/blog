Contrary to popular belief, most DLC isn’t content that was maliciously cut from the game to make an extra buck. 



DLC has its own budget, timelines, greenlight, staff, etc. It’s a whoooole separate project. And nowadays it’s necessary for a AAA/AAAA game to ever break even. https://twitter.com/PushDustIn/status/1537598685625737216
