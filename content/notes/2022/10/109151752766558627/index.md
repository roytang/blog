<p>Aight, so notes on migrating to a new Mastodon instance:</p><p>I found the ff helpful: <a href="https://edtechfactotum.com/migrating-to-a-new-mastodon-home/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">edtechfactotum.com/migrating-t</span><span class="invisible">o-a-new-mastodon-home/</span></a></p><p>I was able to successfully create the alias to the old account on this new account, so the bug mentioned in the above is already fixed.</p><p>However, I was unable to create the redirect from the old account (&quot;is not an alias of this account&quot;). Looks like a cache invalidation issue (<a href="https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/issues/12216" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="invisible">https://</span><span class="ellipsis">github.com/mastodon/mastodon/i</span><span class="invisible">ssues/12216</span></a>), I&#39;ll try again in a couple of days I guess</p>

<time id="109163070167071376">[2022-10-14 05:24] </time> <p>Update: finally got <span class="h-card"><a href="https://mastodon.technology/@roytang" class="u-url mention">@<span>roytang@mastodon.technology</span></a></span> and <span class="h-card"><a href="https://mastodon.social/@roytang" class="u-url mention">@<span>roytang@mastodon.social</span></a></span> to redirect here. Apparently that results in a bunch of notifs as your followers are automatically forwarded to the new account!</p>
