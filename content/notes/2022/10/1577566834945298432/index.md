My headcanon is that Vic Rodriguez is out because he kept nagging Jr to get some work done - like the SRA thing - and that TCA is out because she kept asking about how to justify all the partying and other shenanigans. Calida is out probably for being an asshole or sth

<time id="1577567901447753730">[15:54]</time> Bersamin knows all of this so he just immediately got to work in making up nonsense to justify the F1 thing in a way that doesn't prejudice any future excuse #philippines #politics
