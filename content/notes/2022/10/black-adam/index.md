Enjoyed *Black Adam*, despite the poor critic reviews. The plot isn't anything spectacular, but it's a fun romp and good for comic fans.

Was very happy to be correct that [the actress playing Adrianna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Shahi) was Shaw from [Person of Interest](/tags/personofinterest/)! She should have gotten higher billing. Brosnan gave a great performance as Fate. The VFX guys really loved Cyclone. Atom Smasher probably my favorite of the JSA crew. The Rock maximizing the use of his one "smoldering" look. 

Viola Davis, Jennifer Holland, Djimon Hounsou, and [surprise mid-credits actor cameo] reprising roles were welcome surprises.

The only character I didn't actually like was Hawkman, mostly because (a) Hawkman is a terrible character; and (b) this version seemed even worse than usual (why is he rich?), and for some reason they chose him to be head of the JSA!

Overall IDK about changing the hierarchy of power or whatever, but I think a pretty decent step forward for the DCEU.
