  "text": "> For Amonkhet Remastered, they also included some reprints from sets outside of the block, but with new flavor/art to match the plane, so that might happen here as well\n\nI believe all of the \"outside the set\" cards in Amonkhet Remastered was from the [Invocations special sheet](https://scryfall.com/sets/mp2), using the invocation art but in a normal card frame (and thank goodness for that!). SOI didn't have a special sheet, so we might not get anything like that this time.",
