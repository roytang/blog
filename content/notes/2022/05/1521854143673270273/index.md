MCU Spoiler-free reviews



Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness:



- fun, trippy and very "comic book" movie

- better if you have seen Wandavision

- don't bring kids, they might get scared

<time id="1521854144998371330">[22:07]</time> Moon Knight:



- some beautiful shots of varied locations

- great performances

- plot was ok, episode 5 was weird but probably the best one

- ending a bit weak

- probably enjoy it more if you're into the comics
