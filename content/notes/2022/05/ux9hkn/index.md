#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Around 800k votes was enough to get 2% in the party list elections. There are 859k members of r/Philippines. We should run a party-list in 2025.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/ux9hkn/around_800k_votes_was_enough_to_get_2_in_the/)

Actually, the threshold of votes needed should be quite a bit lower, since very few parties got 2%, so I believe they will proportionally parcel out slots to the lower ranked parties.

If everyone on the sub voted for our party list (unlikely), we wouldn't even have to campaign!

Don't ask me what our party-list agenda should be. But I believe marginalized sector naman ang r/PH redditors lol
