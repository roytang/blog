Did 5 runs on the Standard Challenge on #MagicArena with the below Jund list. Didn't get there but that's a pretty good 72% win rate!



| Record | Gold | Packs |
|---|---|---|
| 3-1 | +0 | +3 |
| 2-1 | -500 | +1 |
| 4-1 | +500 | +5 |
| 0-1 | -1500 | |
| 4-1 | +500 | +5 |

<time>[2022-05-30 21:00]</time> The event was still available, so I tried a Jund list from [the recent Japan Championship](https://mtgazone.com/japan-championship-2022/) and did poorly.

Sigh.
