Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness:

- fun, trippy and very "comic book" movie
- better if you have seen Wandavision
- don't bring kids, they might get scared
<!--sep--> 
Moon Knight:

- some beautiful shots of varied locations
- great performances
- plot was ok, episode 5 was weird but probably the best one
- ending a bit weak
- probably enjoy it more if you're into the comics
