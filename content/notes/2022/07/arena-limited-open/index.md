Threw away some gems on the Arena Open today, my sealed pool had some high-end bombs but felt otherwise mediocre:

- lost game 1 to skanos
- lost game 2 to [monster manual](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/242/monster-manual-zoological-study) into [hourglass coven](https://scryfall.com/card/hbg/45/the-hourglass-coven) =/ (into skanos again)
- sigh. lost game 3 to [Oyaminartok](https://scryfall.com/card/hbg/68/oyaminartok-polar-werebear)

Welp. That was terrible.
