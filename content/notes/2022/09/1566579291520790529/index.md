I think my ADHD is a lot milder than this, but I can relate. It's one of the most common reasons my sleep cycle is screwed up; my brain hyperfocuses on something and i cant sleep until i resolve it

ADHD can make it hard to STOP focusing on something. 



This is fucking terrifying cause you can't stop your brain, and you feel out of control.



I once stayed up for over 40 hours, cause I couldn't stop reading this novel. 



My friends had to come make food for me.
