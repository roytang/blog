Quiz night!

First face to face quiz night since the pandemic began!

Rounds were: 

1. Two films one plot - films with the same plot
2. Book to Film Adaptations
3. Iconic Scenes / Scripts
4. Cannes Spotlight
5. Movie Posters - spot the poster edit
6. Movie Soundtracks

We were doing well, but we hit the failed ace in round 5. If we had gotten it we would have won the whole thing. Still managed to tie for 3rd and win the tiebreaker though!

It was a fun session, we had some good pulls, and it was nice to have an in-person quiz night again.
