#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Do we know who those two civilian-looking people in the background of the preview covers for All New X-Men #1 are?](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/104xol/do_we_know_who_those_two_civilianlooking_people/)

I couldnt find the pic online, but there's a guy on the left cover in a green shirt and a blonde girl in a red dress on the right cover, do we have any idea who they are?
