#### Posted on r/skyrim: [Can anyone suggest interesting content mods (quests, dungeons, etc) for Skyrim (no Dawnguard)?](https://reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/zl5l5/can_anyone_suggest_interesting_content_mods/)

Not interested in stuff like graphics improvements, new skins, new armors, weapons, etc. Prefer things with new quests or NPC interactions, or doing something clever with the engine. Thanks!
