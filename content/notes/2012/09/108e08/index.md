#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Question about the recent events in Ultimates (spoilers within)](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/108e08/question_about_the_recent_events_in_ultimates/)

I'm not an american, and we dont have write-in votes where i'm from, but in the Ultimates, cap wins the election via write in and they know the results immediately (within the same day the ballots were cast). Are they really able to count handwritten votes that quickly in US elections, or is this just a comics thing?
