  "text": "For me, that's a false. Note that being a 'good' programmer is something else though. In addition, what is 'good' here is also subjective.

Ask someone to describe how a traffic light works in great detail, and you'll be surprised - people in a non-it profession who answer that will be pseudocoding already, and not realize it. (You can also use a cooking recipe as an example, if you so wish - that's technically a program too!)",
