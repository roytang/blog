  "text": "I think cop movies here are limited to semibiographica l movies about real life cops (like the Lacson movie I guess). We don&#x27;t really have anything close to the cop movie genre with movies Bad Boys or Lethal Weapon or even Beverly Hills Cop. I reckon the car chase scenes would be too expensive lol",
