[@bitolithic](https://twitter.com/bitolithic/) is there an easy way to upload multiple folders worth of files to comic zeal? Sync app/itunes file sharing only accepts files

[15:42] Should've read up more on ComicZeal before purchasing it, having buyer's remorse. [@bitolithic](https://twitter.com/bitolithic/)

[15:50] @bitolithichelp I realize that, but is there any possibility of an update or workaround in the future?

[15:53] @bitolithichelp would be a big help if I could drag folders to the sync app instead of having to open each folder and drag the files

[16:01] @bitolithichelp thanks for the prompt feedback
