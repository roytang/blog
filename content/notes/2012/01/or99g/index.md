#### Posted on r/ipad: [Regretting my purchase of ComicZeal, is there a way I can get a refund? Also, can anyone recommend alternatives?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/or99g/regretting_my_purchase_of_comiczeal_is_there_a/)

In my previous thread http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/ practically everyone recommended comiczeal, but it doesn't have the easy collection management features I was looking for. Specifically, there doesn't seem to be a way to upload multiple folders' worth of comics at a time (both the sync app and itunes file sharing only accept files, not folders), and no easy way to delete lots of comics at a time (still need to select them individually or something)

Is there a way to ask Apple for a refund because I'm not satisfied with the app? 

Also, can someone recommend any alternatives?

Thanks!
