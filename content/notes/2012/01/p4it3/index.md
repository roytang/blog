#### Posted on r/gaming: [Giving away $5 Amazon promo code, must be used today Jan 31](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/p4it3/giving_away_5_amazon_promo_code_must_be_used/)

Here's the list of games the promo applies to: http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000728511

I don't have anything to get on this list (I would've gotten Shogun Total War if the price had dropped more =/), so I'll just give away the code.

First come, first serve: PHHK-VJGNQ6-F7QGAL

Instructions: To redeem your reward, simply visit http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?docId=1000728511 in January 2012, click "Buy and Download", and enter your promotional code at checkout to receive $5 off your game download.
