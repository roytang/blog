#### Posted on r/gaming: [So, how did your crafting turn out?](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/ny68b/so_how_did_your_crafting_turn_out/)

I just crafted four times and got four X% off Valve coupons. I love it. Anyone want to trade for some other coupons?

Nevertheless, it's been a good sale and christmas hunt. I did get one game from the gift pile (SpaceChem), and bought quite a few cheap ones. 

I hope you guys had a good holiday sale :D
