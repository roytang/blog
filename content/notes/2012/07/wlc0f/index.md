#### Posted on r/techsupport: [I have a Samsung 2233sw monitor, and the menu and brightness dialog on the lower right of the screen won't go away](https://reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/wlc0f/i_have_a_samsung_2233sw_monitor_and_the_menu_and/)

Here's a picture: http://i.imgur.com/DOcPX.jpg (the glare is hiding the brightness bar). I've had this monitor for a while, I guess something is loose? Pressing the menu buttons on the side doesn't help (I can't even adjust the brightness to a value other than 100)

Any ideas for a quick fix aside from taking it to some shop to be repaired? I'd rather not have to open up the monitor.
