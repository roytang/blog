#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Avengers Assemble - is this title set in the main universe or the movie universe?](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/we2nx/avengers_assemble_is_this_title_set_in_the_main/)

I mean, it looks like a main book based on the first few pages with Mockingbird, Wolverine, Ms Marvel, Black Panther, Red Hulk, and other current Avengers on the team, but the cover features the ones who've appeared in the movie only. Also, as far as I know the current green Hulk is bald and intelligent, while the Hulk in this book has hair and seems less intelligent. So...which is it?
