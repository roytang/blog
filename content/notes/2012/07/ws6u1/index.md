#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Has anyone here made top 64 in a GP? I have a question](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/ws6u1/has_anyone_here_made_top_64_in_a_gp_i_have_a/)

I'm just curious how long it takes them to send out the prize money? I placed in a GP a bit more than a month ago (Manila) and they said I'd be receiving some notification by e-mail if the check has been sent out. I'm curious as to when I should expect it.

EDIT: Thanks for the responses! Looks like I have to wait a while more.
