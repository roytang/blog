#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Do you prefer DC's rebooting every N years or Marvel's one big lump of continuity?](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/12e9yl/do_you_prefer_dcs_rebooting_every_n_years_or/)

I understand that having more than 50 years of continuity behind you can create problems for the DC writers, but somehow it feels comforting that most of the Marvel comic book stories I read back in my childhood are still "canon"
