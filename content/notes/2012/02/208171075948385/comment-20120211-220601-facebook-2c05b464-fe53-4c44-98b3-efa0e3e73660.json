  "text": "Only a few of those interest me (mounted combat, spell combinations, dragon mount).     What I'd really like is if the quests were tweaked so that it feels more like people pay attention to what's going on (like, the dialogue for the stormcloak arc should definitely be different if the Emperor is dead; Companions treat you differently if you're already the Archmage, Thieves guild treats you different if you're in the Dark Brotherhood).",
