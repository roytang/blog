#### Posted on r/gaming: [Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, PS3 or PC?](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/pkg9f/kingdoms_of_amalur_reckoning_ps3_or_pc/)

So I've tried both the PS3 and the PC demos. The PC version looks better, but the control scheme seems clunky for the keyboard/mouse (the loot dialog doesn't even seem to have any keyboard shortcuts) and better for the controller. I'm also not too thrilled that the PC version required me to login to my EA account. Any feedback on the full version, is it ok, better than the demo?

Anything else I need to consider in weighing PC vs PS3? Do we expect mod support? Also, if I buy the retail version (off the shelf copies are a lot cheaper than digital downloads where I am), will it be for Steam or Origin or Neither?
