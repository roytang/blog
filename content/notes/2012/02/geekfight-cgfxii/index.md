- HARRY POTTER
- VIDEO GAMES
- '90S ANIME
- DISNEY
- SCI-FI TV
- ACADEMY AWARDS

This was one of those rare occasions where we had so many people we had to split into two teams.

I don't think we won but apparently Camote Bleu (our team) did better than Camote Golde because there was a pizza bet and we discussed them buying us pizza afterwards.
