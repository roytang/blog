These are very busy bots, you might have to spam them for trade for a while.\n\nAlso, MTGOTrader and MarlonMTGO both have linked bots with large stocks at reasonable prices that you can search through with your webbrowser (just google those names, if curious) Delver @ .07 and Vapor Snag @ .04 currently.\n",
