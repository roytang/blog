#### Posted on r/ipad: [Simple question...sending text/links between ipad/pc](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/15a4a2/simple_questionsending_textlinks_between_ipadpc/)

Is there something that makes this easy? Like say I'm browsing something on my PC and I see an image that could be a good ipad wallpaper so I want to send it to my ipad somehow. Or maybe I see something on my ipad and think "I want to view this on my desktop" so I want to send the link there. I don't want to have to do something like send it out via an email, I'm hoping /r/ipad has some sort of mindblowing magic for me.

Edit: probably should have mentioned i dont use a mac
