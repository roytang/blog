[@Woerlan](https://twitter.com/Woerlan/) I find only a few titles to be that good. I really only follow the Batman/GL books. I heard WW is good, but thats in my backlog

[@Woerlan](https://twitter.com/Woerlan/) it's ridiculous that they're removing [@GailSimone](https://twitter.com/GailSimone/) from Batgirl when that's been selling better than series like Teen Titans, Flash

[@Woerlan](https://twitter.com/Woerlan/) not even Justice League is very exciting. Hopefully New 52 gets a shot in the arm when JLA launches next year
