#### Posted on r/truegaming: [Why haven't there been any Mario-level platformers outside of Nintendo?](https://reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/14josh/why_havent_there_been_any_mariolevel_platformers/)

I'm asking about this because I have friends who got the WiiU simply because none of the other consoles has a Mario game. Sony has Little Big Planet trying to be the platformer of choice for the PS3/Vita, but that doesn't really seem to come close to the Mario experience. Xbox has...well I don't even know if there are platformers on Xbox. If you really want to play Mario or something that provides a reasonably close experience, are you really forced to go Nintendo?
