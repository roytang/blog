#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [[mtgo] Are you annoyed by people who complain about the shuffler?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/15lpfb/mtgo_are_you_annoyed_by_people_who_complain_about/)

Seriously, there's always people around who blame their losses on the shuffler or to mana screw. It's like deck building and mulliganing decisions aren't relevant. A lot of people don't understand randomness either - people complain about not having mana screw runs in real life compared to mtgo are often unaware of their own negative bias and most probably are not sufficiently randomizing their decks in real life. 

Earlier, there was this guy complaining to me about mana screw and I was like "dude I have 3 lands to your 6". And he replied that at least I was casting my spells. Well maybe I had a smaller curve and only two colors (he had 4 colors of land out by the time the game ended) and I kept my hand even with 2 lands because it already had 3 two-drops. When your opening hand is 2 forests, a green card and 3 white cards and you think to yourself "Surely I'll draw a plains!" then you don't draw one for seven turns, that's not really mana screw, that was a bad keep.

Sigh, sorry about the rant. I just hate it when people complain so much about the same things. (Yet they still keep coming back to play magic)
