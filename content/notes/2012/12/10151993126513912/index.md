Okay, I dreamt I was in a client meeting for a software project, except that the client was an alien who looked a bit like Jabba the Hutt and kept insulting us for being earthlings. He was asking us why we were using Java when it had restrictions for export outside the US. As the lead technical guy I had to explain that the restrictions only applied to certain countries and to certain parts of Java and that we wouldn't be using those parts, etc.   Also, my sleep cycle is completely out of whack
