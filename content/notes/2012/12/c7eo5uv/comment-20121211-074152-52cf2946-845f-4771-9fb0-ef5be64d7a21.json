  "text": "Like I said, that specific case is really not a great example. If it's clear, from investigation on the scene, that you were unaware of your trigger, I don't think anyone *should* have a problem with saying you missed it.\n\nAnd that is something judges can establish fairly easily, usually through asking a couple useful questions (like \"so, when you sat there saying nothing for ten seconds, what did you think was going on in the game?\").\n\nThe problem is when people confuse that for a ruling that a trigger was missed due to failure to announce it.",
