Emman Javier How do you plan to motivate people to change?  "Well, I don't really know the old system, but in motivating people to do their work I think the most important thing is to make the direction clear to them. And, what you expect out of them in terms of this direction. The reason why people are not motivated is because they don't know what it's all about."  - Col. Fermin P. Javier
