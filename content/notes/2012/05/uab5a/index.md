#### Posted on r/Jokes: [A woman is pregnant with twins when she gets into a car accident...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/uab5a/a_woman_is_pregnant_with_twins_when_she_gets_into/)

...she wakes up in the hospital and the doctor says her twins have already been delivered, a boy and a girl. But since she wasn't around to name them, they had to ask her brother to give them legal names.

The woman was worried, because her brother was a bit of an idiot. "What did he name them?" she asked.

"He named the girl Denise," the doctor said.

"Oh, that's a nice name," she said in relief. "What did he name the boy?"

"Denephew."
