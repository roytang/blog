3rd pack Angel of Serenity when you're drafting Rakdos, that's #MTG

<time>[09:40]</time> I had the chance to golgari charm the turn 2 pack rats and I was like "he's not going to activate it until my next untap right?" WRONG #mtg

<time>[09:44]</time> Even worse I was down a game &amp; he had 5 mins left on the clock. Killing the rat left him no way to win, but no i wanted to be aggro #mtg
