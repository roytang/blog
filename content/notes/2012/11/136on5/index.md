#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Anyone else really enjoy All-new X-Men #1? (spoilery maybe)](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/136on5/anyone_else_really_enjoy_allnew_xmen_1_spoilery/)

The art was a blast and I like the way everything was set up. I'm hoping Hank's new mutation involves time travel lol. Him going back to ask the young 'uns to come forward hopefully means we don't get a mindless misunderstanding when the kids make it to the present day. 

I'm looking forward to the next issue!
