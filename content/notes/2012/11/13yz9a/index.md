#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [What are the best examples of Batman being the world's greatest detective?](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/13yz9a/what_are_the_best_examples_of_batman_being_the/)

I had this discussion with a friend who was mainly exposed to batman through the movies, and I said that the detective aspect isnt played up very much in the films. What stories can i recommend to him that show the more detective side of batman?
