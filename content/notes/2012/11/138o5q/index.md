#### Posted on r/Games: [Why haven't we seen a D&D 4th edition CRPG?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/138o5q/why_havent_we_seen_a_dd_4th_edition_crpg/)

Just curious. I remember when browsing through the 4E manuals I thought they'd made the systems much better for games in particular so I'm surprised there haven't been any 4E CRPGs.
