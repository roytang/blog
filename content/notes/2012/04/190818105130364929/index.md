Photos c/o GeekFight! Trivia Night

Happenings:

- early on in the geekfight, one of the girls in the back teams had written "CALL ME 0919-NNNNNNN" on the whiteboard and the crowd was like egging him on
- one of the teams was writing stuff on their whiteboards like "WAIT 3 DAYS BEFORE CALLING HER BRO", "SUIT UP", "AVENGERS IS THE BEST FIRST DATE MOVIE"
- the crowd kept teasing him all night
- tapos at the end of the geek fight, he pops the "extra question", asking another girl if she would be his girlfriend
- wala lang, sabi namin kawawa naman ung other girl haha
- meron pa habang nagsasalita sya, may nagabot sa kanya ng slip of paper
- and the crowd was like "Another number?!? Scorers!"
