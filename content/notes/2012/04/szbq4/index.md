#### Posted on r/AndroidQuestions: [Android noob here; I just got an LG C660 and have a question](https://reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/szbq4/android_noob_here_i_just_got_an_lg_c660_and_have/)

The phone is from my brother, though I've done a reset to clear his data from the phone. It's an LG Optimus Pro c660 with Cyanogen something installed (it's like a custom OS build right?) it says it's android 2.3 somewhere

My question is: I tried downloading some apps like Google Goggles and Instagram, but the Play store tells me those apps are not compatible with the device. Is this sort of thing a restriction of the phone, or the particular OS version I have? 

Thanks!
