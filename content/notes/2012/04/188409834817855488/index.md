Okay, so I decided to try out the MTGO cube https://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/739/fa5.jpg

Seriously, I have no idea what I'm doing. The first pack I opened had 3 mythics~ Holy crap that Taiga looks nice 

I had to cut a titan from my deck. This feels so ridiculous lol

Felt great keeping a one-lander, turn one Ancestral Visions, then going on to win the game

I'm glad I only have to fight annoying deck with top once per #mtgocube
