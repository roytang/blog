#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Question about the new 52 Robins](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/y9i12/question_about_the_new_52_robins/)

Do we know their current ages and when they became Robin, and for how long? I mean, I know Damian is ten years old right now. And Dick is always drawn like he's maybe 21 or something? But given that Dick started being Robin at around 9 or 10, that means Batman has been Batman for more than a decade?

Obviously it's all "comic book time", but I just want to get an idea of how long ago and for what duration each of them (Dick, Jason, Tim, Damian) were Robin in the New 52 universe.
