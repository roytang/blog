Plagiarism may not be a crime in the Philippines, but neither is "cyber-bullying". Just because it isn't illegal doesn't make it right.

[20:53] People need to stop taking Sotto seriously. Don't expect him to engage you with rational discourse despite being a Senator. He is who he is.

[20:54] Plagiarism is an intellectual/academic issue, not appreciated by the masses - that's his audience, not any of us on Twitter or Facebook.
