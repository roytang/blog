  "text": "It&#x27;s always worse. The population grew and is growing faster than urban planning can handle. Even without the floods, today&#x27;s traffic is terrible... and that&#x27;s with the 16+ year lag from a child being born to having to start commuting to and from work. The infrastructure can&#x27;t handle it.     It would be different if we were a really rich country that can afford giant public projects (a true subway system that covers 80% of NCR rather than just a few LRT/MRT lines; a computerized traffic system with dynamic load-balancing rather than relying on timed lights and lots of inefficient u-turns; giant underground spillways to prevent flooding, etc). But we&#x27;re not. Even if our population growth dropped to zero now, the traffic will still grow over the next 20 years that today&#x27;s babies and kids start working/ polluting (independently of their families), before it reached a steady state that would let infrastructure catch up.",
