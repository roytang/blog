  "text": "Do I send myself back and take the place of my younger self or just appear in the past as a chrono-intruder ?    If it&#x27;s choice A, sure! I&#x27;d take a redo and see what happens. If it&#x27;s B, enh, that&#x27;s a bit pointless. I&#x27;d have to stay in the past to make use of my future knowledge; if I return to the future, either I annihilate myself because I would have ended up a different person, or it&#x27;s an alternate universe anyway, in which case I only changed some other universe that might have been different even without my time travel.",
