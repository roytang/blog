#### Posted on r/AskReddit: [Reddit, have you ever executed a "long troll"? Tell us about it.](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/y55gm/reddit_have_you_ever_executed_a_long_troll_tell/)

<time>[21:17]</time> Here's mine:

A few months after I started working at my current company, I lost my eyeglasses during a weekend trip to my dad's hometown. When one of the senior employees asked me about it, I made up a story about how we had gone back to the old hometown and there I met up with my childhood friend and rival. This rival and I had a tradition of competitiveness and every time I went back there we would do some ridiculous contest, and this time we had decided on a swimming contest at the nearby beach. During the swim, I cramped up and had to be saved by my rival, but in the process my eyeglasses fell into the sea.

Now, the rival part was made up, but it was completely true that I had lost my glasses while swimming at that beach (don't ask me why I was swimming with glasses on). I didn't really know many people back there since it was my dad's hometown not mine.

About a year later, when it was summer again, the same senior employee asked me if I was going to go back there and meet up with my "rival" again. Without missing a beat I told her that my rival had died during the previous year and therefore last year's competition was the last. Well, I couldn't kept my face straight for very long and eventually caved and told her about it after she started questioning some of my BS details :p

TLDR - told one of my officemates a made up story about a childhood rival and a year later she still hadn't realized I was making it up
