  HOW TO FIX THE PHILIPPINES
 </p>
 <p>
  (1) Don't jaywalk. Find the nearest pedestrian crossing or overpass.
  <br/>
  (2) Pay your taxes on time and in full REGARDLESS of whether it will go to crooks because if you don't pay your taxes you are a crook. BTW, this is why you should have registered and voted.
  <br/>
  (3) Donate to the charity of your choice, or even better volunteer and lead projects.
  <br/>
  (4) Don't knowingly plagiarize anything yourself. Be sure to mention you heard about it from a friend or saw it on the internet.
  <br/>
  (5) When discussing sensitive issues such as politics or religion, respect the other person's view point and disagree with them intelligently.
  <br/>
  (6) Never be rude to people who are not "important". Everyone is important to someone.
  <br/>
  (7) Be grateful we live in a country where we have civil liberties, we do not cane our children in public, we have never had a major famine, and women have a right to education and to vote.
  <br/>
  (8) Never complain about the Philippines without doing something about it.
  <br/>
  (9) Be a good ambassador for the country, whether at home or abroad. Acknowledge that our country has problems but don't ever tell them it's hopeless or how much you hate it or how glad you are that you left. If that's the way you feel, please feel free to call yourself an American. A Filipino is someone who cares about the Philippines.
  <br/>
  (10) Make a difference by being the difference. In the end, it's all up to us. We can't count on "them" to make a better country. We can only count on each other.
 </p>
 <p>
  If you don't actually practice what you preach or what you post, then please spare me your beautiful tumblr photo or infographic. Put up or shut up.
