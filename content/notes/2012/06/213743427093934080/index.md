For everyone  going into battle at GP Manila today: Relax, have fun, be lucky. :D

[09:01] Looks like around 1200 at gp manila lots more than I expected

[12:14] Started out 3-0 now the hard part begins #gpmnl

[18:35] Now at 6-2, must win the final round to advance to day 2 #gpmanila

[19:56] Aw crap, i'm playing tomorrow. It's my first gp day 2! #achievementunlocked #gpmanila

[19:59] I'm not cut out for nine rounds anymore, my brain is already jelly.

[22:41] Salamat po sa mga supporters at sa mga bumati sa twitter (showbiz), pero wala pa po akong napapanalunan. Naiwasan ko lang maeliminate lol

[22:49] Exhausted after a whole day of Magic at GP Manila, but I finally managed to make day 2 of a GP. The battle continues tomorrow!
