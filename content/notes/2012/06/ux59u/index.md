#### Posted on r/PS3: [Anyone here tried replacing their PS3 HDD? I have some questions](https://reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/ux59u/anyone_here_tried_replacing_their_ps3_hdd_i_have/)

I have a 500 GB WD external HDD, and a friend told me I could take it out of it's case and use it as the replacement HDD for the PS3. Can someone confirm that this will work? (I don't want to take apart the drive just to find out it won't work with the PS3). 

All the youtube guides I've seen are saying to get a laptop hard drive but those are more expensive and I already have this external available.

Thanks!
