Awaiting the first round of day 2. Relax, good luck, have fun

Lost the 11th round, now at 8-3. #GPManila so much for top8 lol

Got lucky vs solar flare to finish the gp at 11-4, should be in the money. The other 5 rounds were vs delver @_@ #GPManila

My only sustenance for the past 12 hours was a bottle of mineral water and a kfc brownie from yesterday

@magicprotour  what's up with people turning into zombies in the event coverage? https://imageshack.com/ lol #GPManila

My final standing at GP Manila was 39th: http://twitpic.com/9xg2ht
