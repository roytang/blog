So I took a train trip to Bicol via the Bicol Express. I was really impressed with the cheap fares, the speed of the train and the excellent service and convenience at the station. It had cost me less than a hundred pesos for the entire trip and I didn't even need to bring my wallet or anything (though I had my id).  I was back home by the evening of the same day and gushing about how great the trip was. Then I woke up and found that it was just a dream. That was so disappointing =/
