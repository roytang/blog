  "text": "They are separate events, but triggered effects don't go on the stack until one of the players gains priority, and then they all go on the stack at the same time for each player. The sequence here goes something like:\n\nDamage is dealt\n\nState-based effects are checked, sending tokens and Obliterator to the GY (they \"die\")\n\nActive player gains priority, all pending effects that triggered from the previous effects go on the stack (active player's effects first, then opponent's)",
