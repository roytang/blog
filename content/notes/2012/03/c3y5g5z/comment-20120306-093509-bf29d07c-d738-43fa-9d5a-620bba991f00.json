  "text": "Hardly. Console exclusives in fighting games can fuck up competition. The PS3 version won't be allowed, or at any rate the extra characters in it will be banned for competitive play. They could be the most fun and refreshing characters to grace a fighting game, but because there is console exclusivity they won't be allowed to be played.\n\nI'm sick of people trying to be smug by making blanket statements, especially this whole \"entitlement\" deal.
