#### Posted on r/PS4: [Infamous: Second Son - is it more than just a pretty face?](https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/21qlim/infamous_second_son_is_it_more_than_just_a_pretty/)

Considering getting a PS4 because of all the very nice Infamous:SS screen shots going around, but is the game more than just a pretty face?

I'm a bit bothered by the Kill Screen review: http://killscreendaily.com/articles/reviews/infamous-second-son-shows-what-ps4-capable-and-nothing-more/

I finished Infamous 1 but not Infamous 2 coz I kind of got bored with it being more of the same. Would I get bored with SS after admiring the pretty graphics for a while?
