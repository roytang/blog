It's actually kind of amazing that despite all the modern technology and air safety stuff, nobody still has any real idea what happened to the Malaysian Airlines flight after more than a week. I wonder if we'll ever know what happened or if it's going to turn out to be something like Amelia Earhart's disappearance where people will still be speculating about it decades from now
