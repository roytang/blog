So I just caught up with Arrow. Great show, especially for comic fans, but something bothers me. (Arrow spoilers follow)  ...  ...  ...  So Sarah Lance is alive and is Black Canary. And her father Police Officer (formerly detective) Lance knows that she and Oliver are dating. And he also knows that Sarah is Black Canary. And he knows that Arrow and Black Canary are working together. Yet he can't put two and two together! This is why he shouldn't be a detective lol
