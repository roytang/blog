  "text": "I really like the concept of Basic Income, but I need to see some numbers to justify that it will be \"cheaper\" to implement than the welfare state. (And of course, since the example and most of the numbers are from the USA, let's continue using that).    I understand the theory, but are the costs of the welfare state really that large specifically due to targeting and searching bureaucracy? No one has statistics on that except the government.     You'd have to provide more \"welfare money\" (okay, it's not welfare, but it's the same principle) for a specifically larger population, constantly.    I believe that basic income costs > savings on bureaucracy.    ----    Also, a lot of businesses that are \"in it for the money\" will be taxed significantly. Is the underlying notion that taxes will remain the same? It seems like the majority of tax burden will go to the property /  company owners. This will discourage the same large-scale venture capitalism that fuels our, however lopsided, economy, while encouraging small-scale entrepreneurship.  Are we prepared to make the transition that there will be less people \"dreaming big\" and paying huge taxes? There are supposedly savings with minimum wage laws, but, again, numbers are needed to ensure that those who dream big are not sufficiently discouraged from doing so. They will be the prime generation of wealth that will be distributed to everyone.",
