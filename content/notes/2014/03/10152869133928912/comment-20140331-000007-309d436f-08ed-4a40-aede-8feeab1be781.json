In addition to this, on third day, taster N+1, N+2, N+3 will drink xxN. This is to narrow down the case when for example taster 0 dies on first day taster 1 dies on second day. The final digit is determined by some other people dying. If 010, taster 2 and 3 must die. If 011, taster 2 3 4 must die.    Correction: should be up to N+4",
