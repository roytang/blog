  "text": "The binary solution (as implied by AJ) is as follows (spacing for spoilers):     ...    ...    ...    You assign each barrel a binary string according to their barrel number like so:  1 0000000001  2 0000000010  3 0000000011  4 0000000100  5 0000000101  6 0000000110  7 0000000111  ...and so on    Wine taster #1 takes a sip of wine from each barrel that has a 1 in the right-most digit.  Wine taster #2 takes a sip of wine from each barrel that has a 1 in the second right-most digit.  Wine taster #3 takes a sip of wine from each barrel that has a 1 in the third right-most digit.  ...and so on    After 7 days, some number of the tasters will die. You compose a binary string ordered by the taster for each place value. For each one that dies, you put a 1. Each one that lives gets a 0. The binary string you formed now corresponds to the barrel number that is poisoned.     For example, if taster #2 and taster #3 are the only ones that died, your binary string would be 0000000110, which means barrel #6 is the poisoned barrel.    This scheme is also fair to the wine tasters, they each have roughly 50% chance to survive. (Some might have slightly higher odds due to there being less than 1024 barrels)",
