So I marathoned Gurren Lagann this weekend. That was totally not what I expectd lol. It was fun and way over the top, even though it still hit a lot of the tropes. I thought it was going to get boring after the timeskip, but nope. It got a little weird at the end, but I guess that's inevitable when things escalate quickly
