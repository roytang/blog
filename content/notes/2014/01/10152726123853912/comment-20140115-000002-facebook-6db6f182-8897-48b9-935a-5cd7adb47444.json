  "text": "The US has several times the naval military power of China. If they took it seriously enough, they could send multiple carriers to the disputed zone. Would that help? Probably not much...    I don't think it would help if the multiple non-Chinese warships were instead owned by Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, etc, either, really.    Lend-lease isn't a bad idea, but I don't think it would be worth it to us unless there was a serious chance at war. Those ships are EXPENSIVE to run and maintain. And the article talks blithely about US carriers being run by the likes of us.... I'm sure they're really thinking about India, Japan and Korea, who could actually afford the ridiculous cost and the accompanying fighter jets.     As for us, we'd have endless protests just from the nuclear power plant on a carrier, never mind the cost of keeping thousands of sailors at sea for many months at a time, and the accompanying fleet of support ships required for each carrier. Even if the purchase price is deferred, the maintenance and support costs won't be!    We can't even keep our existing machines in good shape as it is!",
