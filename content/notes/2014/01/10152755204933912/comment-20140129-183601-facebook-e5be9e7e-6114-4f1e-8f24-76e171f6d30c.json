  "text": "I've only used Google docs for a little bit, so I can't give a decent opinion on it.    But OpenOffice is definitely a meh product. It's okay and something one puts up with if one wants to not spend money, but it's gotten bloated trying to keep up with MS Office features and compatibility, so it has no advantages and has distinct disadvantages, especially for displaying some things that don't turn out right.    If they want a free good-quality thing for producing professional-lo oking documents, they might as well use LaTeX (though that in turn takes more time to learn). Otherwise, I think they should stick with MS Office.    Reading the article, it seems to be less about MS Office and more about switching to custom software produced by small companies as opposed to the giants, which is probably a good idea a lot of the time.",
