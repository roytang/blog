The folders are arranged according to which ones I often use (most used go to the bottom since they are easily accessible via thumbs). If I have apps that I use often, I either keep them out of the folders (Waze) or put them together in a folder of their own near the thumbs (Games, Admin tools).    &quot;Most used&quot; can be a category too you know.",
