Finished Dragon Age: Inquisition today. Almost 80 hours playtime, did almost every quest (except a few hidden maps) and completed stuff like the shards and the high dragons. Skipped completing the more annoying completionist stuff (regions, mosaic pieces, etc). The game isn't exceptional and the combat isn't too tough on Normal, but there's a lot of Dragon Age lore behind it, there's a heck of a lot of stuff to do, and it's good enough for fans of the series.
