If you&#x27;re after a bulk purchase, try out your average toy store (toys r us, toy kingdom), and then look for the game set that sells you 6 white d6s and a plastic container to roll them with. I forget the game name, but it&#x27;s something like a betting game where you attempt to select the number of pips that come up from 6 dice. Terrible game, but good source of &quot;normal-sized&quot; d6s for around 100 php.",
