He could conceivably use his super vision to find an asteroid full of platinum, and then he&#x27;d have the strength to retrieve the whole thing himself.    He could become the greatest surgeon in the world. He would be able to diagnose people by just looking at them, and possibly do surgery on them with just his eye beams.     With Superman&#x27;s powers, I could get wealthy just by turning a crank that generates power  =P    I could easily be richer than Bill Gates, then just hire wise men. And in my spare time, do wth I want without having to worry about people trying to kidnap me for ransom or even that my private jet might crash as I fly for my monthly Kobe beef dinner, in Kobe.",
