Or maybe an ex of yours uses one of your real texts to falsely accuse you of being a spammer just to spite you. IDK all the ways anonymous reporting can be abused, but like I said, if I was accused of being a spammer, I'd want to know who is accusing me and the details. There's probably a reason why in criminal law, defendants are accorded the right to know the details of the accusation and to face their accuser [@arnelc24](https://twitter.com/arnelc24/) [@wawam](https://twitter.com/wawam/) [@yusufledesma](https://twitter.com/yusufledesma/) [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/)",
