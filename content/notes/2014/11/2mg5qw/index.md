#### Posted on r/PS4: [Mic volume too low when capturing video](https://reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/2mg5qw/mic_volume_too_low_when_capturing_video/)

Hello. I tried capturing a gameplay video using the PS4 and I tried using this mic+earphone that came with the unit/dualshock 4, but the mic volume in the video is really poor. I can't find any setting to adjust the mic volume, is there a way? Or is it more likely that the mic has a problem?
