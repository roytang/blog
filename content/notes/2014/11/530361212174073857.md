[@pastor_ey](https://twitter.com/pastor_ey/) [@momblogger](https://twitter.com/momblogger/) [@wawam](https://twitter.com/wawam/) of course in no way do I support spammers, but as a matter of common sense I like to take into account other POVs and understand why policies are in place. And note that they only disclose your number if there is a dispute. I have been reporting on average 3-5 spam messages per week for the past few months and have never received a dispute. Again, it seems like a perfectly reasonable policy to me. [@arnelc24](https://twitter.com/arnelc24/) [@yusufledesma](https://twitter.com/yusufledesma/) [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/)
