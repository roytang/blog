[@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) here are some recent spam messages https://imgur.com/a/MspLl

@ToniOfGlobe before I agree, can I ask if my # will only be revealed if the spammer comes forward personally? Will their number be disabled?

@ToniOfGlobe I mean, they would have to give their real name etc?

@ToniOfGlobe yes, but will you disclose my number if they don't disclose their own details?

@ToniOfGlobe I'm just confirming that "denied the report" means they disclose their own details to do that. If so, I'm fine with it

@ToniOfGlobe btw, will I be notified if the spammer disputes the report?

@YanyanOfGlobe and will I be notified if the spammer disputes?

@YanyanOfGlobe you're not answering my question :|

@YanyanOfGlobe how does that answer my question?
