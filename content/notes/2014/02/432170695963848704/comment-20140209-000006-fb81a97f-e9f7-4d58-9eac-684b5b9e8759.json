It&#x27;s Macross Frontier  =P    It&#x27;s been 20 years since I&#x27;ve read Ender&#x27;s Game, I think, but just about everything Ender&#x27;s Game took up as a theme was done in Macross Frontier.    Alien bugs that aren&#x27;t really hostile.  Almost telepathic connection with the hero(es).  The young recruited early as soldiers.  Manipulative authority.  Mentor types.  Genocide theme.  Leadership/ finding oneself/ maturation in extreme circumstances.",
