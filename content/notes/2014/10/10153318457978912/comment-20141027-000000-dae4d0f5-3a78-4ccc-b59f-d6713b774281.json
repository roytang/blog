It&#x27;s like Firaxis was a story writing and mod team that focused more on the graphics and text-stories more than the mechanics and testing.    Certain strats are imba now (internal trade routes, picking affinity by your nearby resources, going for science / prod / health tactics), and the AI has never been more unreasonable. UI took a hit too, with even non-colorblind people complaining that miasma gas is nigh visible against alien grassland. The tech web, while a nice feature, is UI hell that they need to patch.    Recommend to wait for the first set of patches before getting.",
