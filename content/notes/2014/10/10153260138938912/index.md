Back in Manila after almost a week out of the country. The Metro Manila rain last night was so bad, it reached across the seas and delayed our flight for almost 3 hours, I guess para daw makiramay kami sa traffic ng Metro Manila. Singapore/Malaysia was fun, although being a tourist is exhausting and hard on the legs. At least I'm not yet working until next Tuesday (in theory)
