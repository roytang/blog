#### Posted on r/spikes: [[Standard] Any tips for the Jeskai Wins vs Abzan midrange matchups post-board?](https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/2j132u/standard_any_tips_for_the_jeskai_wins_vs_abzan/)

Game 1 seems easier because Thoughtseize + painlands deal them a bunch of free damage

Post-board, should you be aiming to be the aggressor, or go for the long grindy game?

What do you board out? I'm thinking something like Seekers and Magma Jets and probably Steam Augury out, and bringing in some combination of Negate, Disdainful Stroke, Erase (if they have Whip/Banishing Light/Herald of Torment). Should I consider Keranos and go for the long game? I've also tried boarding in Narset, but havent had a chance to actually cast it, not sure how good it is in the match up.

I'm also thinking about playing some Glare of Heresy in the board. Answers Rhino, Sorin/Elspeth/Ajani, Banishing Light, Fleecemane Lion, Wingmate Roc. What do you guys think?

Siege Rhino by itself isnt actually too bad, since you can still try to race it. The problem is when it comes with Sorin and/or a Whip, then the lifelink makes things tough. I'm also wary of Fleecemanes, it seems you need to kill them before they get a chance to go monstrous; once they're monstrous you don't have easy answers
