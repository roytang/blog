I'm all for these kinds of advancements, but in my head I can see a possible doomsday scenario where a genetically engineered cell has an unforeseeen consequence that mutates it into a fast-spreading virus that threatens all of humanity. At least these guys are scientists and not engineers, which means they need to validate their results empirically. If science was done the way software engineering was done, I guess we'd have a lot more to worry about ðŸ˜›
