Watched X-Men: Days of Future Past at Trinoma.

Nitpicks from group chats:

- Will the white house really fit inside a baseball stadium?!? Tt was an impressive scene, but I disbelieve that a baseball stadium is that big.
- The other problem with the movie was that if Mystique got captured after killing Trask, then x1 and x2 couldn't have happened.
