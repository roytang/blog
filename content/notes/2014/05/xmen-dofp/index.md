Watched X-Men: Days of Future Past at Trinoma.

<time>[2014-05-24, 00:55]</time> As an X-Men fan, I really liked Days of Future Past. Bryan Singer set out to correct the mistakes of the past (literally), and he delivered, and the payoff at the end was great. This was the X-Men movie we deserved! Here, have some more X-Men:

Nitpicks from group chats:

- Will the white house really fit inside a baseball stadium?!? Tt was an impressive scene, but I disbelieve that a baseball stadium is that big.
- The other problem with the movie was that if Mystique got captured after killing Trask, then x1 and x2 couldn't have happened.
