I'm tempted by the Divinity: Original Sin CE (there's a lot of stuff!): http://www.destructoid.com/divinity-original-sin-collector-s-edition-detailed-275007.phtml Sadly, it's not likely that any of the local stores will have these, and having it shipped here would subject me to horrendous customs taxes
