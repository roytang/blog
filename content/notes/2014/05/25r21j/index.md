#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Those of you who are twitter users, what's a good MTG-related twitter list to follow?](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/25r21j/those_of_you_who_are_twitter_users_whats_a_good/)

I used to follow mulldrifting's MTGPlayers list, but that seems to have been removed, does anyone have any suggestions?

Edit: To be clear, I don't want to follow them one by one, I want to use Twitter's existing lists feature where I can subscribe to a list maintained by someone else.
