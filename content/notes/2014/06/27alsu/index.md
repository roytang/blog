#### Posted on r/spikes: [[Modern] UWR Geist?](https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/27alsu/modern_uwr_geist/)

Hi, I'm looking to get into Modern (mostly because we have a PTQ in a few weeks), and I've been checking some decklists and I already have most of the cards for UWR Geist (based on some decklists off the Top Modern Decks from PT:BOTG)

Is this deck currently well-positioned? Looking at recent MTGO event results, most of the UWR decks are the more controllish types without Geist.

Is there a good primer I can read somewhere, something that tells me what are the good/bad matchups, sideboard choices, etc?
