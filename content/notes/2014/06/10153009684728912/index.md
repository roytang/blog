Just watched Savescumming the movie...er, I mean Edge of Tomorrow. Fun movie, but the last 3 minutes made no sense

<time>[2014-06-08 01:15]</time> It would be great if they made a sequel to Edge of Tomorrow and it starts with Tom Cruise dying of old age in a hospital, then after that it's the exact same movie #livedierepeat
