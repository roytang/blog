  "text": "I do. Played every COD since Modern Warfare.. What can I say? I like the gameplay, it's something I can consistently play with the same friends for 7+ years. I'm not afraid to admit it, and I am going to guess there are many others like me that like to play also since it's still one of the best selling series every year.  I know it's shamed upon around here for people to like Call of Duty, but I like it.  ",
