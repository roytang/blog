#### Posted on r/cscareerquestions: [Developers working full-time for software companies, how is your performance evaluated?](https://reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/29eb3e/developers_working_fulltime_for_software/)

Not sure if this is the best place to ask this, feel free to suggest any other subreddit where it would be more appropriate

Developer productivity isn't exactly an easy thing to measure, do performance evaluations of developers tend to be more subjective?

I've heard that some companies evaluate by setting set objectives at the start of the year/evaluation period. How does that work for senior developers whose responsibilities shift a lot? 

How do the big companies (Google, MS, Amazon, etc) do it?
