  "text": "I'm not sure having the games also available on PC/console is a good argument; for me the main draw of the handheld is mobility - I find myself more likely to play the random indie game or something like Spelunky when I'm waiting in line somewhere. If I had them on console/PC they're much likely to remain unplayed (I have better things to do/play if I have a PC)",
