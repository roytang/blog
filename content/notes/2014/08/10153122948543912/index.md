<time>[Jul 31, 2015 21:21]</time> Watched Guardians of the Galaxy. Aaaah aaaah aaaah hooked on a feeling

Guardians was a very funny and fun movie, but it's hard to say best Marvel movie so far, since I really liked Winter Soldier. And as a comic fan, I'm not that fond of how the Nova Corps was portrayed; I guess it's understandable since they're not the heroes here. There's a lot of stuff for comic fans to enjoy though
