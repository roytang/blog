#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [I'm planning to play Standard (competitively) again once Khans rotates in. What Theros block staples would be good to stock up on now?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/2f245s/im_planning_to_play_standard_competitively_again/)

Obviously we have no idea what the meta will be post-rotation, but I'm wondering if there are any cards that are good to get now that are sure to hold value. I'm leaning towards Green - Sylvan Caryatid and Courser of Kuphrix seem like good choices. Anything else?

Edit: I already have Thoughtseizes. From Lorwyn lol.
