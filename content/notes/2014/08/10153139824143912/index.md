Today's WTF dream: I dreamt that I was doing code review for a newbie to our project and it turned out that the newbie was a white-haired old caucasian guy, and he was having trouble with integrating his create screen with our workflow engine. I saw what he was doing wrong and was about to point him to the documentation that tells him the correct function calls to make but then he pulls me aside and whispers, "You have to talk to me VERY SLOWLY. It takes me a while to understand all these technical things" and I was like "Oooookaaaaay"
