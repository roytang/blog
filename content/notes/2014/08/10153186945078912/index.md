I don't know who he was expecting to fool. Anyone who takes the MRT on a regular basis would surely NOT take this seriously. Abaya has to be one of the most incompetent members of the current cabinet; instead of giving us any reasonable explanation for why the MRT is the clusterfuck that it is, he's all excuses and PR shenanigans like this. As far as I can tell there is no reasonable action plan to mitigate the MRT problems and the looming traffic armageddon.
