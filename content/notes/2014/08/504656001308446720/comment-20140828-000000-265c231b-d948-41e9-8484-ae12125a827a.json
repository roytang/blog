It would be cool if it happens to Ippo while he&#x27;s young, so the story can explore this aspect of combat sports in a different way than Rocky.    What am I saying, it&#x27;s a comedy manga too. Never gonna happen  =P    I&#x27;m just hoping they make Ippo learn some fricking defense. His defense only works against random mobs--every boss fight he basically takes brain damage.",
