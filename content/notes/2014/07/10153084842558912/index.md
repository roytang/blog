Today's bad webapps pet peeve: a certain bank's online banking site did not inform me my account would be locked if I failed login too many times (not even a warning on the last attempt); apparently I'm not supposed to copy-paste the password from the reset email into the password field; and worst of all, they require me to use Internet Explorer! (ಠ_ಠ) Was your webapp built in 2005?
