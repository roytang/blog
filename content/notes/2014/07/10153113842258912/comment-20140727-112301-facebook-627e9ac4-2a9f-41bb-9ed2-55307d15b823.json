  "text": "Well, the costume is okay, except for the dumb heels. Batman looks badly photoshopped in--his head and torso look so much bigger than Superman's and yet he's behind Superman and shorter. Yes, sad, sad Batman.    The Gal Gadot factor: she is a lot skinnier than my imagined ideal WW. I mean she looks scrawny, like an ordinary model. I wish they'd made her lift serious weights so she was as buff as Jessica Biel in Blade Trinity.",
