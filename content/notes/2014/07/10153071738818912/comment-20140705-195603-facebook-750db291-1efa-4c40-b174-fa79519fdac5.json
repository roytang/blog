Eventually, even though it's a pretty weak class, I picked a rogue for one of my player characters. It's... pretty sucky in combat, but the invisibility makes it trivial to steal everything.     I think I need to just give up on trying to make backstab work and just use a bow. The backstab damage doesn't even match a 2h fighter's upfront damage, and it's tough to get into backstab position, since you don't want to have the rogue too far away from the rest of the party (or it will be killed once combat starts and it breaks stealth to backstab), and a lot of the time, one wants to open with spells anyway.",
