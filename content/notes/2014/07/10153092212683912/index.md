Literally powerless

<time>[18:41]</time> Still no power, and the darkness is about to set in. At least globe internet seems to be improving

<time>[19:32]</time> Apparently some areas outside the subdivision have power already. I remember back at the old house at Kamias, the house across the street would always get power back before we did

<time>[23:19]</time> Buti pa sa planet of the apes nagkapower na
