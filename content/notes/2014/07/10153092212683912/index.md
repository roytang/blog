Literally powerless

<time>[18:41]</time> Still no power, and the darkness is about to set in. At least globe internet seems to be improving

<time>[19:32]</time> Apparently some areas outside the subdivision have power already. I remember back at the old house at Kamias, the house across the street would always get power back before we did

<time>[23:19]</time> Buti pa sa planet of the apes nagkapower na

<time>[2014-07-17 00:41]</time> Still no power at home and all my batteries are tapped out, going dark. If you need to contact me, wait til I get to the office on the morrow

<time>[2014-07-17 08:07]</time> Still no power at home, recharging at the office. Word is there's a transformer busted at our village and it might take up to a week to restore D:

<time>[2014-07-17 17:32]</time> My knees are jelly

<time>[2014-07-17 18:45]</time> We have power hooray~
