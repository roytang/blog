  title: Mort by Terry Pratchett
---

This week's book was Mort (from the Discworld series). I've read the first few Discworld books, and some of the random later ones, but I figured I should start reading them in order and maybe I'll be finished sometime before I die if Pratchett slows down a bit. I also have a couple of unread physical books in the series, but they're a bit ahead of the sequence. The Discworld books are quick reads anyway (I finished Mort in around three hours while doing other stuff), so it shouldn't take too long, hopefully...
