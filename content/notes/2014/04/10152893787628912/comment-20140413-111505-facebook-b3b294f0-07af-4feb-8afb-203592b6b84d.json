  "text": "Okay, I don't think it's a phishing attempt because this was already the 5th such notification mail I received. I hadn't looked at the others too closely but now that I've checked I found he was applying to different positions in the same company and the cover letter was the same except each one had a different font face and color. The first notification was around two weeks ago. However, the account does not seem to exist (or no longer exists) in jobsdb.com.sg (I tried the forget password link)    This isn't even the first time I've gotten mail meant for someone else. There's also this Malaysian electronics company (I think they're Malaysian) that always cc's me to their invoices when they order stuff like screws and other stuff from some other company. They've been cc'ing me for years. Someday when I feel depressed I'm going to troll them with a reply like \"Why are we ordering this crap? We should get that other stuff!\" or something.",
