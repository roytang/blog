Say what you will about the Game of Thrones TV series, but I really like how they did the battle of Blackwater Bay (yes, I'm still in season 2 playing catch up). Or maybe I just really enjoy watching large-scale medieval warfare, it's far better than reading about it. Looking forward to the big battle in the North towards the end of season 4.
