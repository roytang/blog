I was probably around 80% asleep already when there came an incessant knocking upon my chamber door. I got up and opened the door and there was a little girl just outside the door who promptly demanded that I turn on the lights because she couldn't see anything. As soon as I did so she handed me a Batman toy without explanation and skipped merrily back to the room from whence she came with not a care in the world.  ...now I can't sleep =/
