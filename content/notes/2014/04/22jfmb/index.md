#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Question about Brubaker's Winter Soldier story line](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/22jfmb/question_about_brubakers_winter_soldier_story_line/)

Just finished reading the Man Out of Time and Winter Soldier story arcs of Brubaker's Captain America run.

I wasn't really keeping up with comics back then, how did fans react to Brubaker bringing back Bucky? Did people know ahead of time he was coming back, was it hinted at, or was it a big surprise?
