Currently going through True Detective, it's pretty intense and Matthew Mccgounaghey is barely recognizable. \n\nedit: Also, a note about Parks & Rec season 1, it's widely seen as the weakest of the series since at that time it was still a clone of the Office and the characters haven't been fully formed yet, so don't let it color your perception of the whole series. It's by season 2 when everybody became the characters everybody loved and the show found its identity.",
