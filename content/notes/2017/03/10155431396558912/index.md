So I'm hosting the first Philippine telecoms summit. The goal is to bring internet coverage, speeds and affordability in line with our Asian neighbors. Now I always thought it was just corporate greed that was to blame for our woeful coverage, but here are a few things I picked up so far. 

Internet speeds in the Philippines suck simply because there are not enough towers. Currently, the Philippines has 16,500 cell sites serving 52 million users. That's a ratio of 3,151 users per tower. Average. Meaning in the high density areas, it's most likely worse. By comparison, Vietnam has a ratio of 1 tower for 676 users. 

Private sector (Globe and Smart) have been scrambling to expand their networks but are limited by the following: 

It takes 25 permits and 8 months to build one cell site. That's assuming you don't run into any greedy LGUs.  So in reality, there's either more permits, longer waiting time, or more money changing hands. Then there's revolutionary tax in some areas--where your cell site can be blown up if you don't pay--on top of the 'tower fees' which range 

From 5k to 200k depending on the LGU. 

Now, after putting up your tower (assuming you're now good with the LGU and any rebels that have approached you) homeowner associations are able to have the cell sites removed citing health issues, even if alleged health risks are not substantiated. 

Then there's right of way issues when it comes to laying cables and fiber. According to the industry, not only is this a problem in getting permission, but DPWH operations also cut fiber cables which leads to disruptions. 

All this, plus the fact that we are an archipelago made up of a disputable 7,107 islands, makes the Philippines the second highest in terms of telecommunications infrastructure investment in the world next to China. This infra has been absorbed solely by private sectors with zero investment from the government. 

Now you're probably thinking this is just Smart and Globe hosting their own blaming summit. I did. But this summit is a DICT initiative and all information I just shared with you was presented by government. 

The good news is that there's initiative from the DICT secretary to address this. This summit was his idea to begin with. Gotta give credit for that. Let's just hope and pray that they find these solutions over the 2 days, because reliable internet can have a massive impact on vehicular traffic as people can work and study from home--even if it's  just part time. 

It's 2017 already. Time we looked at new solutions instead of the same old ones. We always talk about infrastructure to minimize traffic, when should also be looking at infostructure. #PhTelecomSummit
