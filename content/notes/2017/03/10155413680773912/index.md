Right. I watched Logan yesterday.

LOGAN Spoiler-Free review:

- great movie. Best of the Wolverine trilogy, easily
- the tone is very different from any previous X-men movies. I'd say it's closer to something like John Wick
- good send-off for Jackman and Stewart, since this is their last movie in these roles. Stewart finally given more acting to do than just sitting in a chair being bald and pretending to think at you
- very, very violent and lots of swearing. Don't bring your kids
- no, it doesn't really follow the Old Man Logan comicbook storyline
- need to listen closely to dialogue to figure out what is implied to have happened to the X-men
- Post-credits scene: I was told there wasn't any, and I really had to pee, so I didn't wait for it -_-
- Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Probably not!
- IMAX or not? I did not go IMAX, and I don't think the movie would have been significantly improved by IMAX or 3d
