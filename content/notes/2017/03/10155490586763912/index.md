So, lawyer friends, a question: Why do court cases take so long in this country? What percentage of it is (a) not enough judges; (b) procedural inefficiencies; (c) incompetent lawyers/prosecutors; (d) corruption; (e) something else?

Is there something being done? I remember reading before that the current SC was instituting some measures to hasten stuff, but there anything effective that been implemented?

(I ask purely out of curiosity, arising from another discussion)
