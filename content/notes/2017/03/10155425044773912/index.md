The writer of this post doesn't make his posts public so I'm CTRL+V&C-ing this,with permission ofcourse. The writer has survived  the regimes of all the past 5 Presidents of this Republic and has been in and out of government all those times.

To my millenial #DDS #Yellowtards #Reds #Rainbows  #Neutrals nudes üòú hahaha friends here on Facebook , I ask a little of your time for you to read this in its entirety. 

________________________________________________

All presidents from Marcos to Duterte used the same playbook in handling dissent. The first and the most important rule is to brand any criticism as destabilization.

Even if someone just wants to overhaul a policy, immediately accuse him of trying to overthrow the government.

Even if someone just wants to change one government rule, paint him as wanting to change the entire government .

Even if someone just wants a nonperforming Cabinet member replaced, fire back by saying : ‚ÄúGusto nyo naman talaga is to replace the government .‚Äù

Why the need for preemptive attack ? Because the rule is never to allow the opposition to gain credibility . By destroying the credibility of the advocate, you destroy whatever advocacy he has .

But what happens when a whistleblower exposes a scam ? Simple. Detonate something more explosive. Kahit dud basta loud. Ang importante not under any circumstance that the charge must get traction. How ? Change the topic , and you shift the public‚Äôs attention away from the embarrassing charge.

Ex : Aguirre was caught with his pants down in the Jack Lam case. How to douse it ? Reopen the Mamasapano case.

PNoy gives his side . Change the topic again, this time on Yolanda funds.

Drug charges against 5 Bilibid drug lords were dropped in exchange for their testimony against De Lima. Before anyone can cry bribery , go to town with the outlandish tale that Jamby and Alonte are offering the drug lords P100 million to recant .

In short, never cede the narrative to the opponent.

So that is what is exactly happening today . A daily battle for domination of the news cycle. An unending tug-of-war over headlines.

Duterte gets hit by the bank account- Lascanas 1-2 punch . Palace dumbfounded. If you noticed, Andanar can only mumble a nonsequitur for an answer .

Tama naman . Kung walang maisagot, huwag sumagot. Do not engage. Better shut your trap and be suspected of being guilty than open it and remove all doubt.

Instead, to make the accusations old news, rebut with an entirely new set of allegations. Hanap nang mas malaking pasabog. Reframe the discussion. Do not be baited into prolonging it.

So ano ang sagot kay Lascanas ? Ikulong si de Lima. Ergo, Lascanas becomes history. Bago magsnowball ang kay Lascanas, shut it down by coming up with a more sensational story.

Itong ganitong modus , virgin pa si Lola Imee Marcos, bumenta na.

Lahat ng presidente ginawa yan. Minsan meron pang intelligence leaks of a terror plot , or ang mabenta noon , ang coup plots. Pati nga si Marcos nag-stage ng fake ambush, di ba ? Noon pa, social reformers have been tarred as terrorists. Ngayon ba kung di ka payag sa dagdag tax, addict ka na ? Andanar is just the latest in a long line of Palace loudspeakers who has peddled the coup line.

And when the next scandal breaks out, the next diversionary lie will be used, and the more serious the allegation, the more outrageous the defense, the more incredible the alternative facts.

Ang bago lang ngayon, post-fact ang accusations. Never mind if the charges won‚Äôt stick, for as long as the mud does. Optics rule. In the case of De Lima, it's her police mug shot that is important and not the fine print of the charge sheet against her.

Every administration must have its own bogey : Marcos had the Reds. Cory had the coupals. GMA had Erap . PNoy used GMA as punching bag for 6 years. And Duterte has the Yellows and the Kano as the contrabida.

Even if Digong had ran under LP, he would have to invent an adversary as a matter of necessity. Kasi kung walang contrabida, walang bida. Kapag nakita ka ng taumbayan na wala kang sinusuntok, sa susunod ikaw na ang susuntukin nila.

At isa pa, the designated ‚Äúbad hombre‚Äù serves as an important prop. Even if you don‚Äôt smell like roses, in fact even if you stink to high heavens , having a person who stinks badly than you would serve as your deodorant .

At swerte si Digong, at hulog ng langit ang dismal record ng LP sa ilang areas ng governance . It provides him with a deep arsenal of counter charges he can lob back when something is thrown against him. Multiple choice ang bala na pwede nyang pang-resbak : Mamasapano, DAP, MRT, LRT, car plates, etcetera. Uupak si PNoy ? Three syllables lang ang sagot ni Digong : A-ba-ya. So it can be inferred that it was PNoy who gave Digong his inoculation shots.

If Digong will do a PNoy, then he will only be following on the footsteps of the original Boy Sisi . A gentle reminder to Digong : Don‚Äôt fall into the trap that consumed PNoy, who practiced rearview mirror politics instead of focusing on the road ahead.

Early on PNoy found the simple formula of bagging high ratings : Upakan si Gloria, and the SWS needle would move up. Kahit hindi maayos ang MRT, OK lang 80 percent naman ang approval. Eh weno kung walang plaka? 80 percent naman ang approval rating.

At the end of the day , the bubble burst , which contained inflated accomplishments plus plenty of hot air.

Digong may have been lulled into believing that statecraft is not needed to hit stratospheric ratings , using stagecraft ( mura cum droga) would do . Basta malibang ang tao sa paulit-ulit, stream of consciousness , folksy talk, OK na .

Kahit walang murang pagkain, basta nakakatikim naman ng mura from Tay Digong, hindi na iniinda ang kulo ng sikmura.

And true enough people are lapping up the political vaudeville shows being staged. Kulong si De Lima and that is misconstrued as a government in action.

With De Lima as the local star of the Philippine edition of the ‚ÄúOrange is the New Black‚Äù the real problems are forgotten. De Lima is the new Fentanyl.

E ano kung hindi maka-create ng 1.5 million jobs a year? E ano kung hindi ma-liberate ang 2 million poor from poverty yearly ? E ano kung wala pang na-ro-rollout na big projects ? Ang importante happy ang tao na may binubugbog si Digong. Never mind if people below are stuck in the same old rut .

Jobs, poverty, infra are not sexy issues that would grab headlines and seduce blah-gers to churn out puff pieces. But these are the numbers that truly matter, not the tally of body bags

Fast forward to 2022 . This vicious cycle gets replayed as it had been over the past 30 years. For as long as the people in power will have more vendetta in mind than vision, the spectacle we are seeing now will get staged again . Today's sages will be tomorrow's scapegoats. But it will be worse because by then civil discourse had evaporated and the practice of tapping divergent views to enrich programs and improve ideas will no longer be valued .Feedback flows through the healthy arteries of civic discussion . When those are clogged by intolerance, democracy flatlines.

Meanwhile, China is building the last mile of the Macau-HK bridge. Tayo 200-meter footbridge lang across NAIA 3 , national triumph na ang peg.

Kaya ang laban hindi Digong vs De Lima, DDS vs LP, or this administration vs the past. That is insular in-fighting. Parang backwater barangay league trophy ang pinagaawayan when our sights should be higher. In this globalized ecosystem, the race is us against the world. Baka sa susunod, tagalinis na tayo ng kubeta ng mga Vietcong because we focused all our energies on whom to destroy and not on what to build.
Pucha naman nung 3 SONAs ago yata ang ibinida na science achievement ng Pilipinas ay empty Nido milk can na ginawang dengue mosquito trap - at a time when a 

Malaysian was already orbiting in space.

Lapit na bahay. Pause muna. Puchang traffic ito.
