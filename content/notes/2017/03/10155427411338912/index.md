So, rewatching the first Bay Transformers. Sam literally has no words to describe the transformers he first encounters. He lives in a world that has no sci-fi concept of cars transforming into robots, and by extension, anything else transforming into robots. That means their universe has no Transformers, Gobots, Voltron, Robotech, Voltes V, probably Gundam, and so on. What kind of cartoons did they have as a kid?
