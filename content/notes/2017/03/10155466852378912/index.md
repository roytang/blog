"There's killings, but don't worry, it's only for the poor." 

"There's killings, but don't worry, most of them were probably criminals anyway." 

"The police might kidnap, extort, or even murder you, but don't worry, the president has their back."  

Yung exagerrated reports on drug usage di na kailangan itone down, baka maka attract pa nga yun ng tourists.
