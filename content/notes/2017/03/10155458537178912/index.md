1. The president announces to the world that we have a drug problem using exaggerated data [1] and urges people to kill drug addicts [2], vows mass murder and likens himself to Hitler [3], and supports policemen who kill, even when independent bodies find them complicit [4]. International bodies condemn the drug war [5][6], commentators from other countries openly mock the president for his words [7][8]. Rhetoric and death penalty approval threatens international trade deals [9][10]. Also secretly makes deals with foreign powers without the knowledge of the DFA. [11]
   
2. VP complains to the UN about the drug killings, using (allegedly) exaggerated data, allegedly causing economic sabotage and embarassment to the country
   
If #2 is treasonous and cause for impeachment, certainly #1 should be as well. The difference is that one of these statements is made by a person who holds no political power and no control over the police and army and senate and congress and whose only alleged "crime" is complaining about other crimes. (compare to: being accused of actually perpetrating said crimes). What are the powers-to-be so afraid of?

(Welp, I ended up ranting again, more than expected. Lent isn't even over yet. I just couldn't stand the hypocrisy anymore.)
