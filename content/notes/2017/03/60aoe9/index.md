#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Japan multiple entry visa on old/expired passport](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/60aoe9/japan_multiple_entry_visa_on_oldexpired_passport/)

Hi baka lang may makasagot dito. I got a multiple entry visa to Japan nung 2015 valid until 2018. But I had my passport renewed last year (2016), so the visa on my old passport. I'm travelling to Japan again in April. I'm told that i just need to bring both passports when i travel, but i couldnt find any official confirmation of this. May nakatry na ba nyan dito?
