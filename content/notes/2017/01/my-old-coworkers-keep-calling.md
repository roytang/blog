Tell them. “Hey you know, I really enjoy our chats, but to be honest I don’t really want to talk about the old job anymore. That part of my life is done, you know? I don’t want to think about it anymore and move on professionally. So I’d appreciate if we keep work out of our chats, I’m sure you’ll understand, right?”
