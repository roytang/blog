  "text": "If that&#x27;s the case, it&#x27;s not so different than playing a 1v1 and expecting your opponent to be -5% to +5% better than you, and winning / losing accordingly.    You will probably not even feel na mabigat ka in those team scenarios where you are 5% less efficient.    The only scenarios I can conjure na medyo pabigat ka and your team wins the game is if the enemy goes all in and attacks your base, leaving their bases wide open to reprisal from your friends. In which case, you were the distracting bait and while you feel bad on getting 4v1&#x27;d, you did your job.",
