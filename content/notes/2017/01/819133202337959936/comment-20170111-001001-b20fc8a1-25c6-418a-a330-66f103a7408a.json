Fighting games also typically implement some sort of comeback mechanism that allow a player in a losing situation to turn things around. I highly recommend reading  http://www.sirlin.net/articles/slippery-slope-and-perpetual-comeback  and the rest of Sirlin&#x27;s articles on playing competitively (he&#x27;s a former competitive SF player who is now a board game designer - he created Puzzle Strike and that Panda poker game we used to play)",
