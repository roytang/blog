  "text": "Re: DOTA Game, I&#x27;m not an expert, but turnarounds happen a lot. The game has a lot of math involved, but generally speaking, if a losing team plays defensively, they only need to succeed once to semi-balance the odds.    The game has a built-in snowball and counter-snowbal l effect. Teams that win clashes tend to carry more gold post fight, but heroes with killstreaks also get juicier, with their gold bounty increasing when they do get killed in the next clash.    The game also has several different metas depending on team compositions that are being run. Some team comps have phases where they just suck, but once the game matures and everyone has some measure of gold and levels, their golden age kicks in (like when key players get key items or have ultimate skills go online as a natural course of levelling) where the tables can turn.    Sometimes, yes, the enemy team can screw up, misfiring a spell or being caught out of place, or some teammate can miraculously initiate perfectly.    I&#x27;m sure our mutual DOTA player friends have more to say on this subject.",
