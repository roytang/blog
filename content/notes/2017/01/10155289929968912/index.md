Apparently in this environment not even the cops are able to distinguish a legitimate police operation from flat out murder. One would assume the strangling of a defenseless hooded victim would be a dead giveaway, but maybe for some reason, they believe that such things are normal? Could there be some higher up giving overt hints that this is the kind of thing he wants cops doing?
