#SGRPCommentary: "MOCHANG BAYAD NI BONGBONG?"

(To FB PH Moderators: This post complies with Community Standards - we've checked - and 1.) does not prescribe nor facilitate the sale of drugs, firearms, or pornography; 2.) does not engage in hate speech nor targeted harassment of private individuals, and; 3.) does not engage in violations of a sexual nature.

If you abuse your power to censor this post in line with pro-Duterte/Marcos political views - just as you have with many other critics of the administration, while allowing pro-Duterte posts depicting Leni Robredo and Leila De Lima in a sexually obscene manner, and/or giving them death threats to stay - then we will be documenting your actions for reports to Facebook International, and push for an audit and review of your positions.)

On the night of January 4, 2017, pages Madam Claudia and Assortedge released photos showing a P300,000 cheque addressed to Mocha Uson from a blacked-out name, with a signature identical to that of Bongbong Marcos'.

Immediately, the Duterte-Marcos Troll Army proceeded to flood-report Madam Claudia's post into oblivion, scrambling to censor all posts containing the cheque image from social media.

As of 1:45 AM, January 5, 2017, here are the casualties:

- Private individuals who have reposted the image report harassment from Duterte-Marcos trolls.

- "Mr. Obosen" has been taken down, resulting in a new page: Mr. Obosen Obosen.

- Assortedge has deactivated.

- Madam Claudia has deactivated.

In light of these events, it's time for a few important observations:

1.) Strangely, THE IMAGE AND POST DO NOT VIOLATE FACEBOOK COMMUNITY STANDARDS, and yet the Duterte-Marcos Troll Army is scrambling for damage control, aided by Duterte-Marcos loyalists who work for the local companies that Facebook outsources its moderation to.

If image, or the idea itself depicts a complete lie, what is the need for such a hurried, scared, defensive reaction? It's almost like a corrupt politician who was caught stealing people's money and denying it repeatedly before the cameras. Why so defensive? They haven't scrambled for damage control his hard since the mass protests after the stolen LNMB Burial.

Even if the image itself COULD be false, the reaction of Mocha and her allies itself gives credibility to the idea that she is funded by the Marcoses.

2.) Mocha constantly implies (if not says outright) that critics of the administration are merely "yellows" or funded by the Liberal Party, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Is she overcompensating for some insecurity? (Such as, say, being paid by the Marcoses herself?)

One of Mocha's posts, made in 2011, an image of PNoy, talked about how "good" he looks "in his leather jacket" and how she hoped to entertain him with one of her dance shows. Unless you have fickle (balimbing) principles, such a quick turnaround seems extremely suspicious, and reeks of money.

X.) It's both amazing and outrageous how Mocha has the gall to talk about the post and image being "libelous," when she constantly spreads misinformation about Leni and other critics of Digong, making up all sorts of rumors and calling them all kinds of names. 

Mocha posts fake propaganda (which look like shitty MS Paint edits) and expects everyone to believe it right away. But when the discussion is turned against her, she demands proof, fact-checks, and even cries "libel."

It's not so fun when the shoe's on the other foot, is it now? Sino na ba ang IPOKRITA ngayon?

4.) Mocha Uson's posts ceaselessly attack and discredit Leni Robredo, all but painting her as a Fake VP, and explicitly calling her "pabigat sa bayan." On the other hand, she is very careful not to mention Bongbong Marcos generally.

She had even gone so far as to prioritize attacking Leni over promoting the MMFF as its "Ambassadress" (something WE PAY FOR WITH OUR TAXES, through the MMDA), with only 37 out of 234 posts (19.79%, or 2 out of 10) between Dec. 23 and Dec. 31 relevant to the MMFF.

Such virulent attacks are exactly what Bongbong Marcos and his family would want; to use agents (such as Duterte and Mocha) who appear to be separate forces, but in reality, advance their own agenda. This became clear when Duterte revealed that Imee Marcos funded his campaign, followed by his giving of favors to the Marcoses, such as the stolen LNMB Burial.

TO MAKE THE LONG STORY SHORT:

* That bank check image may seem suspicious. But the way Mocha and allies reacted was far more suspicious.

* They are scared. They are hiding something. And they do not want all of us to know what it is.

But come on. The Filipino people can't be THAT stupid so as to not put any of the pieces together. We're not Mocha Uson.
