  "text": "In fairness to Duterte, this doesn't apply to him:  At the same time, the President is not off the hook; he, too, is to blame. His first mistake is that he failed to communicate clearly to his allies in Congress what his position is on the bill. He should have told them that he would veto the bill if and when it reaches his desk.      His position has always been clear on this issue, up until he changed his mind.",
