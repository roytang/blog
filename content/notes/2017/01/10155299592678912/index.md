Alternative facts! Kaya ba umattend ng inauguration si Andanar, to take lessons? Or siya ang nagturo sa team ni Trump? Lol

We know the Trump team loves the term "fake news," now will their new term be "alternative facts?"

This morning on [Meet the Press](https://www.facebook.com/MeetThePress/), Trump advisor KellyAnne Conway defended press secretary Sean Spicer's "news" conference about the inauguration's crowd size. Despite Spicer having made numerous points that could easily be disproven by photos and video of the event, Conway said Spicer had it right. She said he presented 'alternative facts.' Chuck Todd rightfully challenged her and pointed out that alternative facts are not facts, they're falsehoods.

But even more alarming was in the same interview, Conway said, if this type of coverage of the Trump White House continues, they are going "to have to rethink our relationship with the press."  It is becoming clear that President Trump's ongoing war with the media (his words, not ours) is not coming to an end anytime soon. There are some who believe undermining the public's trust in the media is a finely-honed strategy of the new Administration. 

And clearly, many who voted for Trump already have trust issues with the press. 

Regardless, less than 48 hours into his presidency, President Trump's relationship with the press remains as adversarial as ever.
