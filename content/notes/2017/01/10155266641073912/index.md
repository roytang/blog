Happy rainy/snowy day! 

As you may know, a while ago I tried to synthesize all 200+ cognitive biases down into an easier to understand framework, which I posted as a "cognitive bias cheat sheet" on Medium. It was still pretty long and confusing (I didn't expect people to actually read it) but it took off in some surprising circles and 4 months later it's been viewed 700,000 times! And now that I've been mulling this over, I figured I should actually do an honest cheat sheet version. 

Here's my attempt to reduce all the complexity and random unneeded details from 200+ biases into something that can fit on your phone's lock screen:

As befits a project like this, I also created a Facebook page for my book, which I am now going to ask you to go over and "like". Wait for it... 

So, yeah, if you are at all interested in this topic, would you like my page? I'll be your best friend. You are the best. friend. ever.

Thank you!
