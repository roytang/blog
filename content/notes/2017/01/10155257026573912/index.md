  Dry run for the Big Shit?
 </p>
 <p>
  There is no ouster plot except in the imagination of Duterte fanatics.  As Inday Espina-Varona puts it, it's silly to claim Leni Robredo's begging for support from different sectors to hang on to the vice presidency constitutes a plot against the president.  But the fact that the plot is fiction is irrelevant because Malacanang needs a conspiracy.  This is the reality that drives fiction.  Alleging an ouster plot led by the vice president has important political functions: 1) It paves the way for a fascist-type mobilization of the president's base, perhaps even leading to a preemptive "counter EDSA." 2) It keeps the opposition off balance and fragmented.  3) It keeps the president's allies in the elite in line, the message being "I'm watching you."  4) It keeps the minds of citizens away from the extra-judicial killings and the regime's inability to deliver on its promised social reforms and battle against corruption.  Keep the pot boiling at white heat--that's the technique Malacanang is trying to master and the current moves are probably only a dry run--meant to iron out the kinks in the process--for the Big Push, when Big Daddy decides it's time for the Big Shit.
