Sometimes simply putting in time and effort may not be enough. You have to make sure your time and effort are being spent wisely. This can only be done by thinking and analysing your own learning process. Think about how you are studying algorithms and try to figure out why you are having difficulty remembering or learning. Try to identify specific problems you have instead of a general “I am really weak”.

Algorithms are primarily a function of problem solving skill and the ability to break down a problem into a series of logical steps. When studying algorithms, make sure you’re not just doing rote memorization of the steps involved - instead try to get a basic understanding of why those steps work. Compare the algorithm to how you would solve the problem manually, using only your human brain. Think about it from different angles.

Since you said you have already put much time I assume that you have already implemented those algorithms you are studying, as in you wrote the code yourself and you understand what each line does and you can step through the code as it executes and see where the program flows. If not, that’s something you should definitely be doing.
