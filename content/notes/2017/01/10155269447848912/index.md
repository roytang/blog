Well, the problem with this argument is as we have seen in recent months, many of those who profess fanatical support for a leader have no qualms about doing harm to dissenters, so maybe they would even approve of BBM wanting to airstrike the protesters.

Jose Vener Ibarra  updated his status. Leni leaks kayo ng Leni leaks wala namang katotohanan. Pero eto may katotohanan: Si Bongbong binalak kaming patayin sa isang airstrike nuong Feb.25, 1986. I was on EDSA on that date.  Lies? It is a documented historical fact (even seen on live TV) that Bongbong Marcos argued with his father in public and wanted to sacrifice the lives of those on EDSA just to hold on to power.   That is the person you want to return to power.  The next time we do People Power, let's settle the score.
