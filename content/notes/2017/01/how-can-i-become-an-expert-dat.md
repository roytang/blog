<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The same way you can become an expert in anything else - time and effort. Take on more database-focused work. Take more challenging tasks. Study your mistakes. Read relevant books. Study. Practice. Learn. Grow.</p></span>
