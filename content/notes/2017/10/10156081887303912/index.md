I'm reminded once again of one my favorite movies.

"I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very freedom that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather that you just said "thank you" and went on your way."

- Colonel Nathan R Jessup, "A Few Good Men"
