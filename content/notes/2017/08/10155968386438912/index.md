"Life is short

and the world is at least half terrible

and for every kind stranger,

there is one who would break you,

though I keep this from my children.

I am trying to sell them the world.

Any decent realtor,

walking you through a real shithole,

chirps on about good bones:

This place could be beautiful, right?

You could make this place beautiful."

-- Good Bones by Maggie Smith
