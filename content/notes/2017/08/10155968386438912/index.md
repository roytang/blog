"Life is short
and the world is at least half terrible
and for every kind stranger,
there is one who would break you,
though I keep this from my children.
I am trying to sell them the world.
Any decent realtor,
walking you through a real shithole,
chirps on about good bones:
This place could be beautiful, right?
You could make this place beautiful."

-- Good Bones by Maggie Smith
