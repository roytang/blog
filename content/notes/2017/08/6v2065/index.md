#### Posted on r/VPN: [VPN Noob looking for recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/6v2065/vpn_noob_looking_for_recommendations/)

Hi,

I've been having some issues with my ISP, and made a post on superuser (https://superuser.com/questions/1242765/unable-to-access-google-services-sporadically/1242862#1242862). Someone suggested that a VPN might help with the issue. I'm not looking for specific features like accessing netflix from another country or something, I just need to test whether a VPN would fix my issue.

Any recommendations for something quick and easy and safe to install?
