I know Jvee personally so this kind of thing makes me more angry than the other stories going around. Seriously, the world our president creates =/ How soon before someone I know personally gets victimized?

  My Uber driver has been our family's driver (my brother's then my dad's) for more than a decade. He went back home to Cabanatuan in June to rest up. He was supposed to come back mid-July but then I lost touch with him. I didn't think anything of it. I just assumed he found a better gig back home.
 </p>
 <p>
  Today, he shows up, hair in a buzzcut. He and his wife just spent two weeks in jail. They live in a less than desirable neighborhood so that was good enough reason for the cops to show up at their place.
 </p>
 <p>
  The police took everything. Phones, cash, sari-sari store earnings, anything of value. Then they got placed in a cell that's big enough for 40 people. There were 150 of them in that cell. Almost everyday a fight would break out. He's now traumatized at the sight of playing cards.
 </p>
 <p>
  My sister was able to lend him money for the 12k bail (originally 48k). He's got a hearing set next week. He has to borrow money from neighbors everyday just to feed his family.
 </p>
 <p>
  He and I are the same age. I've known him since college. We practically grew old together. He drove for my brother, who's a priest but spent most of his driving career driving for my dad, who, if you knew him, is the nicest boss he ever got. He cried as much as I did when my dad died. Frankly, he's a better man than I am.
 </p>
 <p>
  I blame you, Mr. President. I blame you for normalizing police brutality. I blame you for protecting erring cops. I blame all the people who put you in power. I blame all the people who look away when innocent people are jailed or killed.
 </p>
 <p>
  He's a good man. He didn't deserve this. No one does. But this is our reality now.
