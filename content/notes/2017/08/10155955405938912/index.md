Trying to get a taxi at North Avenue, around 10pm.  I hailed 5 taxis, all of them had the "FOR HIRE" sign on. Only two of them actually stopped. The first one refused when I told him where I was going (a mere 5 km away). The actual ride took < 30 mins with minimal to no traffic.  This is the future #LTFRB wants.  (Madali pa yun kasi nagpalipas ako ng rush hour sa mall and I knew better than to try to get a taxi inside the malls like a noob)
