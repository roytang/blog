Just got off the phone with Grab. Brought up the whole issue of drivers refusing rides or jacking up prices. 

Here's what they did. They suspended 481 drivers who had an acceptance rate of less than 70%. They banned another bunch (he didn't have the exact number on hand) that fell below 30% acceptance rate. And every driver got a warning saying they will get stricter and stricter with acceptance rates and will start rewarding drivers who have a 95% acceptance rate and above. They also tweaked the algorithm to lower the trigger number of the surge and capped it at 1.4x. So if still you have issues, use the app to report. They are keeping an eye on it and hopefully we can weed out the unscrupulous ones from the platform. 

Just thought many of you would like to know that. I'll post more when I know more.
