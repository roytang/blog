"TO THE DOLTS who don't understand..."

From [Krip Yuson](https://www.facebook.com/krip.yuson):

To the dolts who don't understand the continued need to uphold human rights, those who are quick to claim that as monsters, drug lords deserve to be eliminated with impunity, try to read the following passage, if you are literate at all. (And just maybe you can arrive at an understanding of reason and rationality.)

"William Roper: So, now you give the Devil the benefit of law!

"Sir Thomas More: Yes! What would you do? Cut a great road through the law to get after the Devil?

"William Roper: Yes, I'd cut down every law in England to do that!

"Sir Thomas More: Oh? And when the last law was down, and the Devil turned 'round on you, where would you hide, Roper, the laws all being flat? This country is planted thick with laws, from coast to coast, Man's laws, not God's! And if you cut them down, and you're just the man to do it, do you really think you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then? Yes, I'd give the Devil benefit of law, for my own safety's sake!"

â€”A Man For All Seasons
