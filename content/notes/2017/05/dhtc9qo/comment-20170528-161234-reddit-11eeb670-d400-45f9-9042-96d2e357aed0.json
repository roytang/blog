  "text": "All good answers in other comments, but this is the best so far. Do you have any *complicated* knowledge regarding: \"For any stock, there is a current market value, which is (simplified) the price of the stock for the last transaction it was sold.\"\n\nIf I were to sell 1 of my stocks (worth $100) for $1 then clearly the market price would not go from 100 to 1. Is there an actual equation? Is the price changed by a certain X factor or weight applied to the number of stocks sold at that price? (That last sentence might not make sense, but that's the direction my curiosity is obsessed with trying to solve.\n\nAlso, where is all this decision making/calculations happening? Clearly on a computer/server by some advanced program super computer thing... but who runs/owns it? Does the NYSE own/manage it? Does that even make sense....what is the NYSE exactly?\n\nFYI: all of this curiosity stems from a childhood memory of my father trying to explain to me what happened to peoples money and millions of dollars when they invested in a scam company (the owner laundered/stole the money). I didn't get a definitive answer...I was a child at the time so I guess that is normal, but now I am an adult, and although I know thereis not a definitive answer for EVERYTHING in the universe, I fervently believe that since the stock market/economy was created by humans from nothing, then there is a definitive answer.\n",
