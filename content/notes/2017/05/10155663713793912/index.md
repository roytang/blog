"It's different this time, there are constitutional checks and balances..." <- doesn't help if the president chooses to blatantly ignore the constitution, eh?

For the record, I'm not against ML in Marawi. I agree with decisive action against terrorists, and while the AFP claimed it had things under control, the fact that there's fighting even until now  shows that they clearly did not. ML in entire Mindanao, eh, I wouldn't have suggested it, but I can see an argument for it. Anywhere else, disagree. (But apparently my opinion doesn't count because I'm from Luzon... or something)

Only semi-related: someone on my feed earlier (I forget who) commented that the usual media outlets always try to make the president look bad and the LP look good. To be honest, that's got to be one of the easiest jobs in the world. I mean, the president doesn't really need any help there. He comes up with a nearly consistent 2-3 WTFs per day, minimum.* Many of our corrupt politicians might look better if they stood beside him; I've seen people who were so vehemently anti-Binay during the past elections comment that sana si Binay na lang nanalo.
