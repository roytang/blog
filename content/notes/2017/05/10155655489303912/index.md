I held off on commenting about this for a while because seriously? We already knew the president has no shame, but here he is publicly admitting that he's firing someone simply for disagreeing with his 5-year old hearsay data where we don't even know how that data was collected.  Think about what this means for anyone working in government who gathers data - if your data goes against the president's whims, better not release it or you risk losing your job. Truth is a secondary matter as compared to the president's caprice. Now, whenever someone from the government posts "data" you have to ask yourself - is this data legitimate, or is someone afraid of getting fired?  

Semi-related anecdote: Back in HS physics class, I had this groupmate (who shall remain nameless) who would come to class already having precomputed the expected outcome for our experiments and he would berate us (jokingly of course) if the measured results didn't match his computation.   

That's what this feels like, only instead of rock-solid already proven scientific principles we're discussing statistics that are difficult to measure and would easily vary over time and the guy prefers something he heard someone say five years ago over actual survey data taken recently. All because it fits his goddamn agenda and he tries to use it to justify his brutal drug war.  

Seriously. And people wonder why I don't trust this president?
