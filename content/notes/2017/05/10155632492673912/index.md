I'm glad I don't have to worry about this new Anti Distracted Driving brouhaha. But from what I can see, it seems the biggest problem with this law is that it is subject to misinterpretation and people need to keep confirming with the LTO or other such experts what the law does and does not allow. I expect that this gives traffic enforcers a lot of leeway (read: chances for extortion)
