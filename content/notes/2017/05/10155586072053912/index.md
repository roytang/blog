  AFP Statement on the "Open Letter to AFP Chief Gen Eduardo Año":

  Colonel Edgard A Arevalo PN(M)(GSC),
  <br/>
  Public Affairs Office Chief

  The "open letter" has come to the attention of the AFP leadership.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's disappointing that such comments were made in social media on an alleged "fake news" concerning Miss Maria Ressa by the reported active and former members of the organization.
 </p>
 <p>
  The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) Chief General Eduardo Año was very upset by the reports that has spread in social media. It was not sanctioned and will never be tolerated by the AFP. Such behavior was not taught at the Philippine Military Academy.
 </p>
 <p>
  Much as the original post was made by someone who is no longer part of the military,  the ungentlemanly comments  posted by some who are still in the active service, though in their personal capacities, were nonetheless of poor taste and do not bespeak well of them as members of the military organization.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gen Año has ordered the Provost Marshall General of the AFP to conduct thorough investigation on the matter forthwith.
 </p>
 <p>
  We would like to assure the public and the netizens that your AFP is comprised of  professional officers and enlisted personnel whose main preoccupation is combating the enemies of the state that disrupts the peace in the communities and threatens the security of the country.
 </p>
 <p>
  The AFP is composed of Officers and men who have made and are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for the nation and for fellow Filipinos.
 </p>
 <p>
  But we will not allow any conduct unbecoming of officers and gentlemen by some individuals who do not represent the entire Armed Forces of the Philippines.
 </p>
 <p>
  We publicly apologize to Miss Maria Ressa for the emotional pain, anxiety, and humiliation those irresponsible comments and unkind remarks might have caused her.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is certainly not in keeping with the AFP as an institution that is committed to the protection and advocacy of human rights especially those of women.
