Designated Survivor: I like the parts where Tom Kirkman is dealing with day-to-day governance issues. It's not gritty politics like House of Cards, it's kind of the opposite - Kirkman is very much the kind of altruistic statesman the world could use right now. And occasionally he manages to beat the system too.   The conspiracy parts with Maggie Q were okay, except that the resolution turned out to be really lame. TBF, resolving conspiracy plots is difficult; the tendency is either (a) overly-complicated conspiracies with multiple layers that get drawn out until the series gets cancelled (see: X-Files); (b) overly-simple conspiracies with lame resolutions
