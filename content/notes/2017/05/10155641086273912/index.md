Well, the main problem with such an approach is that it requires a lot of money and effort and time, and we as a nation might be too short-sighted for this sort of thing to work. A lot of people here seem to think it's better to have a violent crackdown and have people shot in their homes for being casual drug users. Or something. I imagine this is the sort of thing EU countries would be happy to give aid for though.
