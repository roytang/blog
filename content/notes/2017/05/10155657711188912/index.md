This video is awesome, but I'll use it as an opportunity to talk about Arrow.

Everyone knows that although Amnell supposedly plays Green Arrow, he's really just a poorly disguised Batman. For most of the last season, I don't think his being an archer was relevant at all. He might as well have been throwing batarangs around. 

Also, IDK if Arrow is renewed, but I wouldn't mind it if this season's cliffhanger was the series finale lol. Five seasons is a good point to stop since at this point we run out of flashback years. Then we can proceed to a Deathstroke spin-off with Amnell occasionally guest-starring.
