JUSTICE LEAGUE Spoiler-Free Review:

- Movie was OKAY. Started out fine, build-up was good, kind of surprised with what happened in the middle, then a disappointing conclusion
- Movie was SHORT. IMDB says 120 minutes but my watch told me it was &lt; 2h. Probably could have spent more time putting the team together or setting up the characters or such
- the movie does pander a lot to comic/DC fans; Batman/Superman themes play in the background when they first appear; References to some other DC characters during the exposition, etc
- Ugh Steppenwolf so boring and terrible
- I think Ezra Miller and Gal Gadot were the best here out of the lead roles. 
- A number of fight scenes reminded me of Injustice
- the best part of this movie was the Black Panther trailer that I somehow hadn't seen or heard of yet
- for some reason the other comic book movie that came to mind was X-Men Apocalupse
- Gary Oldman should play JJJ in the next Spider-Man so that he and JK Simmons will have effectively role-swapped
- one mid credits scene for fun and one end credits scene as a portent of things that may come later
- Imax was okay. There was one scene where I instinctively moved my head to avoid an incoming projectile
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: It's very much a fantasy action movie so probably not. 
- we still get Batman with guns and Superman who threatens to kill
- no title drop and no Superfriends reference = LAME
