I like how this story epitomizes a number of problems with our country at the same time:

1. Traffic
2. The masses forced to suffer while the privileged are given special treatment
3. "Diskarte": The audacity to brag about breaking the rules because you know that in our society, people approve of those who find ways around the rules to get ahead. It's the same reason undisciplined drivers try to shortcut traffic rules when they think traffic enforcers aren't looking. Our society accepts such rule-breaking, so people are proud to be #pasaway. Para-paraan lang
4. People blindly following someone who's breaking the rules, without asking whether they should. "Sumunod lang ako e!"

#belikemaria indeed
