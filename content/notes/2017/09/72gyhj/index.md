#### Posted on r/Steam: [Is there any API or Service that lets me see my Steam play history?](https://reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/72gyhj/is_there_any_api_or_service_that_lets_me_see_my/)

Like, what games did I play on which dates, etc.

Logically since Steam logs my total hours played, it should be possible to track it on a daily basis based on the delta to the running total. IDK if there's a way to get the historical data though
