Sorry for an early week political post...but I just have to say that Duterte’s strategist is amazing after seeing this photo.

When news of Kian’s death came out, his strategists tried the following:

1. Claimed that policemen HAD to do it because Kian fired at them

2. When that did not work because there was a cctv footage, claimed that it wasn't Kian in the footage

3. When the noise did not go down because regardless of CCTV, Kian was still killed by policemen, tried to redirect the issue to Hontiveros being a political opportunist

4. Just to give further fuel to the solid supporters, they even showed a photo of VP Leni with the policeman who killed Kian (later on proven as fake news, but not before a lot of non-critical minds actually believed)

5. When witnesses came out, they said witnesses were brainwashed

6. When the noise was still there, the demonization of Kian went into full swing - he was a runner, he was a bully, he was a lot of evil things. They claimed the opposition was creating a 'St Kian’

7. Since it did not work still, play the final trump card, separate the President from the problem. i.e. Hugas Kamay. The best way to do this is to get a photo with the parents of Kian doing the fist bump sign. The photo says, “This is not the president's fault - he is actually someone who will help bring justice.” Never mind the fact that he triggered, condoned, and normalized all these killings.

May photo op na. Uwian na. May nanalo na.

If you are a solid fan of the President, you will only require one of the 7 things above to be distracted from the real issue which is this: “People, some of them minors, are dying left and right without due process”. 

And that is why Duterte's strategist is so good. The issue has been so muddled that we forget what the issue really is.

If you really want what’s good for our country, please understand something: Being a good Filipino is not about having BLIND LOYALTY to a President. Being a good Filipino is about supporting the President in his good works and criticizing him in his bad actions.

Kaya tayo naabuso ng mga Marcos. Kaya tayo hindi naiahon ng mga Aquino. Kaya tayo nalusutan ng mga Arroyo - because of blind loyalty. Ganon na naman ngayon.

Wag na po tayong Pro-Duterte. Wag na rin po tayong maging Anti-Duterte. At lalong wag po tayong walang paki-alam. Pwede naman tayong maging nag-i-isip na Pilipino. Pag may magandang nagawa ang gobyerno, puriin. Pag may pangit na nagawa, batikusin.

Wag nating hayaang mahati tayo sa Pro vs Anti - dahil ito ang gusto nila, “Divide and conquer”.

Tayo ang kawawa pag hati-hati tayo at galit-galit tayo sa isa’t-isa.

Wag kalimutan ang totoong issue: "Maraming pinapatay na walang due process." Ibig sabihin, walang ligtas sa atin - may kasalanan ka man, o wala.
