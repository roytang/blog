The actions by Congress and idiotic statements from the SAGIP party list and Sotto etc tell us what to expect if the current administration and their lackeys were to rewrite our constitution. Their vision for the country: no checks and balances, no accountability, no complaining about the leadership.   And some people I used to know have the gall to claim that we should trust the leadership to fix the broken system when every thrust they have made so far takes us backwards. Magkakaron daw ng meritocratic system afterwards, e mukha bang meritocracy ngayon!  We've had idiotic politicians for as long as I can remember, but as far as I can tell the current crop takes the cake.  That's my political rant for the day. Now to go out and try not to get killed by cops.
