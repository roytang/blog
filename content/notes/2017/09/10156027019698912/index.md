119 "Representatives of the People" voted to cripple the institution protecting the rights of the people. 

UP ALYANSA strongly condemns these 119 Congressmen who voted to give a negligible amount of P1,000.00 to the Commission on Human Rights.

Human rights serve as a mantle of protection for the common man against the whims of the State whose power is effectively without limit. Now, more than ever, do we see the State tempting to find these limits.

Terror befalls the land where the mighty rule without chains. For to take on chance that mercy frustrates cruelty is to relent our immanent dignity.

The State will have its reasons to remove human rights in the picture. But the same cannot be said of us. We must be without reason not to preserve human rights.

Our very lives, our humanity. Human rights is the last straw. Let us hope that when the 2018 budget becomes finalized, these "honorable" representatives remedy such an error.
