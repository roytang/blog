        "text": "Note: The WD40 (lubricant) fix works if the reason you're double clicking isn't so much as the spring getting depressed/ worn, but rather the switch (TINY button/spur which depresses said spring) snagging on the mechanism casing (again making for slower springbacks which the PC interprests as a second click). If the lubricant works you won't have to fiddle with the spring.",
