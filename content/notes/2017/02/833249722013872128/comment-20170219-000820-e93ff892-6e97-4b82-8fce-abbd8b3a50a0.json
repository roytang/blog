  "text": "If it&#x27;s a higher end mouse (worth thousands), and double clicking is the only problem then retensioning the spring (it&#x27;s not really a corscrew type spring) might be worth it. I only ever did that with one mouse in the last 20 years (a Razr). Each time the repair lasted about 4-6 months. I only changed the mouse when it started double clicking again just 1 month after the last repair.",
