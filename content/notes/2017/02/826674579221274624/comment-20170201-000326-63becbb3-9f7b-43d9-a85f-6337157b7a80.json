It&#x27;s easy, and yes people are impatient. &quot;Criminals don&#x27;t deserve rights&quot; It&#x27;s not like I haven&#x27;t entertained such ideas myself. I think I&#x27;d be a bit more amenable to the idea if authorities were a lot more trustworthy - i.e. if cops could be completely trusted to make the determination on their own. Sadly, the authorities on this side of the world aren&#x27;t very trustworthy.",
