  Basic things to understand about freedom of expression and the role of the free press.
 </p>
 <p>
  1. I don't guarantee YOUR freedom of expression. It's the government that does that. As a private individual (or a company) I can censor, delete, ban, adjust, ignore, fold, spindle, mutilate, make fun of (until you cry) your remarks as much as I want.  That's how the Constitution works.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. The free press is not the "friend" or "partner" of the government. As the late Peter Pruefert, the director of the International Institute for Journalism in Berlin, once told me emphatically, the press is the ENEMY of government. This is how it works in a democracy. When the public (we the people) vote other people into office, we entrust them with vast powers and large sums of OUR money. How do we hold them to account, make sure they're not abusing things? Who will the public turn to for info on what the government is doing? The government? Martin Andollar? Pls don't make me laugh. That's where the free press comes in. It exposes (or is supposed to expose) the activities of government. It's not supposed to warble liltingly about the wonderful things government is doing - government has agencies for doing that, like the Office of the Pre$$ $ecretary. In a democracy, the government and the free press are antagonists. If they weren't -  it wouldn't be a democracy anymore.
