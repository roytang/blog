Arrival spoiler-free review:

- first half a bit boring
- Forrest Whitaker is hard to understand
- not sure if it was just the cinema I was at, but the audio and the lighting seemed quite bad at some points
- that being said, the movie was ok. I think it's comparable to, but not as good as, Interstellar
- if you watch it with people who don't pay attention, you'll have to explain stuff
