Final Fantasy 1 was programmed **in entirety** by an Iranian coder -- the absolute legend, Nasir Gebelli. He used no source and programmed directly into a mini-assembler. Nasir also coded Final Fantasy 2 and 3. His parents brought him to the US at a young age. His early games from Sirius Software inspired many people in the industry for whom the phrase "PROGRAMMED BY NASIR" is tattoo-worthy. While working on Final Fantasy 2 in Japan, his visa ran out, so Square relocated the team to Sacramento (where he still resides) so he could finish the game. I have thanked Nasir many times for his contributions to the industry and the growing game dev community, then largely on the West Coast of the US. This time, I would specifically like to thank the immigration officials who made his green card and later citizenship possible. We owe a ton of credit to Nasir (if you liked, Doom, for instance...)
