  "text": "Hey, 1 second of super strength isn't that bad. If you can invoke it repeatedly, and at will, it has no drawbacks. The loophole is that the strength is not capped, and the image shown demonstrates roughly 5-10x the strength of a normal person.    A hero with a martial artist background would be able to leverage this in melee combat.    Your throwing capabilities would be insane (you'd just have to work on your aim). You'd be lethal with a toothpick, or even some playing cards.     You can open doors with ease, provided the impact time is <= 1 second.",
