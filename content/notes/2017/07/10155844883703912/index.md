I wonder if medical science will be able to keep our generation alive long enough to see humans dying out due to climate change. 

I'm not confident at all that human society will be able to reverse this course through carbon emissions reduction (we humans are pretty bad at sacrificing today for future generations). I am however slightly more hopeful that maybe science will find a way to solve this problem for us.
