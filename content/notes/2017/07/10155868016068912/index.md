I find it so strange that there is actually criticism about the thirteenth Doctor being a woman. I've always assumed sci-fi fans would tend to be liberal in their thinking and Doctor Who in particular always felt to me that it had a liberal tendency. Once again, humanity has disappointed me lol. (Also I should really catch up with episodes before the internet spoils me on what happens with Twelve/Bill/Master/Missy/etc)
