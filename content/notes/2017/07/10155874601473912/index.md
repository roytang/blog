  There is no law that gives the LTFRB any authority to regulate or penalize Über or Grab. Über and Grab are not public utility companies. The drivers working for them are also not public utility transports. Their relationship to the riding public is not defined in ANY law in the Philippines. I can say that because I have checked not just in our law, but also in a number of landmark cases decided by the Supreme Court.
 </p>
 <p>
  A public utility is one offered to the general public for its use. Über and Grab are not for the general public's use. Unlike taxis, jeeps, and buses, you cannot just wait at the roadside and stop one of their cars.
 </p>
 <p>
  You need access to the Über or Grab app first. And even then, you have to wait for a driver who accepted your offer to ride-share. In other words, it works like a club membership. Only those who are members of the app in good standing can use the app and access its benefits - a decent ride. That isn't public use at all. That is private use.
 </p>
 <p>
  And if you check landmark SC cases on "public use vs. private use" in transportation law jurisprudence, you'll see this written in better legalese (I'm writing for those who hate legal-speak). Since this is private use, then it cannot be regulated by a law that covers public use.
 </p>
 <p>
  Another important point is that Über and Grab do not own any cars. They are in essence just a bulletin board system that announces available drivers and passengers, and connects one to the other. That's it. Again, this activity is not covered in any legal definition for public utilities. I don't think that our public utility laws consider bulletin boards with posts that say, "WANTED: VAN FOR HIRE" as a public utility.
 </p>
 <p>
  How about the owners of the cars? Are the cars covered by the law? No, of course not.
 </p>
 <p>
  These cars do not just pick up anybody from the street. They can only pick up those who invite them to a contract using the app. They will not be paid otherwise. Again, that shows that this is a private transaction. Only those with smartphones can use this service. It is not for the general riding public. Since these cars are not for the public at large, then they are not public utility vehicles, and cannot be regulated by the LTFRB.

   Just because Über and Grab decided to voluntarily submit themselves to LTFRB regulation does not change the fact that this regulation is unconstitutiona
