On this day in 1966, The Beatles performed two shows in Manila to 80,000 fans. Earlier that morning, they were supposed to be at Malacañang Palace at 11am but failed to show up. President Ferdinand Marcos and First Lady Imelda Marcos, and 300 children were waiting for The Beatles at the palace party. Philippine media later reported that The Beatles allegedly ‘snubbed’ the President and the First Lady. The Beatles’ manager, Brian Epstein was said to have declined the invitation as the palace had not made an official appointment with The Beatles in advance. He went on television to apologize, but the state-controlled channel blacked out as he started reading the press statement.

The following day at the airport, the band and their party were harassed and their security detail withdrawn. The crowd mocked them and Ringo Starr said in a press conference that the people started spitting at them. The band members publicly expressed resentment at their treatment, with John Lennon saying, “If we go back, it will be with an H-bomb. I won’t even fly over the place.” #TDIH
