I woke up and thought about watching the #XBoxE3 conf just to see how the other side lives...and 
it's already more than 30 mins old lol

That State of Decay 2 trailer reminded me a lot of Sony's Days Gone from the last E3 for some reason #XboxE3

Ooh DBZ FIghters!! #XboxE3

I enjoyed (and platinumed) Shadow of Mordor, but for some reason I'm not too stoked about the sequel #XboxE3

Nothing too exciting for me at the #xboxe3 conf, though the new dbz fighters game looks sweet. Sony tomorrow!
