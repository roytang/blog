Just saw two consecutive news segments on TV about cellphones being snatched from students. In the first segment, the police advised na "wag gumamit ng cellphone sa mataong lugar". In the second segment, the police advised students not to use their cellphones pag wala masyadong tao. Wut.  (Parang Singapore lang)
