1. I'm still totally mystified as to what exactly in the captioned image leads to the conclusion that "yellows are EVIL" and justifies killing. Is it the snappy, proper salute? Is it the celebration of our Independence? Help me understand! 
2. Yet another example of the sort of rhetoric inspired by the current leadership. Divisive and with an unhealthy obsession for killing. Good leadership should inspire us to be better people. Maybe someday we'll find some of that.
