While my stance on fake news should be obvious to anyone who sees the stuff I share on FB, I don't think criminalization is the proper approach. Ideally we should be educating people with proper facts and training them with critical thinking and proper evaluation of sources cited in order to counter fake news. Going down the route suggested by the senator leads to free speech issues down the line. Not to mention the secondary problem of whoever has to enforce this law having their natural biases, probably towards whoever is in power
