Software development, 2017: "Ooh, I'll try this [cool new thing]! It's easy, I'll just do a hello world app!" (Need to download and install an IDE, an SDK, a runtime, several plugins, restart your computer a few times, redownload the SDK after finding out you got the wrong version, setup build scripts and a virtual machine, checkout this sample code from github, and so on)
