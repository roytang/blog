Wonder Woman spoiler-free review:

- First act was best, second act was okay, third act/resolution a bit weak (and really kind of super obvious/predictable)
- The parallels with the first Captain American movie, especially in the 3rd act, are uncanny
- great battle/stunt choreography, especially in the first act
- Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright gave excellent performances
- Definitely better than Man of Steel/Dawn of Justice
- Not better than TDK/Logan. Come on people!
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly!
- Post-credits scenes: None
