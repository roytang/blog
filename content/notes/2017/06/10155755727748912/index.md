A visa officer nearly made me cry today.

She was pleasant throughout the interview, asking me about my previous trips abroad and quipping that NGOs must be busy these days. Fairly standard visa interview stuff - except for her parting words:

"Thank you for the work that you do."

I almost burst into tears right then and there. 

You see, I am a human rights worker. Thankless isn't just a metaphorical description of my job, it's a literal one. 

These days, my colleagues and I are more likely to hear "p*tangina mo", "sana ma-rape/bugbog/mamatay ka na lang", or "sabayin ko kayong [diyan sa human rights] putulan ng ulo", rather than "salamat". (That last threat of beheading, by the way, came straight from our President.)

I get it. When human rights defenders do our jobs right, the need for us is felt the least. The reason why there are people who feel privileged enough to exchange "rights" for "discipline" is because there were those who fought for those rights in the first place, knowing that success means being taken for granted. 

That's why a simple "thank you" can feel like a shock. But a welcome one.

Edited to add: Thanks for the, um, thanks, everyone! I didn't mean for this post to ellicit such reactions -- nagulat at na-touch lang talaga ako sa visa officer. But I'm grateful to know that the work of the human rights sector is not unappreciated. Please continue to spread the love, not just to me, but to any and all human rights advocates out there! ❤️❤️❤️
