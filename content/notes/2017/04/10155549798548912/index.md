One can speak "perfect English" and still have the moral perspective of a cockroach. Congratulations, Digong. Even if you were to step down or be deposed or drop dead today, you will leave behind as your legacy a generation of young Filipinos who believe in extrajudicial killing as the solution to all of life's irritations. Even Marcos could not have accomplished this.

Alan [Robles](https://www.facebook.com/alan.robles): "The fascist mass was slowly created and it only blossomed in its full fecal glory last year. Lots of things contributed to it. Rage, frustration, pathetic leaders, a toxic political framework, a poor education system, a misunderstanding of democracy, moral callousness, the onset of a thin consumerist culture."
