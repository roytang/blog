Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [If you are a software developer, are you willing to give up programming in rest of your life if you are given 100 million USD?](https://www.quora.com/If-you-are-a-software-developer-are-you-willing-to-give-up-programming-in-rest-of-your-life-if-you-are-given-100-million-USD/answer/Roy-Tang)


Sure, easily. I mean, I love programming, but there’s also other stuff I love and can do. Such an amount = freedom to pretty much do anything else I want. I will surely miss programming, but I’m sure I can find other worthwhile things to dig into. The programmer’s attitude of always being willing to learn new things means we never run short of problems we can try to solve, even without programming per se
