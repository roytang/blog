  "text": "I actually didn&#x27;t remember if BB8 was an astromech, but yeah sure. The list isn&#x27;t exhaustive. It does make you wonder, why do X-Wings need a droid to do their jump calculations? TIE fighters don&#x27;t, the Falcon didn&#x27;t. Star Destroyers aren&#x27;t shown to need droids for calculations.    Another thing: if they already have the AI communications technology, why are ships like X-Wings and the Falcon and TIE fighters and Star Destroyers piloted manually? Why not by voice command, with feedback in tones and beeps? Or if piloting is too complicated for a computer, why not at least have some simpler functionality like comms handled by droid-like AIs?
