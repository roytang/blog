TRAIN is neutral to okay for the middle class, who get to pay less taxes. Prices will go up, but since they have some discretionary funds to spend, they can simply manage their budget accordingly.

TRAIN is bad for the poor, who weren't paying taxes before anyway. They get no direct benefit, and yet have to suffer higher prices. They already have low discretionary funds to spend, so they have to stretch their budgets further.

TRAIN is a bit bad for the upper class (those who pay the correct taxes at least), but they have wider discretionary budget to spend so they will just pay a little more (or more will be driven to evade taxes completely)

TRAIN is good for the government, since it means more collections and less money spent on enforcement (since taxes on consumption are easier to collect/implement than personal income taxes)

Lastly, TRAIN is very bad for ROHQ employees due to the presidential veto.
