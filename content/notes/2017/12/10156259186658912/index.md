THE LAST JEDI Spoiler-free (promise) review:

- great movie, but there was this weird draggy part around the middle that they maybe could have done away with
- my brother whom I watched with says he thinks it was the best Star Wars movie ever. I'm not sure
- Adam Driver needs to either speak up or work around his accent a bit
- because we didn't plan this movie outing so well, we ended up with terrible seats (i.e. very first row, slightly off-center) in the Imax theater. I think the Imax was fine, but being so up close made for some weird angles sometimes and sometimes the 3d didn't work so well from where we were seated. And medyo nakakapagod sa mata. Never again!
- walang post-credit scene lol
