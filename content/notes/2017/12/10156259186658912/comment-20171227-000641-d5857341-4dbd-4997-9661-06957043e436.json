  "text": "The other movies sort of imply that the shields mostly stop blaster bolts, except in ROTJ, when a whole lot of ships have to turn because the shield around the Death Star is still operational, and in Rogue One, when fighters crash into the gate.    So if I had to make some scifi reasoning for how the bombers work, I&#x27;d say that they&#x27;re loaded with dumb explosives that have a casing that can just go through ray shielding, and the Dreadnaughts may have little armor and be fully dependent on shields.     Or it could be a small technological shift. Like, those dreadnaughts may take years to build, while the bombs are a new innovation that shield tech hasn&#x27;t caught up with yet (like how carriers and fighter bombers made battleships obsolete).    Ohh, if you meant them falling as if there&#x27;s gravity, yeah, JVee&#x27;s explanation would be it--they&#x27;re launched out by the bomber&#x27;s artificial gravity, then just keep going.",
