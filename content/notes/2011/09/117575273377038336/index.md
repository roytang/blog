Some good pulls at today's #MTGINN prerelease, though I only managed to go 3-1 http://yfrog.com/kf3cfmyrj

<time>[20:25]</time> I really wish I could find a local tournament venue that didn't offer hot, cramped playing areas and better chairs though :/

<time>[20:28]</time> The #MTGINN limited format seems fun, but it's kinda hard to not miss werewolf transforms on occassion.

<time>[2014-09-25 10:36]</time> These are all the rares I got in 9 packs at the #MTGINN http://yfrog.com/khbi9upgj Only 11 rares/mythics? Some people got 10 in six packs
