#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Does anyone know a good primer for how to play the Modern Pyromancer Ascension Deck?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/kjjc5/does_anyone_know_a_good_primer_for_how_to_play/)

I never actually played with/against PA in standard, so I'm not sure how it's supposed to go.
