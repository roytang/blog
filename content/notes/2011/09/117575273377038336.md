Some good pulls at today's #MTGINN prerelease, though I only managed to go 3-1 http://yfrog.com/kf3cfmyrj

[20:25] I really wish I could find a local tournament venue that didn't offer hot, cramped playing areas and better chairs though :/

[20:28] The #MTGINN limited format seems fun, but it's kinda hard to not miss werewolf transforms on occassion.

[Sep 25 10:36] These are all the rares I got in 9 packs at the #MTGINN http://yfrog.com/khbi9upgj Only 11 rares/mythics? Some people got 10 in six packs
