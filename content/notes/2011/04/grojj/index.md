#### Posted on r/gaming: [King's Bounty question](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/grojj/kings_bounty_question/)

I have 3 King's Bounty games that I apparently got back during the Steam holiday sales. Legend, Crossroads and Armored Princess. Just starting to play them now, surprisingly fun. What order should I play them in?
