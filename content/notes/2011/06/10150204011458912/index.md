> Roy, ok ba yung Duels of the Planeswalkers? Is it better than MTGO? Narinig ko kasi na not all cards in standard ay nasa Duels.  Can you tell me more on how you get cards, and the gameplay, etc.

It is *cheaper* than MTGO, not better ðŸ˜› Pero medyo masaya rin sya. Merong set of premade decks tapos when you win a match (either vs computer in the campaign or online), you unlock additional sideboard cards so pwede mo icustomize ung decks. At the start a small set of decks lang ang available, you unlock the others by playing sa campaign. Tapos ung cards nya hindi sya nagfofollow ng standard, in fact marami syang cards from throughout Magic's history.

Kung bibili ka, you should get the 2012 version which is coming out tomorrow (you can preorder it today and get free hats sa TF2 or something ðŸ˜›) Yung gameplay (at least sa 2011 version, not sure about 2012) is medyo simplified compared sa regular Magic, i.e. walang upkeep step or end of turn step, tapos may timer sya (default 20 seconds) within which you need to respond to spells/effects otherwise magpass na ng priority (this is to keep the game moving at a regular pace). Yung multiplayer is up to four players, and merong coop campaign for two players playing on the same machine (nde ko pa nasubukan, I think it's like 2HG)

If you like Magic, it's kind of a no-brainer to buy it, kasi $9.99 lang naman, and you get to play some decks with powerful cards, i.e. kung sa MTGO it will cost you some significant cash to do that.
