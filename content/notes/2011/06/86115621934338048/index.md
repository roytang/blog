I have to be honest, I didn't even know Oblivion Ring wasn't in Standard anymore. #BeenOutOfItForAWhile

<time>[00:56]</time> During the last GP I played in, I was about to play a textless Condemn when I had to stop and stare at it and wonder whether it was legal.

<time>[22:03]</time> This weekend's standard will be different from last weekend's. Then it will change again after two weekends. Three standards in four weeks!

<time>[22:15]</time> I think Chandra3 could have been 1RR without being OP. As it is she is quite fair.
