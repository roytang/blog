#### Posted on r/civ: [Civ5 - Stuck at "Please wait"](https://reddit.com/r/civ/comments/jwyax/civ5_stuck_at_please_wait/)

I havent played civ5 in a while and I thought I'd give the latest patch a go. I find that every so often the game hangs between turns - it's stuck with "Please wait" and the mouseover message says it is waiting for other human players (it's a singleplayer game obviously). It's not that it's just taking too long to complete, it seems to be stuck in some sort of infinite loop. I left it running for 10-15 minutes at one point with no luck.

When i get to this state I need to load a few turns back and change a few decisions. If I just do the same things, the game will hang again.

Anyone encountering this? Not sure if it's a problem with my particular save, gonna try to start another game.
