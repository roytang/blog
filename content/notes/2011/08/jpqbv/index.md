#### Posted on r/masseffect: [Mass Effect 1: Is there a way to modify your character model in the middle of the game?](https://reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/jpqbv/mass_effect_1_is_there_a_way_to_modify_your/)

Like a character editor or mod or whatever. I just became a Spectre (I guess not really the middle, more like a couple of hours in), but then I noticed something annoying on my FemShep's eyebrow texture and I want to change it. I just know I'm going to notice it all the time now.
