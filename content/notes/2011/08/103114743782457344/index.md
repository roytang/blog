So I say to myself: "Naya seems a viable deck to build in Modern!" but then I remembered that Tarmogoyf exists and is expensive

<time>[22:55]</time> I hope competitive MtG evolves to primarily support 3 formats: Modern, Standard with 4 years legality (what extended is now) and Block

<time>[23:01]</time> Well, maybe a 3 year Standard instead of 4. I don't see the point of the second rotating format other than block.
