#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [DC New 52: Teen Titans](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/ky827/dc_new_52_teen_titans/)

From the first issue it looks like Tim Drake and company will be establishing the Titans, does mean the previous incarnations of the team never existed in the DCNU? Cyborg heading straight to the JL seems to support this, but Red Hood and the Outlaws #1 is telling us Dick has been with Starfire before, though they can always retcon that to a non-Titans interaction

Thoughts?
