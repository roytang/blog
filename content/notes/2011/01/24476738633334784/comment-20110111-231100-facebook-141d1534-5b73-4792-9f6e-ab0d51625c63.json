  "text": "Some thoughts/suggestions:<br/>- Go to the BIOS, set everything back to factory defaults.<br/>- Check if your PC has any soft OCing software (e.g. Asus has it's own soft OCing program that by default auto OCs your CPU). If there's one, turn it off.<br/>- Check if there's enough airflow in and out of your case. Clean the airflow points of your case to ensure the air can go in and out easily.<br/>- Maybe the temps are high, but are still within the acceptable bounds of the chip?<br/>- Check if your CPU's heatsink got dislodged somehow (highly unlikely).<br/>- Replace your CPU's thermal paste.",
