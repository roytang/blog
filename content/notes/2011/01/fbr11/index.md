#### Posted on r/ipad: [Just got a stylus...suggestions?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/fbr11/just_got_a_stylussuggestions/)

The stylus is a Targus one...I plan to use the iPad for drawing/random doodling, but the only drawing app I have at the moment is Adobe Ideas. Any suggestions for good drawing/doodling apps (preferably free ones)?

Also, I'm using the official Apple case, but I'd like to be able to attach the stylus to the ipad somehow to avoid losing it...any ideas?
