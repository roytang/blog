  "text": "We're arguing over the semantics of \"idea\" now. If you say that an implementation is just a series of ideas then sure I'll accept that by that definition a sequence of ideas will have value. (Specifically, any  particular sequence of ideas has a much higher potential value than a single idea alone, since the combination has a higher uniqueness). I'm now going to disregard any parts of the discussion that include problems with our  different interpretations  of the words \"idea\" and \"cheap\"    My main problem with your assertions is really your claim that it is not  likely that anyone else aside from the wow guy would have thought of the  Mastery thing, out of all the millions of wow players, some of whom probably even have experience with game design and/or development, etc. I'm not  saying your idea does not have value or that you did not work on it, i.e.  I'm not trying to put you down, but that it's possible, even likely, that  some other people had thought of something similar (don't say it wouldn't be exactly the same as yours - I'm sure the wow talent masteries are not  exactly the same as yours) The very fact that the wow guy thought of the  concept independently of you should tell you already that it is probable  someone else would have thought of something similar.",
