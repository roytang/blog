  "text": "I still maintain that good ideas are not as cheap as you say. Inevitability of discovery and invention may be sired by their parents, curiosity and necessity, and raised in a culture that encourages these, but it does not make these golden ideas easy to make.    Because if your theory is indeed correct, then teleporters, warp drives, and certain other \"wish we had these\" ideas would've already evolved and turned into objects. What you believe is \"implementation \" is actually stringing a lot of good ideas together to form something substantial.    Just because two people invented the phone at nearly the same time does not mean that the telephone idea itself is rubbish, nor is it easy enough to grasp the concept of a telephone that \"anybody can invent it, if they put their mind to it.\"",
