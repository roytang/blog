  "text": "My point has always been the same as yours - just reversed. At what point do you separate action from the idea that gave birth to it? That is, ideas are \"just as important\" as the act, and not cheap, despite them being common. Because for an idea to be implemented, it must have first made sense. Non-light Teleporters do not still agree with our limited Science, so they haven't been invented yet. That breakthrough idea that will cause them to be acceptable in reality hasn't been stumbled upon yet.    \"My only assertion is that an idea by itself is not of value unless it is backed up by being acted upon.\" - Inverse is also true. An action cannot occur without an idea to give it foundation and the confidence to back it up. If good ideas that made sense to implement were a dime-a-dozen, then even if people were lazy to implement them (as you put it, everyone can think of said good idea, but they're just lazy/don't really want to do it), they'd find a \"lazy way\" of implementing things too, because you still can't deny the value gained. I say: They don't implement their ideas because they still don't make sense. The ideas they make are still labelled as \"Crazy\" or \"Pipedream\".",
