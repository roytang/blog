  "text": "You're still arguing semantics. Sure, for some definition of \"idea\" you can just say everything is an \"idea\", but we weren't discussing philosophy or anything were we? At what point do you separate idea from action?     Obviously we don't have teleporters, warp drives, etc. because at this point they are only concepts/ideas with no feasible implementation to back them up. My only assertion is that an idea by itself is not of value unless it is backed up by being acted upon.    I never said the idea of a telephone is rubbish, obviously it has been of great value to mankind, but it was the actual realization of that idea that gave it value. Sitting around and just thinking of the concept a telephone would not have given value to humanity.",
