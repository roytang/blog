  "text": "That is fine. I meant that entire example on WoW masteries to be nothing more than a fun anecdote anyway. We both will have difficulty proving it (if it is indeed provable or not). Though to say that I should've acted on it \"to make it mine\" is quite unfair. I have no rights to the game, and cannot naturally make changes to it. This is the same reason why I said that it is difficult for me to imagine that someone outside raised this to blizz, at the time frame I mentioned, because it involved such a radical change beyond the normal \"buff x, nerf y\" mentality and it would deviate from the established system. Again, not that it matters to me specifically if someone else did - though I still believe that they wouldn't give this much consideration during that time. An afterthought maybe, but not fully fleshed out (i.e. try to make it work and balanced, beyond the general concept). Not saying mine was balanced either, or fully thought of, and personally, I don't care anymore at this point.    It's ridiculous to remake something you do not own in your own image, and go so far as to try to imagine the string of ideas that will \"make it work\". And yes, I was being ridiculous. I did this as a game balance exercise that would make things more fun and I am glad that, stolen thunder feelings notwithstanding , it was implemented. The idea was validated.
