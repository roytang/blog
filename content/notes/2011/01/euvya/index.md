#### Posted on r/Steam: [Is there a way to find out how much space a game will take up on Steam before I download it?](https://reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/euvya/is_there_a_way_to_find_out_how_much_space_a_game/)

I have a guest pass for tf2, but I want to make sure I have enough disk space before I activate it so I don't waste time later.
