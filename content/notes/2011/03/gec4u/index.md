#### Posted on r/masseffect: [Are there any sales for Bioware points? Or any other way to get Mass Effect 2 DLC?](https://reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/gec4u/are_there_any_sales_for_bioware_points_or_any/)

So I got Mass Effect 2 via a Steam sale a while back, but I don't have the DLC like Overlord, Kasumi, etc. Is purchasing Bioware points the only way to buy them on PC? If so, do they at least have sales at any time? Or can we expect a price drop at least when ME3 comes out?
