Guys, if someone sends you chat message with a link, and it doesn't look like how your friend would usually send you something, don't click it and don't add any strange apps. You're just spamming the rest of us. 

For the record, it is IMPOSSIBLE for any app to tell you how many people are viewing your profile: http://www.facebook.com/help/?faq=12903, so stop clicking any link that says so.
