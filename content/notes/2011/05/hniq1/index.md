#### Posted on r/gaming: [(Casual gaming question) My mom has finished all of Angry Birds on the PC and is asking if I could recommend any games for her, looking for suggestions](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/hniq1/casual_gaming_question_my_mom_has_finished_all_of/)

Hopefully something cheap (if not free). Also, I can't give her anything that has time pressure (i.e. Plants vs Zombies) because she gets hypertensive sometimes when she tried playing stuff like Bejeweled or Text Twist.
