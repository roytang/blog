Not free, but for CBR/CBZ reading on an iPad, the best has been and remains Comic Zeal. The latest version allows folders and sub folders, sorting intuitive (easier if your comic series files are named consistently & well), and crisp speedy viewing.  I've tried tens of others and find CZ remains top dog. 

Read a few comics in the Zeal, you'll be happy once you get used to the UI.
