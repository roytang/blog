#### Posted on r/SteamGameSwap: [[H] 10 coals [W] games, see inside](https://reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/nsf2d/h_10_coals_w_games_see_inside/)

DX:HR or the Witcher 2 would be great if possible. Some other hopefuls:  Magicka (with all DLC preferably?), Audiosurf, Shogun 2, Might and Magic Clash of Heroes, SPAZ. Please don't ask me how many coals I want for a game, just make an offer.

I'll also consider other games, just make an offer here.

Thanks :D

Edit: I only get to check Reddit every few hours or so, so I may not reply immediately. Cheers.
