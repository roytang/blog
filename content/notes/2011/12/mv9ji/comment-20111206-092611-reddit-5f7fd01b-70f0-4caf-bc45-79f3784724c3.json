The latest version allows folders and sub folders, sorting intuitive (easier if your comic series files are named consistently & well), and crisp speedy viewing.  I've tried tens of others and find CZ remains top dog. \n\nRead a few comics in the Zeal, you'll be happy once you get used to the UI.",
