#### Posted on r/AskReddit: [Americans, do you shower/bathe every day?](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ifk9c/americans_do_you_showerbathe_every_day/)

I'm not sure why but my impression is that Americans don't usually shower or bathe on a daily basis. I live in a tropical country so that seems unthinkable to me.
