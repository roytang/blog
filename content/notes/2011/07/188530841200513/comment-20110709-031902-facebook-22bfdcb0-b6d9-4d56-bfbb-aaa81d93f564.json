  "text": "Sometimes the world looks perfect,   Nothing to rearrange.   Sometimes you get a feeling   Like you need some kind of change.   No matter what the odds are this time,   Nothing's going to stand in my way.   This flame in my heart,   And a long lost friend   Gives every dark street a light at the end!    Standing tall, on the wings of my dream.   Rise and fall, on the wings of my dream.     The rain and thunder   The wind and haze   I'm bound for better days.   It's my life and my dream,   Nothing's going to stop me now!",
