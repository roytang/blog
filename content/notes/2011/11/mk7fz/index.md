#### Posted on r/skyrim: [Bug in wolf queen v6 quest](https://reddit.com/r/skyrim/comments/mk7fz/bug_in_wolf_queen_v6_quest/)

So the library guy at the college asks me to find a copy of the wolf queen v6 at the folgunthur crypt. Trouble is i've already cleared this dungeon and have the book in my inventory, but i dont get the option to turn it in, and the quest marker still points to the empty chest in the crypt that i got it from. I tried putting it back in the chest (so i could pick it up again) but apparently i cant because its a quest item. Anything i can do about this?
