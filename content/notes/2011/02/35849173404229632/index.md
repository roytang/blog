I'm not sure why it is often so hard to decide to spend $0.99 on the app store!

<time>[07:56]</time> [@CapcomMobile](https://twitter.com/CapcomMobile/) the iPhone version is neat, but is there any chance of an iPad version for SF4 coming out?

<time>[23:44]</time> SF4 on the iPad is fun enough, although the non-HD ness of the graphics is obvious when playing at 2x. Good enough for 99c :D

Looks like the 99 cents for SF4 on the iPad was well-spent. It plays pretty well, I think it's even better on the iPad than it was on the iPhone. Oh, and it has GameCenter achievements! A hundred of them! Haha I'm such a sucker for this sort of thing. Achievements that is. Well, and Street Fighter as well.
