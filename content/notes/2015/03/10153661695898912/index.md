HOW TO LIVE WITHOUT REGRETS

Around the age of six, my guess is we form our first regret. Maybe we said something bad to our mother, or teacher, or a friend. 

We feel bad about it. 

Then as we get older we catalog more potential regrets. I yelled at my daughter. I betrayed a spouse. I didn't do so well for employees or investors. I lost money. I lost love. 

The first arrow will wound you (committing the action that causes the regret). But the second arrow can kill you (the regret). 

It's because you stay stuck in the time, stuck in the emotions that get magnified, stuck in the "what if" or "why did" or "if only I didn't". 

I know. I know because it's a battle every day to travel from the past to the present. To travel back from the future (where anxiety lives) to the present. 

To stay here and enrich your life right now by people around people you love, by doing things you love, by consuming the things you love. 

This is not a love song. This is how I have to live today. Or I disappear and become nothing.
