There was an incident during this event; since I was in a foreign country, communication wasn't great with some of the opponents. During round one I felt my opponent was being a bit shady and suspected he was drawing extra cards. At some point the tournament organizer took him aside and then he took his cards and left the table. The TO told me he was watching and also noticed the opponent was cheating and had been disqualified. In hindsight I'm very lucky that the TO decided to watch over the foreigner playing at his shop!
