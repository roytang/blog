Thanks to everyone who helped provide advice for my PC build. The final specs, if anyone is curious:  

- Case Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B 
- Fan 120mm internal aux fan 
- PSU Cooler Master B600 V2 600W 
- CPU Intel Core i5-4460 MB 
- ASUS H97ME RAM 2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600 
- VC Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb 
- SSD Samsung 850Evo 250gb 
- HDD Seagate 2tb  
 
Turned out quite expensive (#splurge), but hopefully I don't need to upgrade again for a long while, if at all
