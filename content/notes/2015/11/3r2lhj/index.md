#### Posted on r/buildapc: [Hello, planning to build a PC soon. Have put together a list of parts available from my local shop](https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3r2lhj/hello_planning_to_build_a_pc_soon_have_put/)

Case	Thermaltake Versa H25

PSU	Corsair V650W

CPU	Intel Core i5-4460

MB	ASUS H81M-D

RAM	2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600

VC	Inno3d GTX970 4gb

SSD	Kingston V300 240gb

HDD	Toshiba/Seagate 2tb SATA

Does this seem fine? I'm not sure if I have to consider anything about the power supply, or if any of these components have a bad reputation or something. Thanks!
