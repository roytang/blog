#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Anyone here have a flight out of NAIA during the APEC days that is *not* cancelled? Or anyone here from Cebu Pacific?](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/3t34ij/anyone_here_have_a_flight_out_of_naia_during_the/)

I have an international Cebu Pacific flight out of NAIA early morning on Nov 20 (4:50am). I'm from QC and plan to leave for the airport around 12mn-1am. I've just done the web check-in. My flight is *not* on Cebu Pacific's list of cancelled flights found here: https://www.cebupacificair.com/Pages/travel-advisory.aspx?id=110

Does anybody know:

- if there's any chance that my flight could still be affected despite not being on the list above? There's supposedly a no-fly zone, but I couldn't find any information on whether that's applicable 24 hours or what. 
- if I'll even be able to make it to the airport? There's some road closures on Airport Road I think? I'm not sure how my taxi would be able to get into NAIA T3.

I've tried calling the Cebu Pacific hotline to ask, but it seems their call center is always busy and I just end up spending a lot of time on hold. If anyone else here is successfully able to fly out of NAIA during the APEC days, that would help assuage my worry :p
