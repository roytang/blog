#### Posted on r/Steam: [Is there any way to filter my Steam library to see which games would be playable on a Mac?](https://reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/39stje/is_there_any_way_to_filter_my_steam_library_to/)

I'm considering getting a Macbook Pro, and want to see what games would be available on it.
