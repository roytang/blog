Egx was a welcome escape, although my feet are close to dead (hopefully I manage to get a seat on the train back to london). Didnt get to try too many games, the queues for the big aaa releases were ridiculous. Spent most of the time walking around and watching other people play. Nintendo booth was the most fun, I hung out at the sony one only for sfv. Lots of indies to see, some with very nice/clever premises
