  "text": "I haven't been inside WotC in years, so you'd have to ask them. I can tell you when we started the pro-tour we carefully looked at a HUGE range of sports/hobbies. We picked Magic to be toward the low end of those--i.e. didn't want folks to have to spend more than $X/year.\nBasketball was the cheapest of the major game brands we looked at but, it was surprisingly expensive.  You tend to think of it as free, but even some of the very poorest americans will buy 1 or 2 pairs of shoes each year at $100/pop.  The average spend with shoes and a basketball and the occasional court fee was over $200/year.  It's probably higher than that now.  We wanted Magic to be cheaper than tennis or golf or hunting or fishing.  Put it in with Baseball, etc.\nWe wanted with some low trading effort to make sure you were under $1000/year with Magic, and we achieved that.  I can't remember the exact figure (it was over $500 I think), but we pushed limited play very, very hard to get the number down even lower for those that draft.\nI have heard the amount you need to play has gone up--I can't really speak to the internal thoughts or what comparisons or studies they do today.  We did a ton in the old days--talked to sporting goods companies, professional sports marketing consultants, etc.\nWe wanted you to get well over your money's worth compared to movies, comic books, etc. but we started off with the thought that we could be a sport/hobby for a kid, not 'just a game'. The idea was to charge as much as for say baseball, and return that same amount of value for the player.",
