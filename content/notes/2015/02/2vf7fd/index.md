#### Posted on r/3DS: [Which one should I get: Devil Summoner Soul Hackers or Devil Survivor Overclocked?](https://reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/2vf7fd/which_one_should_i_get_devil_summoner_soul/)

I've played (and enjoyed) SMT4, P3P and P4G. I know there's different gameplay for Soul Hacker and Devil Survivor Overclocked, that's fine. I'll probably get both eventually. But which one is better to play first?
