  "text": "I wouldn't mind reading about an AU Superman with a secret agent Clark. His greatest limitation would be choosing how to use his powers in ways that don't break stealth or reveal that a creature like him exists... Imagine if Austin Powers discovered he were Kryptonian! That would rock.    ---Random thoughts    A more serious variant would be neat too.    Like, say he uses super hearing and vision to figure out some terrorist plot. He still needs to figure out human-plausible  ways to provide the chain of evidence to justify operations, and even during the occasional super-spy story where he's like James Bond, he'd have to hide his invulnerability  and super strength, etc.     And for certain crises, like alien invasions, etc, he would use the full extent of his powers, but still do so carefully to conceal his existence.     ---    But then, I still feel like Marvel and DC should switch over to the manga model and actually *End* storylines and characters and commit to coming up with and supporting novel characters....",
