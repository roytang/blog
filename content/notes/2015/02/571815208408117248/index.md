[@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) can I follow-up on the email I sent to talk@globe.com.ph last feb 16 pls. Subject is "RE: Case ID #5656525| Double billing"

[07:37] @YanyanOfGlobe it's all explained in the email

[07:40] @YanyanOfGlobe I had a P1000 payment via credit card that did not reflect in my feb bill

[07:41] @YanyanOfGlobe credit card via https://www.globe.com.ph/paybill.html

[07:44] @YanyanOfGlobe DM sent

[07:53] @YanyanOfGlobe you know what, I'd rather not do that over twitter. What's the # I should call to follow this up?

[08:18] @YanyanOfGlobe Can't you just ask someone with access to check the email w subject "Case ID #5656525| Double billing"?
