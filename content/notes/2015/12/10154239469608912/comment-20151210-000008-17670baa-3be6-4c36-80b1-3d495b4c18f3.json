        "text": "I'm confused. Are you claiming that all the alleged summary executions in Davao were by policemen whose lives were endangered because they were in pursuit of armed and dangerous criminals? I thought you said before that you had no personal knowledge of the killings?    BTW, since you decided to bring up this unrelated matter in a thread where I'm complaining about the way some supporters threaten other people online, I'd like to take my own tangent: What do you think of Duterte's stated preference of hero's burial for Marcos and house arrest for GMA?",

Your screenshot pertains to the \"extra judicial\" process many are angry about.  Hence...my post.  The why.  More than the what.  Get it now?  The root cause which is an ethics people are not as familiar about.    Anyway, as to burial and mode of imprisonment, I really dont care to be honest.  All I care about is his platform of fixing gornment via system shift to federal parliamentary which is a proven model to improve competence and accountability in government (ala Germany, Japan, Australia, Singapore, etc).  Ans improving drastically our GDP per capita via open market economics (as countries above do).",

        "text": "Er, I legitimately don't understand what you're claiming by asking me to watch that video. It talks about the legality of police officers shooting to kill criminals who are armed and dangerous. Am I correct that you are claiming that *all* the supposed DDS killings were done by policemen in the line of duty in self-defense against armed and dangerous criminals? AFAIK not even Duterte himself claims that. This video seems to be speaking about one particular instance only (IDK the context)",

All I am saying is, there is a system of ethics applied on each case.  Which we can trust or not.  Kami sa Davao, we arent scared at all for a PolPot or Ferdi Marcos scenario.  We trust the system of ethics applied due to the lawlessness context we suffered as a city.  Kayo lang mga nasa Manila cant relate.  Understanable of course.  And at the end of the day, it is a question of trust.  Cant force you to trust or not.",
