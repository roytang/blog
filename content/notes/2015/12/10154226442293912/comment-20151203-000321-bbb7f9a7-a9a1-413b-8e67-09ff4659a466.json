A stern warning that if repeats it, he knows what will happen.  If the criminal who was caught in the act still repeats the crime, thats it.  There is no other way to protect the next victim.    And by the way, our current criminal justice system does not work.  Think mapansano, saf44, pdaf, dap.    The question at the end of the day is, when will this stop?",
