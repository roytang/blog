A church goer being shot a few aisles away.  Blood all over the floor. Beheaded corpses in the farm road, floating bodies on the river which ironically meant being &quot;salvaged&quot; or saved.  An aunt kidnapped and killed.  All these in Davao before Duterte came into power.  And you criticize him as if you know all about what &quot;could happen&quot;?  Your fears are overbloated.  Just look at Davao now pare.  Your fears will have a sense of proportion.  And not base it on what could happen.  But on reality.      Again, your fears are out of proportion.  I invite you to read up on what he was able to do for Davao.  Actions speaks louder than &quot;what ifs&quot;.",
