  "text": "My belief is that Duterte must have a vice president to temper his power lust if ever he will be tempted by the devil. My vice president is Leni Robredo because she is a lawyer, so she knows the rule of law, she is a staunch critic of Duterte so she will be a good counter balance. She is modest enough to let her leader Jesse Robredo implement the Tsinelas governance although she have some platform of her own. She was chosen by Mar to be his running mate even though there are hundreds of senior politicians on their party wanting to be vice president because she is the best example of &quot;Matuwid na Daan&quot; leadership.",
