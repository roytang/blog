        "text": "I know you like him, and I don't expect to convince you of anything.    To me, he's dangerous, actually the least desirable and most dangerous of the candidates up for election. There's a decent chance he's a mass murderer. Extra-judicial killings, even of alleged criminals, is pretty terrible, and for all that there is outward peace, how many innocent people might be swept up in a country in which the president feels free to use secret police to execute people he feels has broken the law?     I don't care about the things he says and his personal life, but electing Duterte means believing that it's ok for one man to decide, regardless of legal protections, whether it's ok for this person or that person to die. We already had a president like that, and his son is running for VP.    My fellow Filipinos are so strange to me sometimes. Most are anti-abortion (and even anti-contracept ion), but they're ok with casually murdering suspected (not even proven) criminals, and the only reason Duterte is being attacked in the media now is because of inconsequential  things he's said and the things he's done in his personal life.    Incompetence and corruption are things that everyone in the Philippines deals with on a regular basis. All the other candidates will give at worst, more of the same, but Duterte could easily turn this country into a state where things are good for a lot of people, but undesirables (decided upon by only him) are eliminated.     https://www.hrw.org/news/2015/07/17/rodrigo-duterte-rise-philippines-death-squad-mayor",

        "text": "I'll say one more thing about why Duterte is the absolute worst choice.    Let's suppose we get the best case (unlikely) scenario, that Duterte is genuinely good and uncorruptible and that somehow he will be able to apply his death squad approach to crime across an entire country of 100 million without ever making mistakes about people \"caught in the act\" (an utterly ridiculous thing that can be made up any time you have one unpopular person and a group willing to be witnesses against him/her). He never abuses this ridiculous power, despite the complete lack of oversight or consequences for mistakes.     [Also, how can you say he is pro-accountabil ity when he himself has no accountability for the people he executes?]    That means there is going to be a new branch of government that exceeds all others in power over life and death, which answers only to the president.    OK. Duterte did good. Then his term is over.    What then? What happens with this secret police? Does it keep on answering only to Duterte even when his term is up? Does it then answer to the next president who starts to use it against inconvenient \"political dissidents\" or trouble-making unionizers? How many of those Judge Dredd types in his squad stick around and become addicted to this power?     Congrats, you have just broken democracy completely, again, instead of trying to fix what is flawed.    For every Lee Kuan Yew authoritarian who is actually effective and restrained, we get countless inept and cruel warlords and tyrants scattered around the world.",
