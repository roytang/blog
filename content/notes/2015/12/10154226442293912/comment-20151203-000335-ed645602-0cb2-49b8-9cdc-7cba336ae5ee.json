  "text": "The only reason you and I are free to talk about this on Facebook is that democracy still somewhat functions. You are choosing a murderer who only happens to kill those you don&#x27;t like, but they have rights too, and there&#x27;s no knowing how many times he screwed up and killed an innocent.    With people like that, there is no guarantee that he will only keep killing the people you don&#x27;t like. There is no oversight now and there will be total impunity if he becomes president.    And when he is gone, you will be left with government assassins who can kill whomever the next president likes.",
