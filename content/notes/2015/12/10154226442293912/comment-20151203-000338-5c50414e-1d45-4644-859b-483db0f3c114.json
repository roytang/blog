If it were you and me, we cant do what he is doing for the simple fact that we are not deputized enforcers of the law.  As to Davao, there was &quot;just cause&quot;.  It was a lawless case that needed an iron hand to solve.  Otherwise we have more death and chaos.  On the national context, the amount of corruption is equal to a high crime with the amount involved in the context of massive poverty.  It is outrageous.  So outrageous that I want a rottweiler to put order again.  Or even for the first time.  He wont be a Marcos and I know that because of what Davao has become.  There is empirical evidence.  Just go there.  You will see.",
