I don't need further convincing on his platforms. Most are ok, some might not scale or be practical on a nationwide level but are worth a try. 

But I'm not going to vote for him unless he categorically states he has never been involved in nor does he condone any illegal killings and will bring such perpetrators/vigilantes to justice
