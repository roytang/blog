  "text": "Nde ako galit. I just genuinely don't know what you're looking for.    Here's a few more biases, if it helps:    I am biased towards a nation of laws not men    I am biased towards meat over vegetables    I am biased against people who think the reported DDS killings are justifiable (of which Duterte seems to be one)    I am biased against people who threaten rape or violence against other people    I am biased against embarassing people in public over their weaksauce arguments    I am biased towards education over violence    I am biased against people who think extrajudicial killings are not an issue    I am biased towards Star Wars over Star Trek    A bias is not in and of itself bad, since all people have biases. It only becomes a problem when you don't recognise you have that bias and thus don't compensate for it. Which is why (and I'm already repeating myself here), I'm taking the time to research and discuss these killings so that I can see if my bias against Duterte for supporting them is not justified, or if the good can outweight the bad. So far it has not    Since all people have biases, accusing people of holding biases in any discussion is meaningless and irrelevant. The point is to try and make an objective decision on matters in spite of your biases",
