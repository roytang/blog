  "text": "Roy, minimize what? What are you actually saying? Your words betray a bias already so, no, you are not a mere outsider with goodwill trying to  stand on a good PoV? You cannot continue on your tack as HR crusader if you apply that selectively. Why since 2009? perhaps because there are those who wish to replace Digong as Mayor in Davao City before 2009, have you considered that? i don't like dealing with \"perhaps\" and \"maybes\".. so why don't we  stick to the facts? there are allegations but they have remained allegation for at least 6 years, going with your 2009 year. Tagal na yang allegations before the new millenia pa yan.. maraming gusto pumalit kay Digong as Mayor ng Davao one in fact rose to Speaker of the House, a formidable foe. So, wether international(A I) or local(CHR), allegations are allegations and it is diserespectful,  at the vetry least, to imply guilt to a person/s with nothing but stories.",
