  "text": "Nick Solana  please consider the POV of an outsider looking in. The residents say they feel safe, yet there are these reports of killings going on especially among the poorer residents (the article talks specifically about the slums). We can't find any articles about whether these killings have already been solved or addressed, yet the residents claim that Davao has a lot of peace and order. Ano naman yung possibleng motive, for an article written in 2009, and with other reports from international bodies, to try to defame a man who was not involved in national-level politics at that time? I'm not asking that Duterte be executed for these killings, nor do I have any evidence that he is involved. But the mere fact that these have supposedly gone on under his watch and that by his very words he appears to condone and/or approve of them, or has not shown any significant steps to minimize them, is that not in and of itself a problem? When he speaks of executing petty criminals, even if it's just hyperbole, does he not encourage a culture of violence and impunity?",
