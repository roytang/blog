It's really an issue that the supporters refuse to see. Most will either (a) deny the killings are even occurring; or (b) condone the killings because "only criminals need to be afraid"; or (c) claim the killings are done "in self-defense" or otherwise legally acceptable. 

It's like an entire generation raised to ignore or accept the executions simply because they affect people in the slums who are supposedly criminals (which even then would not be justified!) or who are not well off. It's not like these reports are politically motivated either, there are reports from international authorities
