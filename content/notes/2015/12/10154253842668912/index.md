As is tradition, my spoiler-free review of The Force Awakens: 

- rewatching the original trilogy immediately before this one was well worth it 
- wow a lot of beautiful shots and landscapes, from beginning to end 
- the heart of the true Star Wars fan will skip a beat every time the background music comes up 
- it feels like coming home. A lot of familiar elements, interspersed with the new. A nice way to transition into a new trilogy 
- I often wonder what it must have felt like to watch the original Star Wars: A New Hope in the theaters back then. This is how I imagined it to be 
- Try not to think about the fact that Episode VIII won't come until 2017 :D 
- quite possibly the best movie of 2015 
- on the ride home I was like: Ten ten tenetenenten tenetenenten tentenenten ... (okay, maybe I was like that before the movie too)

- ...  
- 
- ...yeah, it was ok :D
