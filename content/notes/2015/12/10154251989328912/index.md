Finally finished watching Jessica Jones. It started out a bit slow, but the pace picked up after a few episodes. It's a different kind of grimdark than Daredevil was, but everything about the plot was great and tight. I was worried about what they planned to do with Kilgrave but it turned out he might have been a better villain here than Fisk was in Daredevil
