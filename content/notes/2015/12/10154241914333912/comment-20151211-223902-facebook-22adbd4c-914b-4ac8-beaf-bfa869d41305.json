Wish they could get Vin Diesel even  =P  Would be amusing for Groot to also be big blue.    Oh yeah, also, Ron Perlman! Then HellBoy would also be the biggest X-Men baddie....    Random aside: best big booming voice of all time probably still belongs to the late and awesome Christopher Lee, who was tall enough, but way too thin to be Apocalypse....     https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvKRbi2ovDY",
