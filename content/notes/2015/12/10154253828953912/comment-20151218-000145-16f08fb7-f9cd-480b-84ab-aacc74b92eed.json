  "text": "Hmm, I get mixed feels on not-so-competen t Ren.

But even after training with Yoda in 5, Vader manhandles him and easily chops his hand off. Actually, not sure what the canon says, but my headcanon is that Luke was on Dagobah for weeks while Han and Leia were fixing the Falcon and then waiting around while Lando gave them the runaround  =P    So, Ren being the only apprentice of Snoke we see (another minor quibble: kind of a lousy name) is a bit underwhelming given that total zero training Rey gets force visions from just touching a lightsaber and can instantly handle herself. Even with the wounded KR.",
