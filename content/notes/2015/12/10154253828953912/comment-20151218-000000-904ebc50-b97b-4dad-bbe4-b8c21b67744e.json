The bits on the desert world were beautiful. And I like that Finn and Rey are platonic. I also like how much more real the stormtroopers seem.    I don't mind the setup with the resistance, Republic and First Order. It makes sense--the Republic is the new government in regions where the Empire totally folded, the First Order is where Imp forces retained control, and Resistance are funded partisans in FO territory.    Minor quibbles: the Han-Ren scene got milked for too long. It's a bit ridiculous that the FO have this planet sized super death star but no fleet to protect it. Wish Han found them on the Falcon because he was searching for it and not due to random chance. And Rey is ridiculously force talented, able to defeat an experienced darksider with zero training.",

        "text": "Hmm, I get mixed feels on not-so-competen t Ren. Kinda feel like, if he's that so-so, hopefully we see other darksiders in the next movies, but most likely he'll be supposed to suddenly be boosted from 'completing his training.'    Like, in ep. 4, Luke is trained just enough to touch the Force, and he uses it to be super-pilot. But even after training with Yoda in 5, Vader manhandles him and easily chops his hand off. Actually, not sure what the canon says, but my headcanon is that Luke was on Dagobah for weeks while Han and Leia were fixing the Falcon and then waiting around while Lando gave them the runaround  =P    So, Ren being the only apprentice of Snoke we see (another minor quibble: kind of a lousy name) is a bit underwhelming given that total zero training Rey gets force visions from just touching a lightsaber and can instantly handle herself. Even with the wounded KR.",

My headcanon of Rey's affinity to the force is that maybe she's already started Jedi training with Luke at a very young age. Then KR went batshit crazy - halting Luke's next-gen Jedi training and forces him into hiding.    At least that's what went through my head when the visions/ flashbacks were shown. But yeah - considering KR has enough skill with the Force to stop a freakin' blaster shot - it's a bit hard to reconcile. Even with his injury. Haha.",

I was thinking psychometry at a really high level, like not just getting memories out of touching objects, but also skills. Like the (oh he's not blind, just frail) guy, Kaos, in Alita. It would also allow her to self educate just from touching things.    I think of the blaster bolts as plasma, so while the stopped blast could still have energy for a while, it ought to have rapidly flickered away as it lost energy to the atmosphere. So, sf think: stopped time, or he contained its energy perfectly without losing any while he was stalking around and talking.",
