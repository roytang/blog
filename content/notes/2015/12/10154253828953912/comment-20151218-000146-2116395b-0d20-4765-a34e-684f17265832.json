My headcanon of Rey&#x27;s affinity to the force is that maybe she&#x27;s already started Jedi training with Luke at a very young age. Then KR went batshit crazy - halting Luke&#x27;s next-gen Jedi training and forces him into hiding.    At least that&#x27;s what went through my head when the visions/ flashbacks were shown. But yeah - considering KR has enough skill with the Force to stop a freakin&#x27; blaster shot - it&#x27;s a bit hard to reconcile. Even with his injury. Haha.",
