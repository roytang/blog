  "text": "Just a few cents here, I have to say that Binay doesn't care about the online crowd that much. What percentage of the total voters are using social media? Binay's focus will be religious groups and (more importantly) the poor. Most of the FB/Twitter crowd already know who he is and what he's done so there's little use discrediting him anymore in such mediums. As such, there should be more focus on putting up physical items that people can see in the streets, especially in poorer locales.\n\nIt'll still be useful for posting on a few pages that are pro-Binay like the Anti-Grace Poe or the Anti-Mar Roxas pages but that will reach only a thousand at best.\n\nI could be wrong tho.",
