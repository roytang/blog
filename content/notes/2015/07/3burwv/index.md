#### Posted on r/Steam: [I'm from Asia and will be travelling to Europe for work for a few months. Will I have any problem with Steam?](https://reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/3burwv/im_from_asia_and_will_be_travelling_to_europe_for/)

I assume I will be able to play my Steam games. Will I have any trouble with purchases or using the same credit card I've always used at home?
