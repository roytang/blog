#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Where to buy singles in London?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/3f2cqe/where_to_buy_singles_in_london/)

Hello,

If there is a more appropriate subreddit for this, feel free to advise.

I'm travelling for work and will be in London for a few months. I get to play in a GP while I'm here, yay!

However, i need a few more cards to fill out my standard deck. Can some kind London MTG'er tell me where is a good place to buy singles? Either a brick and mortar store or a good online place that can deliver within London.

I'm in East London near Stratford, if that matters. Thanks!
