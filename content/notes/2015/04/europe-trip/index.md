    the detailed guide for  this piece and thus spent some extra time here

  title: Diana of the Hunt. There's a replica of this statue in the hall of mirrors
    in Versailles
- src: monalisa.jpg
  title: Apparently there's always a big crowd around the Mona Lisa. I honestly found
    it a bit underwhelming, given how famous it is.
- src: coronation-of-napoleon.jpg
  title: The Coronation of Napoleon ended the first audioguide tour we had decided
    to follow. The painting is huge and there were lots of details to take in

    very fond of selfies somehow

  title: The Hall of Battles was easily my favorite thing in the Chateau, I paid attention
    to each of the battles/paintings discussed by the audioguide. Typically, I have
    already forgotten most of the information, but I was well entertained

    It was ridiculously cold at the top too, my hoodie was nowhere near enough

  title: A display atop the tower showed the distance from different capital cities
    around the world, and the height of the highest building there, for comparison
    to the Eiffel. I have no idea what this Stratford Residences is though

    hand. I would have pretended to lose my hand, but the guy ahead of us in the queue
    already did that gag
