This one of those set of rules that while I don't know formally, I kind of know what sounds wrong and what doesn't, probably from reading too much. It's kind of grating sometimes because when someone is using the prepositions in the wrong way, I don't always know the rule to correct them with (if I can be bothered to correct them)
