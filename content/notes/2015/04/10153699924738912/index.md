Daredevil was okay. Pacing felt a bit off in some places, but the fight scenes were great and the Matt - Foggy bromance was well-portrayed. Certainly a better treatment than a two-hour movie could afford, given the nature of Matt Murdock's relationships. A number of threads were left hanging for future series to pick up, but the ending was satisfying enough. I would have hoped for something bigger, but maybe we'll get that in Defenders
