I have loved the character of Daredevil since I was a little boy. Outside of Batman, Daredevil probably has more great comic book arcs than any other character.  From [Frank Miller](https://www.facebook.com/Frank-Miller-112763798737251/) and [David Mazzucchelli](https://www.facebook.com/David-Mazzucchelli-104040496297854/) to [Kevin Smith](https://www.facebook.com/YesThatKevinSmith) to [Ed Brubaker](https://www.facebook.com/Ed-Brubaker-108461452512419/) and on and on, the character has elicited some of the best work from some of the greatest comic book storytellers. 

So I was a bit frightened last night when I dug into the new [Marvel's Daredevil](https://www.facebook.com/Daredevil/) Netflix series. I'm a rough TV critic - I love five or so shows on the air right now, but that's about it - and I didn't want to see one of my favorite characters come up short. On top of that I really like [Steven S. DeKnight](https://www.facebook.com/Steven-S-DeKnight-112980332046246/), the showrunner, and [Drew Goddard](https://www.facebook.com/Drew-Goddard-108207169201395/), the creator, both as people and as creative forces (Spartacus, Cloverfield, Cabin in the Woods, etc).

Well, I love it. The cast is great. [Charlie Cox](https://www.facebook.com/Charlie-Cox-104097699625971/) is just awesome, and Elden Henson is about as an amazing a Foggy as I could have imagined. The fight sequences stand alongside Spartacus and Rome as some of the best TV fight sequences ever (so, the best TV fight sequences ever not performed in togas).  And the scripts have been touching and on point and true to the character.  In the first few episodes, I cried twice: once in a scene between young Matt and battling Jack, and again when I realized this character I loved so much for so long had been brought to television with such spirit, love, and care.

What I'm saying is, there's a huge [Marvel](https://www.facebook.com/Marvel/) event going on right now, and it's Daredevil on [Netflix](https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/)  I hope you guys check it out.
