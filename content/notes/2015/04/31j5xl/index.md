#### Posted on r/homeland: [Some questions from Season 1](https://reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/31j5xl/some_questions_from_season_1/)

I'm up-to-date, but my friend is binging and is up to the start of S3 and I don't have answers to all her questions. Help me reddit!

Was it ever revealed who slipped the razor blade to Brody's captor? Was it brody himself?

Who warned Raqim Faisel and Aileen Morgan about the raid on the safehouse?
