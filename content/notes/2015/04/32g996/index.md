#### Posted on r/television: [Why is now more common for weekly shows to skip some weeks or take midseason breaks?](https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/32g996/why_is_now_more_common_for_weekly_shows_to_skip/)

...or has this been common since before the 2000s?

A friend of mine contends it might be because of the writer strike in 2008, they're more confident that audiences can tolerate breaks.
