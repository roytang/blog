NOT:  "..ads splattered on the sides of Muni buses, purchased by blogger Pamela Gellerâ€™s American Freedom Defense Initiative, are again all over San Francisco...equate Islam with Nazism." 

The ads now feature Kamala Khan, Marvel's Comics first Muslim character to headline her own comic book with messages against islamophobia, racism and hate speech and a group of protestors calling for more love.  Enjoy.
