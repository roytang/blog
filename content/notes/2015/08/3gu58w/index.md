#### Posted on r/ipad: [Is there a way for me to use an Apple account on the iTunes store without specifying a payment method?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/3gu58w/is_there_a_way_for_me_to_use_an_apple_account_on/)

I'm in the UK for a few months so I thought I'd try Netflix, which we don't have where I live. I created a UK apple account so that I could download Netflix from the app store, but apparently I must enter payment info first and of course I don't have a UK credit card to use.

I don't have access to a PC during the trip so I can't do anything that requires the use of anything other than my iPad. Am I shit out of luck?

Edit: After a chat with apple support, I was able to create a new account with no payment details, as explained by /u/anchorboi
