It's excellent against both Hangarback Walker and Ensoul Artifact. Versus RDW: Bouncing an attacker and surprise block on another can be a huge play, especially if you're simultaneously gaining 4 life from Ojutai's Command. It can bounce Jace or Chandra with their flip trigger on the stack.\n\nI wouldn't go overboard with it. Maybe 1-2 in the main, perhaps in place of Rabblemaster.",
