  "text": "Lol it's not really the sort of thing that should be the subject of a presidential run. More like congress needs to legislate a new post like governor of metro manila, someone in charge of overall development. Supposedly the MMDA is in charge of that (hence the name), but they don't have any real authority so the local governments and other executive branch entities dont really cooperate with them too much",
