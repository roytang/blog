Wow I didn't realize the old notes can only be used until the end of this year

{{% quoted url="https://www.facebook.com/govph//posts/954390007938596" label="Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines's Facebook post" %}}

The old banknote series launched in 1985 can still be used for daily transactions up to December 31, 2015. From January 1, 2016 up to December 31, 2016, the old banknotes can still be exchanged in authorized agent banks and the BSP Cash Department. However, starting January 1, 2017, the old banknote series will be fully demonetized or without monetary value. More details: http://bit.ly/1HWksHo
