As a personal rule, if you are having a hard time deciding over two small yet important/ urgent tasks, pick one at random. Effort spent debating on tasks that demand less than an hour is sub optimal compared to just doing one or the other.    Adjust &quot;debate time&quot; accordingly for bigger tasks at a ratio of 1 min per expected hour spent doing it.",
