#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [[SPOILERS][Discussion] Hickman's Avengers / New Avengers run discussion (Spoilers ahoy!)](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/34gh4t/spoilersdiscussion_hickmans_avengers_new_avengers/)

Now that it's wrapped up, is there a clean summary of everything that's been going on in Hickman's run so far? 

I think I understand most of it, but I was confused with some things in both of the last issues:

New Avengers - it is mentioned that Molecule Man is the fuse used by the Beyonders to bring about the end of universes. In that case, why are there incursions? And if Doom had been able to kill at least a thousand Molecule Men, shouldn't there be at least a thousand universes that survive?

Avengers - Steve says that Tony knew about it all from the beginning. How does he know this? How did Tony know? And when the incursion is imminent, they're preparing for escape as if there was no hope of survival. But isn't it that between 616 and 1610, one of those universes will survive the last incursion? 

Feel free to discuss anything else about the run!
