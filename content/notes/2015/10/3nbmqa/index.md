#### Posted on r/gaming: [Recommend me a platformer](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3nbmqa/recommend_me_a_platformer/)

I am looking for a platformer with the following criteria:

- preferably 2D
- focus on exploration and collecting hidden items, instead of on difficult platforming (i.e. not Super Meat Boy)
- with achievements
- on Steam, PS3, PS4 or Vita

Thanks!
