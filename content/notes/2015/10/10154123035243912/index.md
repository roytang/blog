> "Instead of buying into the idea that you must keep achieving, that you must continue to move towards an ideal of intelligence or beauty or success, just stop. Stop everything you are doing and just exist for a minute. It is easy to get trapped into thinking about everything that is not the here-and-now, when in reality all you should be thinking about is the here and now."
