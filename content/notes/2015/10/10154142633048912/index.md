Things software development projects can learn from "The Martian" (maybe spoilers lol): 

- If you rush things, you might leave something behind that will cost you a lot more later 
- You need to have buffer in your schedule for the inevitable disasters 
- If you have impossible deadlines, limited resources, overworked staff, and decide to skip testing to meet deadlines, don't expect things to go smoothly 
- If your stuff doesn't work, see if there's some Chinese alternative. Or look for some sort of coffee-powered genius to come up with a miracle solution 
- If you make a unpopular decision, your staff might go off on their own and risk their lives trying to complete the mission 
- Problems will occur at almost every step, be prepared to make stuff up as you go along 
- Solve one problem at a time until you get to go home
