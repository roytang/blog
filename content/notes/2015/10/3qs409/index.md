#### Posted on r/Philippines: [What's the best shop in SM North cyberzone for putting together a new desktop?](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/3qs409/whats_the_best_shop_in_sm_north_cyberzone_for/)

Yun tipong I bring them a list of parts I want (and probably my old graphics card and hard drive) tapos sila na magassemble for me

Edit: I've assembled multiple desktops myself, I don't want to do it anymore. SM North Cyberzone para I can do a price check while I'm there running errands.
