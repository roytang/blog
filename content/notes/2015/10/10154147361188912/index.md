Rody Duterte A little over two years ago, I posted in the government website over the Internet that I was not interested in the Presidency.  Nothing has changed. I am comfortable where I am now.  If Inday Sara would want it, she has the choice of running in 2016 or the next election. Personally, the earlier the better. I want to retire. I am tired. Give the presidency to the one who wants it. I donâ€™t.
