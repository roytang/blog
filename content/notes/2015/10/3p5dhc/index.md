#### Posted on r/Steam: [Steam Cloud Saves question](https://reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/3p5dhc/steam_cloud_saves_question/)

I have been playing Shadownrun Dragonfall DC on a laptop I borrowed, with Steam cloud synchronization enabled. But now I have to give back the laptop and haven't finished it yet. If I uninstall Steam from this laptop (and all the games of course) then go back to my desktop which doesn't have have Shadowrun Dragonfall DC installed yet and install it there, will it get the saves I had from the laptop?

Thanks!
