title: "PopQuiz 7th Anniversary: The Last Seven Years"
---

Last night (Thursday) was PQ's 7th anniversary quiz; each round features pop culture questions from one of the past seven years (or two years for the pandemic). This quiz also had a gimmick where **for each question**, the teams would vote (by raising some cards) whether the question should be about "Movies", "TV/Streaming", "Music" or "People, Events and Things" of the appropriate era. We could have done better if only people didn't keep choosing Music lol

Rounds were:

1. 2016 - 5pts
2. 2017 - 5pts
3. 2018 - 2pts
4. 2019 - 6pts (x2 for power-up)
5. 2020-2021 (pandemic years) - 6pts
6. 2022-present - 5pts
7. Hail Mary - Taylor Swift album titles - 8pts
   
We were surprised we qualified for HM. That got our total to 41pts by our count, but in the final tally they listed us in 4th place with 45pts. We did not contest as it did not affect the rankings.
