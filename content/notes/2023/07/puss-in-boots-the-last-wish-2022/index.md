<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/2/2/8/5/242285-puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9e9109c5cd" /></p> <p>Watched the first half of this with my niece a couple of months ago, finally decided to finish it today. Kind of by-the-numbers plot, but it's a fun adventure with clever adaptations of classic fairy tales (as we've come to expect from the Shrek franchise) + some truly vibrant, fantastic and unique animations that more than make up for it.</p>
