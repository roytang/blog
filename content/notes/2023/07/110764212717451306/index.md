<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://indieweb.social/@fury" class="u-url mention">@<span>fury</span></a></span> I started to write a response with some suggestions, but then thought it might be better as a blog post lol</p><p>some quick thoughts though:</p><p>- if you&#39;re having trouble putting thoughts into words, it might just be a matter of practice and you might want to just dive into it without thinking too much about getting things perfect or expressing yourself well, just write and get the practice in</p>

<time id="110764214730950592">[23:56]</time> <p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://indieweb.social/@fury" class="u-url mention">@<span>fury</span></a></span> <br />- a lot of the &quot;work&quot; in blogging happens even before you sit down to write. for me i often let ideas collect and simmer in my head for a while before sitting down to write a blog post, and at that point they kind of just fall into the page and then I just sort of stitch them together</p><p>I hope my suggestions made sense and were helpful!</p>
