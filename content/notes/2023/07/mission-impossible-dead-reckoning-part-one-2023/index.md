<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/3/4/0/2/503402-mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=800fc297c1" /></p> <p>Each Mission Impossible seems to have a signature stunt/scene to remember it by, like the hanging from the ceiling bit in the first film or climbing the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol. This one for sure will be remembered by the bike jump off the cliff; it's only too bad it was heavily promoted in trailers and previews, so there is little to no surprise when he actually does it in the film.</p><p>I liked the set pieces in Rome and the final train sequence (though it reminds me of a certain Playstation game.) Venice felt weak. The rest was okay.</p><p>Decent performances all around, even though all the exposition bits felt a bit stretched out. Cruise does his usual thing, though I feel like his age is starting to show a bit. (He has been doing these films for 27 years now!) At first I did not recognize that one lady as Pom Klementieff, although I've only ever seen her as Mantis so that's unsurprising.</p><p>The plot is pretty straightforward ("find the mcguffin"), enough so that my parents who I watched the film with had minimal questions for me afterwards. (They were mostly confused with the how and why of Pom Klementieff's character!)</p><p>All in all an entertaining film.</p>
