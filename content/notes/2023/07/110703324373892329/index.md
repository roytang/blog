<p>Sadly a no internet morning for me as <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/globe" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>globe</span></a> fiber has been down since midnight. Already reported, lets see how good their response time is.</p><p>Also yesterday we lost electricity for most of the morning so the week is going great lol</p>
