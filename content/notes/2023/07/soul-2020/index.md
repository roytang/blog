<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/8/5/1/1/438511-soul-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=8d0b74f9a8" /></p> <p>Watched the first half of this with my niece about a month ago and finally decided to finish it today. I had zero idea what this film was about and thought it would be about jazz and music and such, but it turned out to be about life and death and living and inspiration and purpose. It's okay and the ending is kinda sweet but it feels a bit average for a Pixar film.</p>
