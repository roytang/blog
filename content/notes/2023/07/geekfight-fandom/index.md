We attended Geekfight @ Hobby Stadium again last night. I felt confident about two of the categories, but I did poorly.

Rounds were:

1. Isekai - 3pts
2. Barbie - 7pts
3. America - 7pts
4. BTS - 4pts
5. Street Fighter - 4pts, x2 for joker. I was confident in my stock knowledge here so I jokered, but apparently they knew my weaknesses: remembering move names and character theme music!
6. Lord of the Rings - 1pt. Lol I even prepped for this one by watching Rings of Power and rewatching the original trilogy, but I was still unprepared for all the deep cuts.

We count 30pts, but they only gave us 29. We did not bother contesting.

Also, I must note that because of the recent MTG crossovers with other properties (via Secret Lairs / Universes Beyond), it is more likely that random MTG card questions appear in unrelated topics: we got 2 here in LotR and 1 in SF, and the annoying thing is these aren't usually tournament playable cards so they are ones I'm not very familiar with!
