We attended Geekfight at a new venue, which was a bit inconveniently located.

1. "DA-DAN~! Daniel Radcliffe" by Glerren ðŸ¤“ - 3pts 
2. "We're All in This Together" by PJCðŸ’¡- 9pts (x2 for joker)
3. "To the Moon and Back" by Moon Rabbit ðŸŒ™ - 5pts
4. "BGM (Bidyo Game Mixtape)" by Earle ðŸŽ¶ - 0pts (luckily we chose not to joker here lol)
5. "It's Art!" by Caroline ðŸŽ¨ - 6pts
6. "Trese" by Dant - 5pts

We counted 36pts for us, but they initially announced as at 35pts (first and second were at 36 and 37 respectively) which meant we had to contest, which was a bit awkward as second place prizes were already awarded by the time we resolved it and had to split prizes. Still, happy to have done relatively well, I had low expectations for this one.
