Sigh. Threw some gems away on the Arena Open again, attempts no. 2 and 3. First pool looked decent, but I had some bad misplays that cost me a couple of games, finished 2-3. Second pool had some good rares in shallow colors, I went RW for more consistency, but only went 1-3.

Someday we'll get there!
