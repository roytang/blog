 (@Artscience Museum 10 Bayfront Av)

 We attended the FutureWorld: Where Art Meets Science show. It was pretty neat, lots of pretty interactive light displays. There was a thing that was like a lot of single-tile suspension bridges strung together (I dared not attempt it!). Fun activities for kids as well.
