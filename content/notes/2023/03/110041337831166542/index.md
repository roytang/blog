<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://occult.institute/@maya" class="u-url mention">@<span>maya</span></a></span> I can appreciate why such features can be too much for the average casual reader of a personal website who are unlikely to ever click through to category/topic pages. </p><p>But I think they are great for the site author to be able to look back and view his own site content filtered through a particular lens, especially if your site has a lot of old content. I would never give them up!</p>
