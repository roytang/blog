<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/2/8/8/46288-my-cousin-vinny-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=8444588281" /></p> <p>Watched this one because I recently read about how Marisa Tomei's oscar win was a bit controversial because she was a newcomer. I really enjoyed the film and the way it set up expectations for Vinny's courtroom smackdown in the third act. Not sure if Oscar-worthy, but both Tomei and Pesci gave good performances, especially with Mona Lisa on the stand. Thoroughly enjoyable!</p>
