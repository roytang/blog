 (@SEA Aquarium 8 Sentosa Gateï»¿way Resorts World Sentosa)

 We were originally planning to go to Adventure Cove, but the weather did not agree with those plans, so we went to the aquarium instead. (My record of never having gone to a water park remains unscathed.)

This is only the second aquarium I've ever been to, first one was [in Houston](/2019/06/us-2019-vegas-houston/). This one was much better, it had a lot more stuff and interesting displays. The ten-year-old's review: "10/10 would visit again!"
