Had no internet at home from around 11am yesterday and it was restored today at around 1pm. Kudos to Globe actually for getting someone out here the day after I reported the problem to their CS messenger bot. (And to the crew for not making me wait all afternoon)

<!--sep-->The problem was some loose connection outside our house. Their comms could be improved though. The SMS I got yesterday just said someone will "reach out to me", I had to call this morning to confirm we're getting a site visit.

<!--sep-->Losing internet for 24h felt forever though. A sign of our modern era.
