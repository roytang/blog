<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/0/8/8/2/530882-john-wick-chapter-4-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bc32219057" /></p> <p>My friends asked me how this movie was and I was like "It meets expectations. You kind of imagine what a new John Wick movie would be like, and this is exactly that." Great action sequences as usual. One of the characters I had no idea why he was in the script at all, didn't seem like he added anything of interest.</p><p>While I did enjoy the film, I do think the whole John Wick saga went on a bit too long, and each additional entry, while entertaining, will just never have as much bang as the previous entries, so I'm glad this film concluded the way it did.</p>
