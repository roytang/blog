<p>What happens to old sites? They decay. Their maintainers lose interest or forget about them. Their software eventually falls out of date. They break. Eventually, they stop paying the server and domain bills, and the site goes dark. The Wayback Machine saves some, but not all, never the moving parts of a site, and often incompletely.</p><p>Realize now, this will happen to every site you use and love today. The internet is not kind to old tech and information, even when it's still perfectly good. Old memes, old communities, old shows, bands, games, their days are all numbered. Entropy rules all.</p><p>If you find a site that dates to 2005 or earlier but is still on the web, that _matters_. Simple longevity on the net is a noteworthy feat.</p>
