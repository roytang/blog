I hadn't seen a lot of Makoto Shinkai before. I've seen 5cms/second and know a bit about Your name by reputation, so I was expecting something similar to either of those, which I am willing to sit through, but not really the sort of thing I'm super into.</p><p>My expectations were broken. I ended up greatly enjoying this film. It had a lot more action than I expected, the animation was fantastic, and the script and plot were very clever and had the sort of timey-wimey shenanigans I always enjoy. </p><p>Lol that chair!</p>
