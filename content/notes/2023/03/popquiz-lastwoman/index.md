Last night we attended the first PopQuiz for the year. And CRUSHED IT!

Rounds were:

1. TV and Streaming - 9pts (x2 for successful ace)
2. Personalities - 6pts
3. Video and Board Games - 2pts (lol)
4. Movies - 7pts (x2 for powerup)
5. Literature - 3pts
6. Music - 6pts

They had a new "Hail Mary" mechanic, where you could replace your lowest scoring round with your score from an extra enumeration question (noted as "HM5" - 5 pts in the attached image), but only if your team ordered a certain amount of food and drinks from the resto. Boo, pay to win! (We won without using it!)
