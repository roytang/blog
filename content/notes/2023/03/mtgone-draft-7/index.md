Did another off-stream draft last night, a premier one this time, spending gold to try to restock my gem balance after the disastrous Arena Open Weekend. It went well, the draft went to 6, so profit~ I actually learned a lot from the quick drafts I think, I wouldn't have been sure how to draft this kind of RG deck before. Was tempted to do a second one but (a) didn't have time; and (b) let's not push our luck (or our gem total!)
