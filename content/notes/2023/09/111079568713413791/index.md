<p>Had enough gems for 2 tries at this weekend&#39;s Arena Open, but unfortunately we did not do well =/ First run went 5-3 and 2nd run went 3-3. Second run was obviously a waste of gems, but first run felt good and the deck was sweet but we got two losses from Gruff Triplets and the third loss because I was a bit too aggressive. Better luck next time!</p><p><a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/mtg" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mtg</span></a> <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/mtgwoe" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mtgwoe</span></a> <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/magicarena" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>magicarena</span></a></p>
