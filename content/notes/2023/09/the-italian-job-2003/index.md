<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/9/4/7/46947-the-italian-job-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=eff66e8c8e" /></p> <p>For some reason I came into this thinking it was about stealing cars? Some good driving scenes though. An entertaining heist movie; I love the ones that have elaborate heist plans that have to be adjusted at the last minute. Having Charlie and Stella end up together seemed unnecessary though.</p>
