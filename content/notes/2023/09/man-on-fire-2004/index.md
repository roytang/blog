<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/vy/z4/mq/qc/qAbRLPe8T7ehKzr1Tgo78T7ASrS-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7b09147ed3" /></p> <p>The director loves doing these exposition/atmospheric scenes with a lot of strobing lights and it's super annoying. The film is very dark and intense, but Denzel's character is very methodical and specific in his vengeance, never doing it out of sadism, just enough to extract the information he needs. I mostly watched this because I heard Denzel and Dakota are reuniting 20 years later in Equalizer 3 lol</p>
