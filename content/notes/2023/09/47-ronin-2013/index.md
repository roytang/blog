<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/7q/cu/fc/rt/4D5LM8BRdWuBQXSjLh1iAddchdM-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=fd1bd4de94" /></p> <p>I was so distracted at the start of the film because one of the characters is named "Oishi", which means "delicious"?!? I guess it's a different pronunciation but still.</p><p>Found out later it was based on an actual Japanese historical story and that makes inserting a white guy into the story and making them all speak English even more of a travesty lol.</p><p>That being said, I did enjoy the fight scenes and the final raid at the end.</p>
