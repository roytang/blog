<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://dosgame.club/@jefklak" class="u-url mention">@<span>jefklak</span></a></span> you mean by using the keyboard arrow keys, yeah? The prev/next nav doesn&#39;t have that kind of keyboard support, even with the previous implementation, since it currently doesn&#39;t use any JS. You can still tab to the buttons and Enter, but I understand that&#39;s clunky.</p><p>I was thinking of adding some progressive JS enhancement to support swipe left/right nav, so I could add the left/right arrow key support as well, but I&#39;m not sure when I&#39;ll get around to that.</p><p>Thanks for the feedback!</p>
