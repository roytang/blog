<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/8/1/3/46813-the-fast-and-the-furious-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=ec37dbaf43" /></p> <p>Never seen any of this series, but the first four are up on NF, so I figured why not? I am not big on cars or racing so the plot did not particularly appeal to me, but some of the racing/chase scenes were intense. You could easily sense Paul Walker actually being a cop from the very beginning (mostly because his insistence on getting into Dom's good graces and not caring about what happens to his car makes no sense).</p>
