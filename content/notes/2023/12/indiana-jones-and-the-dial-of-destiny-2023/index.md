<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/5/4/3/3/265433-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=34f4a02c6b" /></p> <p>This was a fun ride, but I feel like too much of the movie is dedicated to the whole "fighting Nazis" side of Indy and could have used a bit more tomb-raiding and puzzle-solving.</p><p>Fleabag's character was ok, though I wish she and the kid got a bit more of a conclusion at the end of it all. Also, I found hilarious the canon explanation as to why Shia Lebouf is not in this film lol.</p><p>That bit towards the end makes this one of the more fantastical Indy films, but not as much as Crystal Skull!</p>
