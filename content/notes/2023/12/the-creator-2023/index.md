<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/5/0/2/9/595029-the-creator-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=b921bf1d45" /></p> <p>Visually stunning and some excellent set pieces in there and I liked the portrayal of near-future Asia being oppressed by the US military because honestly that doesn't seem too implausible. The sci-fi plot is more of an allegory for discrimination/acceptance than for our current "AI" landscape. Washington was fine, but that kid's performance was superb.</p>
