<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/8/9/0/6/658906-they-cloned-tyrone-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=afe533ab4e" /></p> <p>This felt like a cross between "Blaxploitation" films and conspiracy comedies like Hot Fuzz. The former is not really my jam, but I liked the latter part of it. Kind of weird and the conspiracy involved felt over-the-top-ridiculous. Great performances by John Boyega (first time seeing him outside of Star Wars), Teyonnah Parris (first time seeing her outside of MCU) and Jamie Foxx.</p>
