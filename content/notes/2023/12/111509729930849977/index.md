<p>This year I had shifted most of my music listening to Youtube and also i hooked up my spotify account to our family&#39;s Amazon Echo which my mom basically uses as a radio. As a result my <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/SpotifyWrapped" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>SpotifyWrapped</span></a> this year is almost entirely OPM oldies. Will look into a separate account for the Echo lol</p>
