We attended the first game of the new Geekfight league at Moon Rabbit. The theme was "myths and magic" and it was a very challenging low-scoring game.

1. Weapons and Artifacts - 3pts (x2 for joker)
2. Spellcraft - 3pts
3. Creatures and Constructs - 2pts
4. Stage Magicians - 2pts
5. Pantheons - 5pts
6. Wielders of Magic - 5pts

We counted 23pts total for us, but they had us at 25pts. There were a couple of questions where I thought they didn't count our answer because it wasn't exactly what was asked, but I guess they counted it?

We ended up tied for 2nd place and I think the winning team was only around 4pts away, so if we had chosen a better joker we would have tied maybe! Still, that was a much better outcome than I thought we'd get! 

Second place is good enough for 2 league points. The next league game is about Taylor Swift, so I'm not attending that one!
