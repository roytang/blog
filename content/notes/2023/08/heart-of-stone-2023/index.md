Gal Gadot is so good! </p><p>(I think she meant the character is hypercompetent.)</p><p>The film obviously goes for the Mission Impossible vibe with the action sequences and set pieces, though the story here is a bit like the opposite of Dead Reckoning. The plot here was a bit rough around the edges but the action was good and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. And honestly, I think Gal Gadot's acting is starting to get a bit better.</p>
