<p>Renewed my driver&#39;s license today. Last time I did this (6 years ago) it took me about an hour and cost around P1000. Today it took around 2.5hrs (they said they were having network issues) and cost P1245.</p><p>I have the misfortune of needing to renew my license at times that they don&#39;t have license cards to give, so I have once again paid for a receipt and a promise.</p>
