<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/1/1/6/51116-street-kings-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7ac0bc21e1" /></p> <p>Watched this one just because it was in the NF top 10. Action and suspense were fine, but it's hard to be supportive or sympathetic towards the protags when everyone is a dirty cop. Mastermind was kind of obvious early on.
