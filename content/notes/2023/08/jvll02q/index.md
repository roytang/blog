I think they should introduce a new paper-accurate format that is "all the paper cards in arena", including the fetches and cards like counterspell and lightning bolt. It would be wild. 

Also, it would have the added benefit of cutting off all the whining about "Alchemy in Historic" (people would just find something new to whine about, but at least it would be new!)
