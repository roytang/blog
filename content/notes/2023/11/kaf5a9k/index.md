**Has anyone here tried applying for PCSO financial assistance via their NCR Online Application page?**

We were referred to this program to get additional financial support for some medical concerns, but IDK if the site is working properly, the URL is:

https://www.pcso.gov.ph/webapps/NCROnlineApplication.aspx

If I try to "Proceed Online Application" after midnight and before 8am, it just returns a message that says the website is only open Monday to Friday, 8am to 3pm.

If I try it any time from 8am onwards, it just shows a message "Please be informed that a daily budget cut-off is set for online applications. In case your request does not get through today, we encourage you to try again next day."

Not sure if I'm doing something wrong or the website really isn't working. Baka lang may naka try na or naka encounter na nito or may otherwise nakakaalam or makakatulong. Thanks!
