  "text": "If you are from within NCR, you will be asked to go to your nearest PCSO office and request financial support. My suggestion is to do your research (Google/YouTube) about the steps/requirements. Marami lagi pila dun and better if dala mo na lahat ng requirements para hindi pabalik-balik.  \n\n\nIf you're not from within NCR, then you can file via online, however, sobrang bilis ng cut-off dahil marami kang kasabay na online nagfa-file. Tyambahan lang makapasok. Minsan 8AM palang cut-off na.  \n\n\nIn a way much better ang walk-in kasi minsan may irerequest pa sainyo based on your case.",
