Final quiz night for the year!

Rounds were:

1. Westerns - 5pts
2. TV series final seasons - 5pts (x2 for poor choice of powerup)*
3. Videogame sounds - 3pts (this was so tough!)
4. Post-apocalyptic movies - 7pts (x2 for successful Ace)
5. New Year's Eve in media - 6pts
6. Death, Orgasm or Faking It - 4pts
7. (Hail Mary) actors who have portrayed Andres Bonifacio - 1pt

We had a couple of bad rounds (the TV one was harder than we expected!). The "Hail Mary" mechanic returned and we were eligible, but it was useless for us as we scored even worse. Winning team was 10pts ahead, so even if we got a perfect score on the HM round it would not have mattered!
