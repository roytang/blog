title: "Popquiz: Marvels"
---

We played a Marvels-themed PopQuiz with only 4 players and 5 teams. 

1. Powers and Abilities in the Marvel Universe - 8pts (x2 for power up)
2. Objects and Things in the Marvel Universe - 8pts
3. Good Guys of the Marvel Universe - 7pts
4. Locations and Events in the Marvel Universe - 8pts
5. Villains of the Marvel universe - 8pts
6. The "Marvels" - 8pts
   
I came into this one super confident that I could basically solo it and got annoyed that I missed the very first question due to a brain fart. I ended up needing crucial help as well from one of my teammates (luckily I brought backup!) as the game ended up unexpectedly close and we only won by 2 pts. But as a pleasant surprise, the first place prize included tickets to a free screening of the Marvels the next day!
