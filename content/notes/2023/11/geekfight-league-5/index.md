This was game 5 of the current Geekfight League, themed as "anime/manga". We pulled in one of our friends who watches more anime than us, but we still did poorly.

1. Video Games - 5pts
2. Seinen and Josei - 3pts
3. Studios and Publishers - 4pts
4. Adaptations - 2pts
5. Shōnen and Shōjo - 4pts (x2 for Joker)
6. OPs and EDs - 3pts

We retained our league lead, but are now within striking distance of one of the other teams. The next league game is themed "Sariling Atin" on the 22nd.
