We played a Friendsgiving-themed PopQuiz.

1. BFFs in TV - 8pts (x2 for Ace)
2. Buddies and #Squads in Movies - 5pts
3. FRIENDS (TV show) - 8pts (x2 for Power Up)
4. Thanksgiving in Pop Culture - 5pts
5. Video and Board Games - 7pts
6. Friendship Songs - 10pts
   
One of my teammates was a big FRIENDS fan so we used our Power-Up there. The Ace also worked out for us. We didn't qualify for the extra Hail Mary bonus round, but we didn't end up needing it - we won the game comfortably! I was even able to answer a football question!
