I don't really care about Twitter cutting off free SMS 2FA (more secure options are still available), but it's weird that current users of the feature need to remove it themselves or lose access to their accounts.<!--sep--> Apparently $44B tech companies are unable to automatically turn off a feature they are planning to take away!
