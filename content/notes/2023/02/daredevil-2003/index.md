Trying to do Elektra, Kingpin and Bullseye all in one go was maybe a bit too ambitious. It led to them cutting back on actually developing each character properly. No mention of Stick or the Hand anywhere, we are just supposed to believe that Matt gained his fighting skills just by training a lot as by himself a kid. And Matt is super cavalier with not hiding his extra senses! He randomly tries to pick up Elektra at a coffee shop because she smells good, no backstory there. Also, in his first action sequence as Daredevil, he flat out murders a perp! WTH</p><p>I did enjoy a few of the action sequences, especially with Colin Farell's over-the-top Bullseye. Ellen Pompeo makes a short appearance as Karen Page! The soundtrack is pretty good too.</p>
