I have temporarily blocked that user agent and it seems to have stabilized my server load.</p><p>It&#39;s a bit weird because I checked and my domain is still on [the filtered list](<a href=\"https://lieu.cblgh.org/filtered\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"invisible\">https://</span><span class=\"\">lieu.cblgh.org/filtered</span><span class=\"invisible\"></span></a>). As an example, the attached image shows a 24-hour access log from like 10 days ago; 294k requests from Lieu out of 341k total!</p>",
