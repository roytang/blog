I understand space cloud Galactus was kind of silly, but I would imagine a gigantic guy in a hat would not have played well in theaters in 2007. </p><p>Was nice to see Chris Evans being brash and annoying instead of the do-gooder Steve Rogers. Also, there is way more physical comedy with Reed's abilities than I thought there would be. Also I thought the surfer's voice acting was pretty good.</p>
