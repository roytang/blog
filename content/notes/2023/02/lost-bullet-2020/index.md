Didn't know anything coming in other than it's some kind of Fast and the Furious-type thing, and I've never seen any of those films. Surprised to find out it's actually a French film. Switched to French voices with English subs because the English dubs in live action really throws me off. </p><p>The plot isn't that original and kinda predictable and there were actually not as many car chases than I thought there would be, but it's a decent 90-minute popcorn film</p>
