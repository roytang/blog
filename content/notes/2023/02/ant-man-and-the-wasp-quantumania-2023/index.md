Watched this yesterday. Spoiler-free review:

I enjoyed the film, but that might be because I'm a comics fan anyway and I don't care too much about CGI detail (a lot of people seem hung up on that). I liked the humor and the references, I liked the bad guy's costume design, was pleasantly surprised by some actors' being there and was honestly a bit giddy when a certain acronym was first mentioned.

That being said, I can understand all the complaints about the film. Character development is definitely not great and some of the returning cast don't have a lot to do. The ending is kind of a big missed opportunity and the first post-credits scene felt really silly. (Second post-credits scene will mean nothing to anyone who hasn't seen a particular TV series!) My brother (who I watched with) complained that the bad guy's background / origin story should have been more fleshed out. Apparently the writer for this film once wrote for Rick and Morty and that influence is certainly felt, which a lot of people might not enjoy.

I watched in IMAX and it was fine, though probably not necessary. Though I did enjoy seeing the Guardians 3 trailer in IMAX.

The plot felt very Star Wars. In fact, there's a specific scene in the third act that reminds me of a specific scene in the third act of Rise of Skywalker.

-0.5 stars for not having Luis, even as a cameo. My favorite performance here is by Michael Douglas, whose Hank Pym seems to be having the least stressful time in all 3 movies.
