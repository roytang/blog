<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/7/6/3/1/497631-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=365d59f809" /></p> <p>A fantastic follow-up to the original 2018 movie, further developing Miles and expanding on Gwen's back story as well. Fantastic use of animation not only to portray the different universes, but as also as a storytelling tool to convey emotion, tone and depth. Also I must commend the marketing for preparing trailers that while they showed a lot of the fun stuff in the films, never spoiled any of the deeper plot moments or the cause of the ultimate conflict that arises between Miles and the other Spiders. Looking forward to Beyond the Spider-verse next year!</p>
