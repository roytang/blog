Maybe minor spoilers here.</p><p>First off the controversial lead, but I won't speak towards anything outside the film. Their performance was decent, especially considering most of the time they were their own scene partner.</p><p>The Flash suit looks so weird and bulky especially when uncharged. I liked his plated suit from JL a lot more.</p><p>Keaton's older Bruce Wayne is the highlight of this film though. A manic and delightfully reckless performance. Sasha Calle does well as the very angry Supergirl, though her arc isn't very long and always ends in tragedy.</p><p>Not a fan of retrocausality in my time travel, but I am amazed at how they timed the whole spaghetti explanation to just after I complained about it. Also, the audacity to both cite and modify BTTF, drawing into that film's casting history, as the prime example of consequences. This was excellent.</p><p>A lot of people mentioned how the CGI was weird, but most of the weird CGI was stuff happening in Flash-time or in the time bubble, and I felt like that was fine, stylistically as a choice?</p><p>The initial Flash-time sequence at the Gotham hospital would have been amazing had the X-Men movies not already done TWO similar sequences with Quicksilver many years ago (and with better backing music to boot!) </p><p>There is very little in common with the actual Flashpoint comics storyline but I do appreciate the little that was there. That they tried to recreate the Flash accident the same way was great.</p><p>It's a superhero film so the final act was mostly a big battle sequence, but this one never got a satisfying ending because of how the plot had to go. </p><p>I thought the CGI cameos were fine and not disrespectful or anything (assuming they cleared it with the estates etc). It's not like Star Wars hasn't done similar before.</p><p>I laughed heartily at the final cameo after Barry leaves the courthouse.</p><p>Iris West felt like such a non-character.</p><p>My brother said it felt like they were going for something closer to the MCU level of humor here.</p><p>That post-credits scene felt useless.</p><p>Overall I think the movie was fine, though it was very much a superhero movie. Not sure it deserved to flop, though I guess that means Miller is unlikely to come back as Barry Allen.</p><p>It doesn't really feel like it "ended" the current DCEU incarnation. I was kind of expecting some kind of crisis event at the end that told us their multiverse was being rewritten or something. Might have been too much to ask for a "mainstream" movie. Well, we'll see what James Gunn brings us.</p>
