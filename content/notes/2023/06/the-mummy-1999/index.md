<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/5i/du/2g/s8/6CweTLmngcPrsEH4G6RKvdwmQdC-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=397ac4a555" /></p> <p>When I told my friends I'd never seen this film before they told me it's fun so I watched it. It was indeed fun, but not as fun as I'd hoped and I feel like my expectations were set too high. I think I was expecting more Indiana Jones type hijinx and instead got body horror and cheesy 90s CGI.</p><p>That being said, still very entertaining; Fraser and Weiss gave good performances that prevented the movie from being too cheesy. I like how the protag starts out rough and a bit belligerent but comes around to show he really cares about the girl. </p><p>I was thinking about also watching the Tom Cruise remake, but I read that Fraser said it was "less fun" than the original so maybe not.</p>
