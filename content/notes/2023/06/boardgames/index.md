Met up with some friends for boardgames TWICE this week! One of our playgroup is flying back to the US next week so we won't be able to play together in person for a while so we took the opportunity to play as much as we can.

Earlier in the week, we finally managed to finish the Path to Carcosa campaign of Arkham Horror card game. We just barely made it out scenario 7 alive, but scenario 8 was a bit easier. Overall the game is fun and interesting and challenging, but you really need a regular playgroup to go through a campaign. I think the game was designed to be played one scenario per day with your group meeting regularly once or twice a week, instead of our two-scenarios-per-day over four meetings.

Saturday we got to try out the Conan board game. I didn't get to take a picture of the box, but I believe this was [Conan The Conqueror](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/302261/conan-conqueror) board game. We had time for 3 scenarios, and I chose to play the Overlord all 3 times, but I lost twice and won once, probably because I was a bit too aggro. It was good fun and the scenarios took much less than time I expected given how complicated the initial explanations of turns and actions were. However, I think Conan himself is a bit too OP! (When I complained about it, my friends simply pointed out the game is named after him!) Also, I really like that big snake figurine.

After we got tired of Conan, we played a bit more of Scout and Maskman ([we last played them more than a month ago](/2023/05/gameday/)!), and we found out we had actually been playing Scout wrong last time and the actual rules were much more challenging. (I did so poorly)!
