#MTGArenaStats email for #MTGMOM dropped. 

[Last time](/2023/04/1651196904439689218/) I said I'd compile these into a table, but apparently I haven't yet so here it is now: [General Arena Stats](/page/stats/mtg/#general-arena-stats). Having the stats table tells me MOM was a low-yield set for me; fairly lower games played and gold earned. Probably because I was [drafting so poorly in this set](/2023/06/mtgmom-limited-recap/). Or maybe I've just been playing less because I was busy with other things.
