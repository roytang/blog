<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/pq/9f/sr/vt/aCIFMriQh8rvhxpN1IWGgvH0Tlg-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=f3165fe17f" /></p> <p>Enjoyed this one but it was a bit hard on the brain especially around the middle. Pretty good action and the plot mindbending to say the least. It wasn't that bad if you don't spend too much time trying to plot out all the timelines and puzzle over the loopholes but I suspect that plot was still way too complicated for the mass market audience and that Nolan lucked out with the pandemic happening as it did to lower box office expectations.</p>
