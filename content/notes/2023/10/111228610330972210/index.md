<p>Occasionally I&#39;ll spot some spammy urls accessed on my server with chinese text and URLs related to buying backlinks. (Sample shown in screenshot - no alt-text because I don&#39;t want to type out those spammy URLs) This is not a valid tag on my website.</p><p>Why do they do this? What benefit does it get them? That text they send doesn&#39;t appear on my website in any shape or form, and accessing these urls doesn&#39;t change that! There are 200+ such hits on my access log for the current day!</p>
