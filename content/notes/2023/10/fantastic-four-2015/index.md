<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/3/0/6/5/123065-fantastic-four-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=1399b230e4" /></p> <p>Way too serious and missing the heart that made the 2005 film work well enough to get a sequel. I do like the cast and the fact that the military industrial complex tries to take advantage of the kids with these powers, feels very realistic. Given that, the ending/epilogue came out of nowhere and made no sense given the rest of the movie; I guess it was part of the reported reshoots?</p><p>Also yet another attempt to have Doom be a metal-skinned weirdo with unexplained powers. Just once I'd like to have him just be a horribly scarred and smart yet narcissistic tyrant who despises Reed for showing him up!</p><p>It did make me dig out my copy of Ultimate Fantastic Four vol 1 for a re-read though.</p>
