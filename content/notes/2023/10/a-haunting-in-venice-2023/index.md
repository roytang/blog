I haven't read the book it was based on, although I read that it was a loose adaptation. Good use of camera work to portray the more "supernatural" elements of the case. Decent performances, though I often have trouble taking Tina Fey seriously. </p><p>I kind of suspected the final culprit but couldn't explain why, though in hindsight the case might have been solveable, had one been paying attention. (I have never solved any of these Christie stories ahead of time, I just like to imagine that I could have!)</p>
