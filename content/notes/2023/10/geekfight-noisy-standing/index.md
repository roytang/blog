This was game 3 of the current Geekfight League, themed as "back to school".

(The trivia team sent representatives to game 2 which was Taylor Swift themed, but I did not attend as I had nothing to contribute. The team won that one though!)

1. Geography - 3pts (not unexpected)
2. Languages - 6pts
3. Math - 7pts (x2 for joker)
4. MAPEH - 4pts
5. Science - 5pts
6. History - 2pts (also unsurprising!)

I was worried we wouldn't make it, but it turned out to be another low-scoring game and we tied for first! That means we retain our position as league leader!
