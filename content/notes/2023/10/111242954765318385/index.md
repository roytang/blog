<p>Wilds of Eldraine quick drafts came back to Arena last week, so I decided to do a couple of them to end the season.</p><p>Since there was a season reset I was at silver and winning is a lot easier at the lower ranks. First QD (WB) went 7-1 while the second QD (BGr) went 7-2.</p><p>Overall I think this puts WOE as my winningest limited format on Arena to date! It&#39;s a good place to stop and start saving up for the next set!</p><p><a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/mtg" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mtg</span></a> <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/mtgwoe" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mtgwoe</span></a> <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/magicarena" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>magicarena</span></a></p>
