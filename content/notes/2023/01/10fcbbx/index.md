#### Posted on r/MarvelUnlimited: [Does is anyone know why Captain America #400 is incomplete on MU?](https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelUnlimited/comments/10fcbbx/does_is_anyone_know_why_captain_america_400_is/)

It only has the main story from operation galatic storm. Looks like there should also be backups with falcon and usagent rescuing dman and diamondback/crossbones origin story
