<p>I was kind of intrigued by the idea of a &quot;text-focused tiktok&quot;, but given that their homepage requires a phone number to get on the waitlist tells me they are prioritizing phone/app-based users. No web access (or web users as second class citizens) is a nonstarter for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/31/23579552/artifact-instagram-cofounders-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-news-app" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">theverge.com/2023/1/31/2357955</span><span class="invisible">2/artifact-instagram-cofounders-kevin-systrom-mike-krieger-news-app</span></a></p>
