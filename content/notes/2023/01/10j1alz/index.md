#### Posted on r/fireTV: [Why is the Prime Video app on Fire Stick so bad?](https://www.reddit.com/r/fireTV/comments/10j1alz/why_is_the_prime_video_app_on_fire_stick_so_bad/)

I set up a Fire Stick on my Mom's non-smart TV so she can watch Netflix, YouTube and Prime Video, and the PV app is without question the worst of these.

The two main problems:

- it always logs in as the main profile (mine) instead of the subprofile I made for my mom. I would prefer having a profile selection screen whenever you open the app (the app for LG WebOS does this)

- the Options menu (available while playing via the hamburger button the remote) doesn't highlight where you are currently on the menu. Whenever I want to change the audio or subtitle settings, I need to guess where I am on the menu and hope I hit the correct one instead of "Go back to beginning" which happens way too often. My mom and dad don't understand how I'm able to navigate this menu at all and I can't really explain it to them

Any suggestions for working around the above problems? Or is there some setting I've missed that can fix these?
