<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/6/2/1/51621-good-will-hunting-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=acb4766abd" /></p> <p>I haven't seen this before, but that scene where Will is at a bar taking down some guy talking about economics? I've seen it on the internet so many times, I figured I should go watch the film already.</p><p>This film came out in 1997 when I was in maybe the 2nd year of college and I feel like back then I would not have appreciated the themes of talent, ambition, fear and regret that encompass Will's journey in this film.</p><p>I can see why it's regarded as a modern-day classic. The film alternates between light-hearted moments and gut-wrenching conflict. The script is excellent (Best Original Screenplay Oscar was well-deserved!) and Williams and Damon gave really good performances. I am not sure if Damon or Affleck have ever been in films this good since then.</p><p>Disappointed at no title drop. I wanted Sean to say at some point "That's good, Will Hunting."</p>
