Hung out with some friends today for card games and fighting games.

We played two card games, Maskmen and Scout from OINKGames.

They are both trick-taking card games (think *Pusoy dos*) with twists:

- Maskmen (flavored around Lucha Libre Wrestling): The order of cards (i.e. which cards can beat the others) are determined dynamically during the course of a game
- Scout (flavored around recruiting carnival people?): Each card consists of two numbers, one on each half of the card. The order of your hand is set (you cannot shuffle your hand!). Before the round begins, you must choose which half to use for each card. You can only play cards in straights or sets of the same number, and they may only be played together if they were adjacent in your hand. 

I liked Scout better than Maskmen; the mechanics made each hand a more complicated puzzle to think about ahead of time, whereas in Maskmen you pretty much tried to adjust on the fly.

Our group being who we are, we also brought along an aging PS4 to play some fighting games, namely Street Fighter V and Granblue Fantasy Versus. One would think I would beat them up in SFV since I played it a lot, but I'm rusty and we always play random chars, and I had to use a controller (I prefer arcade stick), so it was pretty competitive. GFV was nice, but the roster was a bit too small for my tastes.
