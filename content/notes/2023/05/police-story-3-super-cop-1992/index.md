<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/5/7/2/45572-police-story-3-super-cop-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3c5469ed8d" /></p> <p>Watched this only because I heard young Michelle Yeoh was in it, then realized afterwards that I've never actually seen Police Story 2.</p><p>It was fine, lots of good fighting and stunts as would be expected. Michelle Yeoh looks so different especially during the earlier scenes; I think if I had seen this blind it might have taken me a while to recognize her. She did great though.</p><p>I think I like the original Police Story a bit more; like the bus sequences in the third act of the first film were a bit more interesting than the train sequences here. Though it is nice that Jacky has someone else on his side who can do kung fu.</p>
