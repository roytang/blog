<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/9/7/1/1/379711-guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bd023e472c" /></p> <p>Feels like this had a darker, more somber and much more emotional tone than the first two films. A very hateable villain, especially for animal lovers. The Guardians crew are at the best they've ever been; the banter and the coordination fighting alongside each other are a testament of how they've grown together as a found family. The films gives a fitting end to the story arcs for most of our Guardians crew.</p><p>Some plot nitpicks here and there, and my brother though the film was just a tad too long, but nothing too problematic. James Gunn has more or less stuck the landing on his final MCU film.</p>
