We attended a Star Wars-themed PopQuiz at Shantung restaurant. We did much better than I expected despite having only 3 people who actually knew Star Wars stuff

Rounds were:

1. Prequel trilogy - 6pts
2. Animated TV - 7pts
3. Original trilogy - 7pts (x2 for powerup)
4. Live Action TV - 7pts
5. Sequel Trilogy - 6pts
6. Star Wars References in other media - 5pts

The "Hail Mary" mechanic returned; this time we were eligible, but we also knew nothing about the question so we opted not to answer and just live with our lowest round score of 5pts. Still not a fan of this mechanic.

We finished 3rd somehow!
