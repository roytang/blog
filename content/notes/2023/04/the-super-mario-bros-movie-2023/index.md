<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/2/3/0/2/432302-the-super-mario-bros-movie-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=fea7ccddda" /></p> <p>Pretty good as far as video game adaptations go. The plot of the film is definitely for kids, but that can't be avoided as the source material isn't exactly deep. A fun romp with lots of references for fans of the Mario franchise in general. Huge improvement over the last film!</p><p>+ performances by Jack Black and Seth Rogen who were obviously having fun<br />+ Charles Martinet (original Mario voice) playing Mario's dad!!<br />+ Peach kicking ass<br />+ the existential Luma lol<br />- not explaining if their last name is Mario</p>
