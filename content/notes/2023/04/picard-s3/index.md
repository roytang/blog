This is the final season for Star Trek: Picard and hopefully the last great adventure for Admiral Jean-Luc Picard, we all know he has earned a rest!

I liked this season, probably more than seasons 1 or 2, mainly because I was a big fan of TNG - I watched a bit of it back in the 90s but was only able to binge all of it around 2015 I think. This season reunites Admiral Picard with his old crew as they discover a *Secret Invasion*-style conspiracy within Starfleet that leads them to face off against one of Picard's greatest Nemesis.

It was great seeing the old Enterprise crew somehow back together, old and gray-haired. Worf remains my favorite Enterprise crew member, even though he has softened a bit with age.
