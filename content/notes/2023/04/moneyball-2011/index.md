I realized later that she was referring to this film and decided to finally watch it.</p><p>It's pretty good! It's a film about sports, but not really a sports film. And also a film about trying out new things and challenging industry preconceptions. The pacing and shots and how the pivotal moments in the team's season are portrayed are all well-executed.</p><p>Definitely the sort of film for my mom though.</p>
