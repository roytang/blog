<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/4/9/9/6/564996-murder-mystery-2-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=08117aff8f" /></p> <p>Needed a light film to watch in the background, settled on this one from NF recommendations. I have almost no memory of what happened in the first film.</p><p>Sandler and Aniston's characters are now bumbling amateur detectives who rapidly stumble into happening to solve a kidnapping (and several murders). The humor is about what you'd expect for this kind of movie.</p><p>It reminds me of Rush Hour 3 for some reason, but that might just be because they also went to Paris (and that is the only detail I remember from Rush Hour 3)</p><p>Film is entertaining enough as popcorn fare that you shouldn't think too much about.</p>
