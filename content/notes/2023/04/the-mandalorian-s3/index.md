This was an okay season with some interesting cameos. The ending brought Bo-Katan and Moff Gideon's story full circle and to a good conclusion and ending with Din Djarin and Grogu in a good spot for future adventures.

I like how the subtitles still refer to Din Djarin as "the Mandalorian" even when there are like fifty other Mandalorians in the same scene.

I'm not sure how much Pedro Pascal is earning his keep here. We never once see his face the entire season, so I'm wondering if he only gets VA rates?
