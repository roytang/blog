One option is to just seed it as a torrent and let other archivists worry about putting a readable/searchable copy online somewhere (I am also interested in seeing a dump)

Isn't the forum text-based only? i.e. they don't host images? If it's just text the data dump can't be that large; if may images yeah, it might be a problem.

Looking forward to an update soon!
