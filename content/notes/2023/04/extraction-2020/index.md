<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/4/4/7/1/474471-extraction-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=4b684f8e41" /></p> <p>Wanted an action film to watch while doing other stuff, this was a pretty good choice. Was honestly a bit bored at the start but then they had this insanely long set of action sequences that look like they were all a single shot (I found out later that they weren't, but still pretty impressive) and I started paying attention.</p><p>The plot isn't much to speak about, but the action sequences are pretty good and Hemsworth gives a pretty decent performance actually. Not bad, will probably give the sequel a shot.</p>
