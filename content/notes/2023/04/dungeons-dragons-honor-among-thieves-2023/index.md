<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/4/0/0/3/424003-dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7c3c4fddf9" /></p> <p>This was so good. Fresh, fun and witty adventure, and so many references for those familiar with the source material. I liked the Paladin and the Druid, but all the characters are quite good and reasonably fleshed out and likeable and the performances are pretty good. This is what I wish MCU movies could be like since Endgame.</p>
