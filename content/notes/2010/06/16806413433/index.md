title: Playing RDW on MTGO
---

the best thing about RDW has to be the ability to win with one land for the entire game #mtg

<time>[07:38]</time> My opponent cast All is Dust to kill a Goblin Guide. :D #mtg EOT I burn for 7, then untap and burn for 4 more.

<time>[2010-06-28 21:23] </time> "Kor Firewalker: Giving people with no skill the ability to beat red since 2009." - from a forum post on MTGSalvation

<time>[2010-06-28 22:29] </time> I find that a lot of losses come from keeping questionable hands and hoping to draw a particular set of cards. #mtg

<time>[2010-06-28 23:38] </time> It's sometimes annoying how RDW lives or dies with T1 Goblin Guide. But not as annoying as KFR #mtg #rdw

<time>[2010-06-29 18:25] </time> Some of my RDW stats: Over 55 tournament matches, won 75% of game ones, but only 61% of matches overall. #mtg I blame Kor Firewalker.

<time>[2010-06-29 18:28] </time> Now playing: 5th Jund matchup in a row. #mtg

<time>[2010-06-29 18:38] </time> Mull to 5 vs Jund, then revealing Blightning off the T1 Goblin Guide = NOT COOL

<time>[2010-07-10 08:15] </time> RDW mirror is ridiculous when both have D-Claws out
