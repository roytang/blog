Pyretic Ritual - first Timetwister, now Dark Ritual? #mtg #m11

[13:57] I hope [@fivewithflores](https://twitter.com/fivewithflores/) has something good for us tomorrow. Other than the Lich, the previews this week have been a bit meh. #mtg #m11

[16:28] I hope a pull a Juggernaut at the prerelease and fight today's preview card. I get to say "I'm the Juggernaut, Lich!" #mtg #m11
