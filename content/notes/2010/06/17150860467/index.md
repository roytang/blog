Someday, someone will take out 4 O-Rings and 4 Spreading Seas with a single Back to Nature. It's going to be legendary! #mtg #m11

<time>[18:10]</time> Goblin Balloon Brigade was reprinted so red decks could have a Goblin that could fly over Wall of Omens. #mtg #m11

<time>[18:22]</time> Amused at the thread on salvation about the possibility of Goblin Piledriver being reprinted. It always reminds me of wrestling. #mtg #m11

<time>[18:30]</time> I hope Eternal Witness gets reprinted now that she's out of extended. There's still space for her in the number crunch! #mtg #m11
