Boo SGC is out. #mtg #m11

<time>[12:11]</time> #mtg #m11 [@mtgaaron](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/) just confirmed Elvish Archdruid reprinted, that should debunk the silly Imperious Perfect rumor?

<time>[12:11]</time> I think Grave Titan is easily the strongest of this cycle. #mtg #m11

<time>[12:15]</time> Interestingly, Green Titan gets any lands, not just basics. #mtg #m11

<time>[13:37]</time> Today's previews weren't as exciting as I had hoped. Though Grave Titan is solid, we already knew about this cycle. #mtg #m11

<time>[13:42]</time> Gaea's Revenge needed trample. Or "Protection from nongreen" #mtg #m11

<time>[13:45]</time> Hm... [@maro254](https://twitter.com/maro254/) 's article mentioned "rare and mythic rare cycle that you'll be learning about pretty soon", what are they? #mtg #m11

<time>[23:54]</time> Aw man, the number crunch already rules out Char in #m11. I need a replacement for Staggershock, it's kinda bad unless opp's at 4. #mtg #rdw

<time>[12:19]</time> Turn 5/6 Primeval Titan fetching 2 Eldrazi temple. Untap, swing, 2 more Temples, land drop, Emrakul. #mtg

<time>[23:56]</time> I wonder if Wizards will someday have a set with randomly assigned card numbers. Just to screw with number crunchers. #mtg

<time>[12:26]</time> I would love me some of those Japanese alt. art Jace/Chandras. Probably gonna be hella expensive though. #mtg
