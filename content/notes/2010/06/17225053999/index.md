Boo SGC is out. #mtg #m11

[12:11] #mtg #m11 [@mtgaaron](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/) just confirmed Elvish Archdruid reprinted, that should debunk the silly Imperious Perfect rumor?

[12:11] I think Grave Titan is easily the strongest of this cycle. #mtg #m11

[12:15] Interestingly, Green Titan gets any lands, not just basics. #mtg #m11

[13:37] Today's previews weren't as exciting as I had hoped. Though Grave Titan is solid, we already knew about this cycle. #mtg #m11

[13:42] Gaea's Revenge needed trample. Or "Protection from nongreen" #mtg #m11

[13:45] Hm... [@maro254](https://twitter.com/maro254/) 's article mentioned "rare and mythic rare cycle that you'll be learning about pretty soon", what are they? #mtg #m11

[23:54] Aw man, the number crunch already rules out Char in #m11. I need a replacement for Staggershock, it's kinda bad unless opp's at 4. #mtg #rdw

[12:19] Turn 5/6 Primeval Titan fetching 2 Eldrazi temple. Untap, swing, 2 more Temples, land drop, Emrakul. #mtg

[23:56] I wonder if Wizards will someday have a set with randomly assigned card numbers. Just to screw with number crunchers. #mtg
