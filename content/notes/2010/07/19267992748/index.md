[@wrongwaygoback](https://twitter.com/wrongwaygoback/)  Not sure if #1 is true. Being "good" is largely a function of practice/hard work. 'net/MTGO doesn't change that.

[@wrongwaygoback](https://twitter.com/wrongwaygoback/) if anything, 'net/MTGO accentuates the advantages good players have over everybody else who just picks up a net deck

[@wrongwaygoback](https://twitter.com/wrongwaygoback/) I guess it depends on your definition of "good". I don't consider myself good by any means, am too lazy :p
