Just saw Shutter Island. Where did I read someone comparing it to Inception? Not even close.

Notes from my journal: 

> So I saw Shutter Island yesterday. It's ok, but definitely not as good as Inception. It doesn't help that I was expecting a twist ending from the very start. Also, what made me think Chris Nolan was involved with this one also?
