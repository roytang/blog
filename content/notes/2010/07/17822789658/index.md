White Leyline: Really? RDW died again. Reprint Anarchy! #mtg #m11

<time>[12:27]</time> Slightly disappointed with the remainder of #m11. No Ranger of Eos, no Jace2, no Imperious Perfect, etc. Oh, and no [@Grizzly_Bears](https://twitter.com/Grizzly_Bears/)  #mtg

<time>[19:48]</time> Devastating Force: I love it, but makes me wish we had better signets. #mtg #m11

<time>[19:52]</time> Dark Tutelage: I would miss Phyrexian Arena a bit less if this guy could swing for two. Or at least cost a mana less. #mtg #m11

<time>[19:56]</time> #m11 reminds me of rav block standard. There's hierarch, wildfire, a dark confidant effect, leylines. But yeah, better signets, stat! #mtg
