  "text": "It&#x27;s obvious once you take into account the fact that you&#x27;ll need to wait 15-20 mins on the Shaw station platform before you even manage to get on a train.    The traffic in cubao is irrelevant as long as you take the right bus (since you can choose the bus you ride, it&#x27;s possible to optimize the bus ride, but not the MRT). 90% of the time with a &quot;Fast Lane&quot; bus, you will be past Cubao in 15-20 mins (at the same point, kakasakay mo pa lang sana ng MRT sa Shaw)    You should always favor &quot;Ordinary&quot; buses over aircon for speed because &quot;Ordinary&quot; drivers are more reckless (faster) and more importantly, they never go under the Ortigas flyover.     Some 10% of the time, the traffic on EDSA will be really bad, that&#x27;s the disadvantage (more variance). On the other hand, with an &quot;Ordinary&quot; bus you will easily be able to get a seat and probably even be able to take a nap, which is impossible while standing in the MRT.",
