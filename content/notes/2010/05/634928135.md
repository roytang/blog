Someone on Tumblr asked:

<blockquote>How do you translate &quot;gigil&quot; to English?</blockquote>

<p>Usually refers to an overwhelming urge to do something.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;something&rdquo; is implied by the context, for example if the &ldquo;gigil&rdquo; is directed at something cute, the urge is usually to pinch, i.e.</p>
<p>Tagalog: &ldquo;Ang cute ng baby mo, nakakagigil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>English: &ldquo;Your baby is so cute, I have an overwhelming urge to pinch him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Can also be directed at something frustrating/annoying.</p>

<p>ALSO: I&rsquo;m not a translator, what&rsquo;s up with these questions?</p>
