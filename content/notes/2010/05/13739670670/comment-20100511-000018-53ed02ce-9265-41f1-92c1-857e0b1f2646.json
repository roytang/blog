  "text": "Exactly, that&#x27;s why I said...if we&#x27;re disappointed with the results of the elections, we also share part of the blame because we haven&#x27;t done enough. Hopefully we can do better next time.    The problem of voter education is a pre-existing condition that we&#x27;ve known about for years. Although automation was largely successful, that&#x27;s not a problem it would have solved. At least in some ways our elections are already improving, hopefully in the future we figure out how to solve the voter education problem as well.",
