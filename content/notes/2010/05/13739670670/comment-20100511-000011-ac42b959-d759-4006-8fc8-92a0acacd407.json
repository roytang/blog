  "text": "Exactly. I don&#x27;t feel like I have a right to complain about choices other people made. There was a time when I thought that it was enough that I made an informed choice and did my best effort to communicate that through the channels I was familiar with (facebook/ twitter/etc).     You and I agree it&#x27;s not enough. The question is, what&#x27;s the next step? Or we just going to complain about it, or are we going to search for ways to overcome the problems?",
