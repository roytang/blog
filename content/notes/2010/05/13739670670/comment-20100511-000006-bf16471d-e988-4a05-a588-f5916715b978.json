In a way, it&#x27;s our fault too because we have a mindset that &quot;those people&quot; are to blame and we just give up on them as hopeless instead of putting in effort to help them make better choices.    You&#x27;re saying it&#x27;s hard to change their mindsets. Of course it&#x27;s hard, because we also have to overcome our own mindset that it&#x27;s not possible to help them.",
