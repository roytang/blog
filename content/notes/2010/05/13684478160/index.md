<time>[03:44]</time> can't sleep. will probably stay awake until voting time!

<time>[06:34]</time> Heading out to vote!

<time>[07:20]</time> Voting is done in batches of 10, but the waiting area is filling up faster than batches are sent out. Late votersâ€¦ http://gladlyCast.com/6rd

<time>[08:01]</time> We're told there was a problem w the pcos machine and the first batch has just started voting #halalan

<time>[09:01]</time> Finally done, and sweat-drenched

<time>[09:15]</time> Mine was the 26th ballot cast in my clustered precinct, it took me 2 hrs. Good luck with the 1000 voters #halalan

<time>[10:49]</time> Despite the problems, don't forget to thank the Comelec staff once you're done, they're overworked and underpaid. #halalan

<time>[15:30]</time> My parents just came back from our precinct at Quirino Elementary in Anonas, apparently the lines are much shorter now. #halalan

<time>[20:56]</time> Just woke up from a nap, congrats to everyone who managed to vote today. Let's be vigilant and wait for the election results. #halalan

<time>[21:07]</time> Official results at http://bit.ly/bqpsJ2 (why do I have a feeling this site is going to get hammered) #halalan

<time>[21:32]</time> Seeing Lapid, Revilla, etc. leading in the early results is disheartening &gt;.&lt; Oh Filipino voter, how can we make you grow up? #halalan
