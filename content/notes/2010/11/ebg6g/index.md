#### Posted on r/ipad: [Noob question about apps from the app store](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ebg6g/noob_question_about_apps_from_the_app_store/)

So, I have a non-US billing address so I don't have access to the US app store. Can I create an account for the US app store, then download an app from there and put it on my iPad, together with apps from my main account? 

Sorry for being noobish, I'm new to this Apple thing. :D
