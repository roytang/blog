#### Posted on r/ipad: [Can I "merge" the apps from my iTunes library and my iPad?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ebon9/can_i_merge_the_apps_from_my_itunes_library_and/)

Basically, I just installed iTunes on this machine (had to reformat/reinstall the PC), and downloaded a few apps (using the same iTunes account as the one on my iPad). But when I try to sync the apps with the iPad, iTunes seems to want to delete all the other apps on the iPad. How do I "merge" the libraries?
