Watching: Scott Pilgrim vs the World

Notes from my journal: 

> My brother and I watched Scott Pilgrim vs the world on Sunday. The movie is cool and awesome and pretty much what I expected, but I understand why it wasn't that big a hit financially and some critics criticized it a bit too much. You really need to be a gamer or comics guy to really appreciate it.
