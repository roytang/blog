#### Posted on r/ipad: [Should I jailbreak my iPad?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/ejj7b/should_i_jailbreak_my_ipad/)

I've been using my iPad for a bit more than a month now, and I'm mostly satisfied. I use it for browsing, social networking, ebook reading and s few games. Several people are telling me however that I'm not getting the most out of the device uless I jailbreak it. How true is this, especially for an engineer type who likes to tinker with stuff? Are there any risks or disadvantages to jail breaking? Will I lose my warranty?
