#### Posted on r/AskReddit: [I would like to manage/invest my finances better, where do I start?](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/es1iq/i_would_like_to_manageinvest_my_finances_better/)

Currently my savings are mostly in fixed-interest time deposits (low interest rates around here though) and in personal loans to well-trusted people who repay me on a regular basis.

I would like to branch out my investments to stuff like mutual funds or whatever, but I am a bit ignorant on these matters. I'm just looking for more growth opportunities since some people have told me that I should be growing my money more. Because I'm ignorant, I'm a bit risk-averse, especially with stuff like the stock markets that seem so swingy to me. Any advice on where to start or what stuff I should read first?

Note: I am not an American!
