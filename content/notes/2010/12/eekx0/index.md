#### Posted on r/apple: [Is there a website that tracks/notifies you when apps are on sale/have a price drop on the App Store?](https://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/eekx0/is_there_a_website_that_tracksnotifies_you_when/)

There's something like that for Steam, so I'm wondering if there's such for the app store
