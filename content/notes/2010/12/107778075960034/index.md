This cartoon character meme has actually been around Facebook since two weeks ago, but only started picking up steam after someone cleverly decided to add the bit about child violence. Realistically it does nothing against child violence, but rather it gives those too-serious folks who would otherwise not have gone along with the meme an excuse to do something silly and frivolous. :D
