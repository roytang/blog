Speaking of people we need more of in government...

##### My First 100 days in Government

I was appointed last July 7, 2010, so last Friday – October 15, officially marks my 100th day in government.

What has it been like?

Firstly, it can be EXASPERATING.  

On day 1, I was raring to go with big plans and aggressive timelines, only to be stymied by bureaucratic red tape.  The overarching philosophy of governance is one of mistrust – an assumption that everyone will steal unless prevented and monitored by the almighty COA.

Pre-audits and bidding procedures are designed to discourage arbitrary selection of favored vendors. Good, but it also prevents you from getting reliable partners who are known to deliver, especially for time-sensitive projects. And it’s so time-consuming that you lose out on opportunistic offers.

Last month, we received an offer to place a high-tech video ad at Beijing airport at a very special rate of 9,000 Euros instead of 100,000. The producer was pressed for time, with one of their advertisers pulling out at the last minute, so they were looking for a replacement ad to fill up the time. But they gave us only a week to decide. It was a good deal, and timely too – given that it comes soon after the August 23 hostage incident. But our procurement rules will not allow it. Sayang!

Post-audits are designed to hold signatories accountable. Good, but they also instill fear even to the well-intentioned bureaucrat. Early on, I signed without hesitation projects and financial requests that looked reasonable. Until an old-timer reminded me to be careful – if COA ends up disallowing the requests I sign, I could end up being liable, together with the other signatories, for the full amount. That’s scary, especially since I’m signing requests in the millions of pesos. It’s a sure way to kill innovation and out-of-the-box thinking!

If you think of government as a business, it’s like letting your auditor take charge of all major decisions. And they do so with controls and compliance to rules, rather than the overall good of the business, in mind. No wonder most governments are in deficit.

The irony is people are able to steal just the same. So I think COA should just loosen up and modernize their antiquated rules. And they should train their auditors to give them more business sense.

Then, there is the matter of getting your budget approved. The whole department grinds to a halt, with all of its key officials required to attend, during Congressional hearings on the budget. And to what end? To hear out what, even by their own admission, are parochial concerns.

There is really only one question, but couched in so many ways – “What is your department doing for my district?”  It’s not easy to answer, especially for a Department whose mandate is to bring in tourists, not to serve districts or provinces.

There’s a lot of grandstanding and horse-trading in these sessions. But, to be fair, there were also a good number of congressmen and senators who made sense and offered their support and even good ideas. Some of them even came from politicians, whom I considered in the past as hard-core tradpols. What a pleasant surprise!

Still, I think government can better be served if the initial number-crunching is left to the technical working groups of the Department and Congress. Then, a grilling session of the Secretary, with a handful of support staff (instead of practically the whole Department), can be done by the joint Congress-Senate committee. Said joint committee should have limited membership to speed up the process.

I know it’s probably asking too much, given that this is the only opportunity for legislators to exact blood from the Departments. But I’m still a dreamer at heart.

Secondly, it is EXHAUSTING.

A typical day would consist of meetings every hour on the hour from 9 am to 5 pm, and then an hour to sign and sift through all documents that come to my table. In between or after office, I have to attend to official functions – from ribbon-cutting to giving a talk.

That’s why I try to be at the office as early as 7 am, so I can have time to organize work, focus on strategies, or even just respond to pending emails. And I thought all along that a bureaucrat’s work is much easier compared to his counterpart in the private sector.

I can always turn down some meeting requests to lighten the load. But as a neophyte bureaucrat, I try to accommodate as many meeting requests as possible – whether from people looking for business, asking for help, offering help or simply paying courtesies.  It broadens my perspective, helps shape the Department’s strategies, and often recasts my own views and biases about tourism. So far, it has proven to be worthwhile.

What really sap my energy are the many problems that we have to deal with. There are the nagging industry problems like the FAA downgrade, and the EU blacklist, now compounded by the HK blacklist. There are issues on taxes and visa. Most of these will require interagency initiatives – not an easy thing to do. And yet, they have a serious impact on our tourist arrivals.

We’re also in transition towards a new structure prescribed by the Tourism Act of 2009. It naturally comes with organizational and implementation problems that are not easy to disentangle. Expectations are high. And we’re trying to implement as much as what the law requires even while the budget that was approved is based on the old structure.

What helps, and this comes as another pleasant surprise, is the high level of competence of the people in the Department. There are a good number of people who are not only highly qualified, but who are also motivated and self-driven. It shatters my stereotype view of the mediocre government employee who is willing to settle for a much smaller pay compared to what he can get from the private sector. Surprises never end!

Finally, it is also EXHILIRATING.

The VIP treatment, the attention – to the point of pandering that you receive, and the authority that comes with the position all add up to give you a sense of power that is both exhilarating and potentially addictive.

And to think that I only hold an Undersecretary position.  You can just imagine what it’s like in higher positions. No wonder some people will go through great lengths just to stay in power.

That’s why my prayer is for God to keep my feet on the ground and to constantly remind me that He placed me here to serve, and not to be served.

Funny how the same things I’ve been saying in the streets during the last 5 years, now has more weight because of the position I hold. Back then, it was good sound bite picked up my media. Now, whatever I say can be interpreted as policy. That’s why I’m a bit more circumspect in the pronouncements I make, official or otherwise.

When Tony Blair spoke in a forum at Ateneo last year, he said, “When you’re in the opposition, you are measured by what you say. But when you’re in the administration, you are measured by what you do.”

Which brings me back to the very reason why I joined government in the first place. We have been shouting at the top of our voice in the streets, clamoring for change. Now that we have a President who shares our aspirations, we are given the rare opportunity to make real the very same change we have been clamoring for, as part of his administration.

I’d like to think that we, as Black and White Movement, did very well as part of the opposition, not only by what we said, but also in the way we said it – often rising as the lone voice of truth in the wilderness. We got high scores when measured by what we said.

Now that I’m with the administration, I certainly will work hard to get equally high scores when the time comes to be measured by what we have done.

There are many challenges and constraints. There is so much work to be done. Still, I know that I am in the best position to make change happen. And the idea of being able to effect change is simply exhilarating.
