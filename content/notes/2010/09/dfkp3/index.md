#### Posted on r/gaming: [Telltale Games has Tales of Monkey Island (all 5 episodes) on sale for $4.95](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/dfkp3/telltale_games_has_tales_of_monkey_island_all_5/)

Are these as good as the first two Monkey Island games? I enjoyed them as a kid but haven't played the newer ones.

Also, is Telltale Games ok? Do they work like Steam?
