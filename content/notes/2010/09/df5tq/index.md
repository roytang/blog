#### Posted on r/AskReddit: [Why aren't lawyers required when interrogating suspects?](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/df5tq/why_arent_lawyers_required_when_interrogating/)

I live in a country where criminal defendants often retract confessions saying they were tortured or coerced into making those confessions. So I was thinking: why not require that the suspect have a lawyer present during any police interrogation, otherwise any statements made during such interrogation would not be admissible in court?

I remember there was an online video being passed around where even if you were innocent you should not talk to the police; if this view is recognized and the general consensus is that you should never talk to the police without a lawyer anyway, why not formalize it so that ignorant people are automatically protected and police are not tempted to coerce confessions out of suspects?
