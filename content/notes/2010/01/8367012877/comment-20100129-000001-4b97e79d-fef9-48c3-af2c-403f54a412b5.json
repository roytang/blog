  "text": "ANCALERTS was posting on twitter live during the Youth 2010 forums earlier today. This was Gibo&#x27;s response to the question on whether GMA should be held accountable, and kung ano ung pinakamabigat na issue.    This man is basically applying for a job, and during the interview he says &quot;I will not answer your question.&quot; Try it in your next interview!    He&#x27;s in a rough spot - if he says GMA is clean, voters will hate him. If he says GMA is corrupt, GMA/Lakas will hate him. ",
