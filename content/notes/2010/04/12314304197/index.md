Heading out for the Rise of Eldrazi prerelease #mtg

<time>[23:43]</time> only went 2-2 at the prerelease. got blown out by an overrun effecct at common (Wildheart Invoker) and lost to UW aggro, lots of fliers

<time>[2010-04-18 10:15]</time> Argh, I just found out I had misread Wildheart Invoker during the prerelease! I thought it affected all his creatures! &gt;.&lt; #mtg
