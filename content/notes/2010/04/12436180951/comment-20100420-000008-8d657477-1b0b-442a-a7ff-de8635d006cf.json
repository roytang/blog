  "text": "Note that I already have a laptop with relatively good specs (not top end, but ok); that&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m looking for here, the focus of the reqt is on mobility.    @Paul - the alienware m11x retails here for 70+k I&#x27;m not going to spend that much and I&#x27;m not specifically looking for a gaming machine, I already have a desktop for that. You basically recommended a laptop that YOU want.  :p    @Rumz - &lt;30k is good; 30-40k can be considered depending on value. Is there a specific model of thinkpad you recommend?    @Clement - &quot;coding&quot; here really just means it should have a sensible keyboard I won&#x27;t have trouble typing with.  :D    @Morris - any specific model you think is ok? The inexpensive part is hard, but in theory pwede din kahit slightly used.",
