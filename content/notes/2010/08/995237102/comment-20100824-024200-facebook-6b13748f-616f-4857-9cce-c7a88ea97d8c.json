  "text": "The shogun mini-series was a fresh take on the novel, and its nice how they dealt with the language barrier between toronaga and blackthorne. Maybe they dont bother to export japanese cinema too much, and we're missing on a lot. I remember watching a good period movie on a flight, involving only politics and intrigue inside the Imperial Castle, set during a war, and there werent even any sword fights. on the not too serious side, quite animae-esque, but Zatoichi\" easily comes to mind.\"",
