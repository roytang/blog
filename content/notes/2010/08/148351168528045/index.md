If you receive weird links in the mail or in FB chat, make sure to verify with the sender if he really sent that message. I just got 2 messages today (one in email, one in FB chat) that were obviously some sort of scams. If you encounter one, notify the sender and ask them to change their passwords.  Remember not to click any links that are suspicious!
