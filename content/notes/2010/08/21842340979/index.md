Someone cast Pacifism on my Balloon Brigade. Then I cast Pacifism on his Squadron Hawk. Mine was less awkward, so I won. #m11 #draft

<time>[12:35]</time> I played Act of Treason on my opponent's Yavimaya Wurm for just enough damage to win. Apparently, "that was gay" #m11 #draft

<time>[12:51]</time> Nothing quite like losing a match because you played Act of Treason on an opponent's Primeval Titan then failed to attack with it. =/
