Watched Expendables with the JV crew.

Notes from my journal: 

> The Expendables was okay, action-packed movie but with some lame lines/jokes that we believe were written by Stallone as he co-wrote the screenplay. We were imagining him going "oh, this is going to be so cool, the audience is going to love it", etc.
