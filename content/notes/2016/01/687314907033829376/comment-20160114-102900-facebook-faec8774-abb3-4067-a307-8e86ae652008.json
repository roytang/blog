  "text": "I think this goes for all John Williams scores... but a lot of times they have specific elements that's not necessarily associated with the movie. Jaws is suspenseful, even without the thought of sharks. Hedwig's Flight is inherently light and \"feathery\" but people associate it with magic. The imperial march can sound triumphant to someone who didn't know Darth Vader. And Superman is definitely about some old-school newswriter, with that morse code leitmotif being the base of the rhythm.<br/>So... yes it reminds us of adventure because we associate it with Indiana Jones.",
