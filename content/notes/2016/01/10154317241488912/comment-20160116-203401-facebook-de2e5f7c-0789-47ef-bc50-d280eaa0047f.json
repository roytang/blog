  "text": "I read the Medium article written by Mike Hearn (thanks to  Marnielle  for sharing). I've been avoiding the mainstream media's interpretation of it. I tried reading NY Times article about it but didn't like the simplified version. I have been reading people's comments on reddit. I'm still optimistic about Bitcoin, although I recognize it's a serious issue. His complaints are valid and I don't see how it will get resolved. There are some predictions on how things will play out, and while plausible, I can't imagine how it will get there (e.g. dual currency like gold/silver where Bitcoin transaction volume stays limited but another digital currency will be used for everyday transactions; or the new Bitcoin forks). For now, I'm cautious, and as always, I've seen my investment more as a gamble which can go to zero or to thousands of dollars per BTC. I'd like to hear Andreas Antonopoulos' next talk where he will share his opinions on the matter, but it's difficult to get a truly neutral, expert opinion at this stage. The experts who are pro Bitcoin are invested too much in it that their judgements are probably influenced by it.",
