"So this is my wish, a wish for me as much as it is a wish for you: in the world to come, let us be brave â€“ let us walk into the dark without fear, and step into the unknown with smiles on our faces, even if we're faking them."

[Neil Gaiman's Journal: New Year's Wishes and gifts](https://shar.es/163lM6)
