Finished watching Westworld. It's pretty good. Once you get introduced to the premise of the show, it's easy to imagine where it goes from there - these types of stories tend to go in that particular direction. Where the show shines is the narrative, the way the events unfold, everything is very well done. Some things from the earlier episodes are quite vague, unclear or sometimes downright contradictory, but things clear up pretty well near the end of the 10-episode run, though a number of things are still left hanging (including the fates of the surviving characters) for the presumptive season two to help clear up.  Not for kids. Lots of violence and nudity and whatnot.  Also, there's a post-credits scene.
