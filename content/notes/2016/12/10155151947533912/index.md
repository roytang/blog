Okay, let's review:

1. Duterte reinstates cops suspended for involvement in illegal drugs. Supposedly he wants to keep them in place to be able to investigate and track their movements. He confirms that Marcos is involved in illegal shit. 
2. These cops go on to kill inmates in custody, while they are in their position where they could supposedly be investigated and tracked.
3. Senators say it looks like an extra judicial killing
4. NBI says it's a rubout
5. Duterte still supports the cops (who he already admitted were involved in illegal shit) and won't allow them to go to prison

My creative imagination is failing me, can someone tell me how this isn't coddling of murderers?
