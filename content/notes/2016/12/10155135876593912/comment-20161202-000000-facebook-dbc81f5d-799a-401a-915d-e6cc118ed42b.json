  "text": "Roy, if every policeman could be trusted to follow procedure, we wouldn't be needing to be reminded what to do and what rights we should be having. This is exactly to counter those excesses. But be reminded to assert your rights in a respectful manner. They still have guns and u don't. As my professor once said, bring the battle outside their arena, bring it to the court room.",
