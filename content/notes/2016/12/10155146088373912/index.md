So far no unexpected announcements. I think we can reasonably expect Strange, Rocket, Iron Fist, etc to make it back (all the MCU ones). I kinda hope we get Jane Foster Thor, but given MCU it's likely to be Odinson. With Captain Marvel in there I doubt we'll have Miss Marvel (hopefully I'm mistaken.) Having Miles Morales Spider-man would be great too, but realistically he might only be a skin for the Peter Parker one. They have not ruled out X-Men characters, and the roster is supposedly huge, so maybe some old favorites will still come back.
