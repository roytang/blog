So the United Nations General Assembly voted in favor of a resolution to aid in the investigation of the War Crimes in Syria. The Philippines voted to Abstain.

It is unsurprising but still disappointing, nevertheless. What's to expect from a government who chooses to keep mum while its President openly endorses killings all in the name of War on Drugs?

And oh, we didn't know the Philippines ITSELF is pro-Assad. You didn't either?

Well, now you know.
