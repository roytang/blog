The sad thing is, his ardent followers won't even skip a beat. Some will even cheer him on. 

I'm curious as to what the president could possibly say or do to make his ardent supporters lose faith in him. I mean, he's already admitted to planting evidence, going out looking for fights, personally killing people, and outright lying/making excuses. Or do they find that all of these are okay as long as "his intentions are good" and "madami naman syang nagagawang mabuti"? (Both of which are arguments raised by ardent supporters of another infamous former president, coincidentally.) If one is already willing to look past evidence tampering and murder, it would seem that you are willing to forgive anything.
