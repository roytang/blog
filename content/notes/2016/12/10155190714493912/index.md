New theory: what if there are actually two Dutertes? Like he has a secret twin brother. The good twin is all for good governance, following the law, etc. The evil twin is all murder-y and shoot-y and swear-y, but they have no choice but to trot him out in public because good twin is sickly and can't attend all the events he has to attend.

Maybe I should write this into a short story...
