ROGUE ONE Spoiler-free review:

- it's great. As a Star Wars fan, I was very happy with the movie!
- K-2SO best droid ever
- a lot of great shots that really show the scale of things: star destroyers, the death star, etc
- a fun, great movie to watch, with the tension rising almost throughout the entire movie.
- You already know how it ends, but the tension is so well-done that you're worried that history might change!
- IMAX? The big screen was a plus, but the 3d wasn't much. IMAX optional.
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Probably not, madaming itatanong.
- Mid/post credits scene: None.
- R1 > TFA (!)
