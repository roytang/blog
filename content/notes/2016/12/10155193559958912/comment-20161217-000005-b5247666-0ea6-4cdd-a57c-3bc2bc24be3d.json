What do you think, 5 more years, or 10 more years before SFX clears it?",

I don't think straightforward  hardware and software improvements will take it the rest of the way.    Although who knows, maybe they just need to do some mocap with tissue penetrating lasers that can read the muscles underneath the skin of an actor doing expressions and it'll be right there next year.",

That would be interesting if they can eventually make a system that can read in all of a dead actor's scenes over his career and reconstruct his face and expressions perfectly. Well, wouldn't need to be an actor--could be anybody if there's enough film of them, so public figures.",
