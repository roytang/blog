Wow, this is great. "Keep him there so I can keep track of his movements and investigate him," then that same person goes to issue a search warrant in the dead of night and executes a prisoner under the custody of law enforcement while the CCTV record mysteriously vanishes. Good job on keeping track and investigating him! I'm sure the family of that slain prisoner totally appreciate it!

Sounds like such a completely, totally valid reason that your subordinate wouldn't feel like he had to hold back on any details at all.

"The PNP chief denied that it was Go who called him and dared De Lima to name her source. Dela Rosa said the caller was also not Duterte, who he said was his ninong or godfather."

Waaaiiiit, is this part correct (I literally do not know if the above statements are accurate)? Does this mean the PNP chief flat-out lied to us?
