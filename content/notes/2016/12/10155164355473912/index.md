I wonder if our society would have more respect/awareness for legal processes if we had more locally-produced legal dramas or police procedurals. Or kahit itagalize na lang nila yung The Practice and Criminal Minds lol.  Edit: In addition to respect, I think we also need more awareness. Like, people who get tokhang'ed should know they have a right to an attorney before signing any sort of waiver. They should know that the police can't just pick them up and drag them to the station for no reason. They should know that they don't have to let them into their homes if walang search warrant. Etc.
