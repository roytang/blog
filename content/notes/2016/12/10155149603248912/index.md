  To each and everyone of you who sent birthday greetings to this old man, please accept my truest gratitude.
  <br/>
  In these perilous times when truth is debased and history is revised, it is easy for those of us who belong to the helpless mass to be even more despondent knowing as we do that the powerful can commit crimes with impunity. But listen to all the young people who never experienced the tyranny of Marcos. They are out in the streets, shouting hoarsely NEVER AGAIN! This is most heartwarming and inspiring to me, and to those of us who survived that darkness.
  <br/>
  Now, I think I will be able to continue this new novel, tentatively titled Esperanza.
