  "text": "I would be content with Supreme verdict over anger. People, in my experience, do not like that suggestion. Take it how you will. I have played with these cards a lot... A whole lot, and I'm risking a down vote to tell you that anger against affinity can be very good, or very frustrating. I believe you need something to deal with a potential etched champion. I'm sure you know why :). Anger doesn't do the trick. I will definitely push for that other stony silence. I wouldn't run counterflux over a second crumble to dust also.\n\nMy suggestion\n\n1 Celestial Purge\n\n2 Crumble to dust\n\n1 Dispel\n\n2 Negate\n\n1 Engineered Explosives\n\n1 izzet Staticaster \n\n1 Relic\n\n2 Stony Silence\n\n2 Supreme verdict\n\n1 Timely Reinforcements\n\n1 Wear/Tear\n\nPersonally I'm a fan of an alternative win condition. If you will note the trends of most recent Nahiri Jeskai list. They are consistently packing 2-3 geist in the sideboard. Due to your decks similar function, you may consider dropping relic and staticaster for a couple.\n\nhttp://www.mtgtop8.com/compare \n\nAs a reference.\n\nElspeth, sun's champion opposed to Tamiyo maybe?\n\nThis deck is awesome BTW. I am currently playing Jeskai Nahiri and considered briefly playing this planeswalker build, simply because I like a super friends style :). As a spike I must remind you Nahiri will be your best route to play this style too, but I believe you know that.  Here is what I'm currently running. Just to share.\n\n http://decks.deckedbuilder.com/d/214714\n\n\n\n",
