   Sure, there has always been violence all around the Philippines even in PNoy or GMA's administration.

  But you know what the difference is? That violence is now justified. That violence is now made right. That violence is seen by many as part of progress and development. (Edit: maybe this violence was also made right by GMA who kept killing activists via Jovito Palparan? -- Another story). But hey, as I was saying, that's the difference.

  On a more personal note, I seriously have never been more scared to go out of my house and commute to work. With all the killings happening in public spaces especially in public utility vehicles, who's not to say that the next person I sit beside or the driver of the jeepney or tricycle I will ride in, is a drug addict who's in the list of people to kill? Pucha. Ayoko maging kasama sa collateral damage. Kayo na lang kung trip niyo.

  P.S. Actually, yung mga nagsasabi na okay lang magkaron ng collateral damage eh bat nga ba di na lang kayo, ano? Okay lang naman pala eh. Eh di offer yourselves up para di nadadamay yung mga ayaw madamay.
