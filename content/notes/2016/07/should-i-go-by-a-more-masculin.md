Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Should I go by a more masculine name as a programmer?](https://www.quora.com/Should-I-go-by-a-more-masculine-name-as-a-programmer/answer/Roy-Tang)


No, use whatever name you are comfortable with. If there’s anyone who would judge your competence by either your name or your gender, you are better off not working with such people.
