Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [If you know you want to impact the world in some way, but you don't know where you want your impact to be made, how do you decide?](https://www.quora.com/If-you-know-you-want-to-impact-the-world-in-some-way-but-you-dont-know-where-you-want-your-impact-to-be-made-how-do-you-decide/answer/Roy-Tang)


<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You search for it. You try different things, until you find that place where you’re most comfortable and can do as much as you can without sacrificing your own happiness. You might find the right place, you might not, but for sure along the way you will grow as a person and gain valuable insight and probably help a few lives along the way</p></span>
