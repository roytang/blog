Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [In what ways are good programmers like ninjas?](https://www.quora.com/In-what-ways-are-good-programmers-like-ninjas/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good programmers are like ninjas when they are able to get in and make bug fixes and get out without being detected and without disturbing their surroundings. The only indication they were there is that the bug is already fixed (well, and maybe some commit logs and unit tests)</p></span>
