Start an exercise regimen. It doesn’t have to be anything complicated, just something that gets you moving is fine. Like, walking around your neighborhood for 30 mins to an hour. Do it at the same time every day too, to make it easier to become a habit. Just moving around a bit will train your body to give you more energy during the day.

Don’t skip breakfast. Skipping breakfast gives you less energy throughout the day.

Look for new hobbies, especially ones that have you do something on a regular basis. Don’t be afraid to try a bunch of stuff and just discard anything that doesn’t stick.

Spending some time doing nothing is fine in moderation though
