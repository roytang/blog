  "text": "Staggered rationalization  of local government taxes is the more effective means of decentralizing growth.  For my company, Makati LGT is 0.2%, Muntinlupa and some cities in visayas is 0.5%, highest is 0.75%.    Makati is lowest in the entire country.  It matters when gross revenue is in the hundred millions or billions.  Kaya nagsisiksikan ang mga malalaking negosyo dun.  They will just create satellite office if capital is relocated.  Bulk of transactions will still be done in Makati.  In fact big clients will request that their transaction be done in Makati, just incur transportation expense, in order to reduce total amount they have to settle.",
