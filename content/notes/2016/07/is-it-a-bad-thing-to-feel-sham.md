Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Is it a bad thing to feel shame for using 21st century tools to better my life?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-bad-thing-to-feel-shame-for-using-21st-century-tools-to-better-my-life/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Why would you be ashamed? These are the times we live in, so you use the tools that are available. Should cavemen have been ashamed for using fire? Should pilots be ashamed for flying airplanes? Should we be ashamed for answering questions over the internet?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It seems like a silly thing to feel shame over. It benefits no one to have such an attitude, so I would suggest setting it aside.</p></span>
