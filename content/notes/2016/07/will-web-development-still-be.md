> [Will Web Development still be a viable career in 30 Years?](https://www.quora.com/Will-Web-Development-still-be-a-viable-career-in-30-Years/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Unlikely.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Thirty years ago, the concept of web development did not even exist. Technology marches forward at an even faster pace now. In the next thirty years it is very likely that there will be new mediums of communication that become more popular and overtake the web in use</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That is not to say that skills in web development will become useless in thirty years, it’s just that it’s likely that those skills will need to be adapted to whatever new technologies emerge. This is always true of programming in general - one needs to be familiar with the changing technology landscape to keep yourself up-to-date</p></span>
