  "text": "Siguro ayaw nila na sa network nila dadaan congested na kasi sila at baon ang companya sa marketing related expenses hehehe  We'll never know why, I guess because it's a duopoly.  Oh well ma regulate din yang mga yan balang araw.  Buy in and cooperation is what's needed at the moment, even grudgingly.  Mas mabuti na meron kaysa wala sa ngayon.     Most people have more than one mobile number anyway. And once the reason is gone, no more prank calls, there will also be no reason to keep the high rate.",
