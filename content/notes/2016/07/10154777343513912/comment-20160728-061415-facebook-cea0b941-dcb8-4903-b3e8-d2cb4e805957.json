If say, we conservatively assume 10 emergency calls (it could be more, especially for big barangays) routed via Globe network and at P5 each call, then that totals to 2,101,400 per day or 767,011,000 per year of revenue stream.  Almost 1 billion! And they are only using existing network.  \ud83d\udc7f \ud83d\udc7f \ud83d\udc7f  Disgusting!",
