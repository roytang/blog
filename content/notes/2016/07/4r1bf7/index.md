#### Posted on r/Terraria: [Complete noob here: Can anyone tell me why this isn't valid housing?](https://reddit.com/r/Terraria/comments/4r1bf7/complete_noob_here_can_anyone_tell_me_why_this/)

I hope this is allowed here. Here's the image: http://images.akamai.steamusercontent.com/ugc/271722299887389431/FEE9212EB40FDCE051A7D7FD774C3E4CBD1775E2/

I mean, my understanding was that I just need a table, chair and light? Am I missing something else? All the walls are dirt blocks if that matters.
