Finally watched the president's inaugural speech. Very good, concise, hits a lot of the right notes. Still focused on his law and order/illegal drugs platforms and acknowledged and addressed criticisms directly. Very presidential, and thus very different from his behavior during the campaign. Hopefully he manages to live up to his words (and maybe gets some sense in his head re: Marcos)
