Despite the glaring silence by the administration on the ongoing extrajudicial killings and the high number of police kills na "nanlaban" or "nangagaw ng baril", I was prepared to give the administration the benefit of the doubt that it was not directly involved in such nefarious activities, but pronouncements such as these and supporters openly attacking the senator proposing to investigate them hints that the administration, if not directly involved, is at the very least openly abetting these misdeeds.  Trading one form of crimes (drugs) for another (extrajudicial killings) is very far from "eradicating crime". The saddest part is all those people who choose to remain silent because they have already decided in their hearts months before that this is all acceptable to them
