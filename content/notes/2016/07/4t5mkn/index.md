#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Any Color Me Badd fans here? Need some help](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4t5mkn/any_color_me_badd_fans_here_need_some_help/)

I'm looking for anyone who has a physical CD copy of their album "Time and Chance", specifically the Philippine release. This version has an extra track at the end titled "I Remember", which does not appear in most releases in other countries. I am not sure which countries' releases had this track, but for sure it is in the Ph version. I would like to get a digital copy of this track. It is not on iTunes, Spotify, torrents, etc, so the best chance is if someone could rip it from the actual CD. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!
