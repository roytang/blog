> "There are those who would like to focus on the extrajudicial killings. They have reason to be disturbed and object, of course. Society cannot respect the law and tolerate its open violation at the same time. But my personal understanding of the state of affairs is that the pressure being exerted by a determined President and the leadership of the PNP will necessarily result in extrajudicial killings. Even without higher authorities ordering policemen or death squads to actually kill drug pushers and users, killings will occur.

> The PNP leadership has claimed that the drug lords are killing their own kind, mainly to protect themselves from being identified and hunted down. It is equally as true as far as dirty policemen and other public officials who have been part of the illegal drug trade. They, too, are motivated to kill those who can identify and testify against them. No one is admitting they are doing the killing so who will the President and General De la Rosa prosecute and punish?
> 
> But there will come a time when the killing will taper down, and those who killed in the shadow of the Duterte priority to rid Philippine society of the drug scourge will themselves be identifiedâ€”or killed by the families and friends of those they executed. It is improbable that President Duterte will ease off, and the same is true of the PNP leadership. In the weeks to come, mayors and other public officials will be named as suspects or protectors of the drug trade. More extrajudicial killings will ensue before they ease up."

I'm glad this article recognizes that this administration is fostering an environment that encourages killings, albeit framing it as a necessary evil of the so-called "drug war". It is exactly this cost that I and many others are unwilling to accept as necessary (along with the fact that many of our citizens actively cheer on such activities) in order to fight a brutal "war" that even other countries are starting to realize is costly and pointless

I'm not even convinced the violence will taper off, there is nothing pointing towards that assertion.
