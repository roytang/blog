<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You will need to consider several things. First, to ensure survival:</p><ul><li>where will you live? How much will it cost?</li><li>what is the average cost of daily living where you plan to go?</li><li>will you be able to find a job that pays a sufficient wage?</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You will need to brace yourself, more likely than not you will be encountering difficulties that you have not encountered before. You may need to accept work beneath your skill level (largely depends on your situation). You may need to power through some difficult times before you manage to settle in and be in a good place</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">good luck!</p></span>
