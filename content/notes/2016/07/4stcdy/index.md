#### Posted on r/tipofmyjoystick: [[Famicom][1990-1992] Some sort of metroidvania](https://reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/4stcdy/famicom19901992_some_sort_of_metroidvania/)

**Platform(s):**

Famicom (probably no NES version)

**Genre:**

RPG/Platformer/Metroidvania

**Estimated year of release:**

1990-1992

**Graphics/art style:**

**Notable characters:**

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**

**Other details:**

A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance. It was some sort of primitive metroidvania-style 2d platformer with exploratory elements. The character was I think some kind of bluish knight kind of person with a sword. This is all I have to go on unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
