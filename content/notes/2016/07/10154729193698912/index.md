It's a bit funny (or maybe sad). During the campaign period, some people cried "trial by publicity!" or "innocent until proven guilty!" when Trillianes was hurling accusations; those same people now see nothing wrong with the name and shame campaign vs a lot more people, and some even praise it as "brilliant strategy". Either both are wrong or both are okay, you can't have it both ways
