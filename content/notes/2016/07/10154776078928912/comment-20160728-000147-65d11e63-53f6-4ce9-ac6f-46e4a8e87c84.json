  "text": "mainitindihan ko kung hindi priority yung mga killings outside of police operations  dahil nga it&#x27;s a question of resources for the pnp diba? i mean, if you have a highly prioritized war going on, and you&#x27;re pursuing a watchlist of 3million people. The danger is real na mawala sa process yung  vigilante killings lalo na kung yung victim nasa watchlist na rin ng mga pulis.  They can be treated as one less suspect to pursue. important work talaga yung keeping track of these killings to make the police account for them soonest. CSO work yan (mga HR groups or groups like VACC)",
