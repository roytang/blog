(the serious attempt to implement the law is ground zero of these killings.. whether by legit police operations, rubouts, internal purging by the drug trade, community vigilante killings, etc). but we should never lose sight of the fact crimes are never to be tolerated. kaya importante yung gathering of data for evidence purposes para maayos mga procedures KUNG kulang.",

They claim to have a lot of intelligence re: drug lords so if attributable to drug lords talaga yung cardboard killings, baka naman meron na silang idea",

The danger is real na mawala sa process yung  vigilante killings lalo na kung yung victim nasa watchlist na rin ng mga pulis.  They can be treated as one less suspect to pursue. important work talaga yung keeping track of these killings to make the police account for them soonest.
