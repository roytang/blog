  "text": "Lahat naman tayo matutuwa if i-strengthen yung institutions, hindi yung tipong inuundermine yung independent bodies for example by attacking senators when they propose to investigate, or telling the CHR chain to shut up, etc. I&#x27;m not sure if the PNP has come out with any statement saying they are investigating the cardboard killings or if they have any leads, etc. Understandably mahirap talaga sya ma-trace, but they should let the people know they are doing something. They claim to have a lot of intelligence re: drug lords so if attributable to drug lords talaga yung cardboard killings, baka naman meron na silang idea",
