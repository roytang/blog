#### Posted on r/ModernMagic: [Jeskai sideboard choices](https://reddit.com/r/ModernMagic/comments/4rspgd/jeskai_sideboard_choices/)

Hey, looking for some advice. Here's the deck I played at the last tournament: http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=12828&d=274476&f=MO

I'm mostly fine with the main deck (except maybe Tamiyo, a bit weak, if I think of something better in that slot I might swap her out). I'm not playing Nahiri because I don't have time to get them before Saturday, and also because I'm quite used to this build already and in Modern I prefer piloting the deck I already really know

I'm thinking of tweaking the sideboard. No idea the meta to expect for this weekend's WMCQ so I want to hit as wide a base as possible.

Permission magic: 

- Thinking of changing 1 Negate 2 Dispel to 2 Negate 1 Dispel to give better game against Tron
- Counterflux. This slot is really only good vs Storm, is it worth it? I figure vs Storm you just always stop the start of the storm chain instead of the end, so maybe not worth it?

Anti-aggro:

- 2 Supreme Verdict or 1 Anger of the Gods + 1 Supreme Verdict? Or should I free up another slot and have 1 Anger + 2 Verdict?
- is Shatterstorm even good against Affinity or should I have 2 Stony Silence instead? (I don't have the 2nd Stony yet though...)

GY hate:

- Relic or RIP? RIP turns off GY stuff forever while Relic is a one-off, but RIP is symmetrical so it turns off my own Snaps

Edit: Also, is there some guide somewhere that tells me what's the optimal number to choose for EE in various matchups? I just got this EE, so I'm not to used to boarding it in.

Any other suggestions? What matchups should I look out for? Thanks!
