Between Affleck (DC Cinematic), Conroy (DC Animated), Arnett (Lego), Troy Baker (Telltale), and Mazouz (TV/Gotham), this has to be a record as to the most number of actors playing Batman/Bruce Wayne in upcoming projects (maybe for any character ever). I guess we should be happy the Arrowverse doesn't have a Bruce Wayne yet
