#### Posted on r/gaming: [Reddit, help me remember an old Famicom game](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/4staxl/reddit_help_me_remember_an_old_famicom_game/)

A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance. It was some sort of primitive metroidvania-style 2d platformer with exploratory elements. The character was I think some kind of bluish knight kind of person with a sword. This is all I have to go on unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
