#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Should I expect Jace, Vryn's Prodigy to tank in price once it's out of Standard?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/4s3tmz/should_i_expect_jace_vryns_prodigy_to_tank_in/)

I'm looking to focus on Modern until maybe end of the year, so I probably won't be using my Jace playset until it rotates out. I like to keep a playset around of mythics I enjoyed using though, but in this case, would it be better to sell them off now (while he still has another set's worth of time in standard legality) and rebuy later?
