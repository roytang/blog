#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Crowdsourcing constructive criticism: what constructive suggestions do you have for the current administration to allay concerns especially on violence and extrajudicial/vigilante killings?](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4xohqs/crowdsourcing_constructive_criticism_what/)

For example, some suggestions I would make:

- for the president to come out with a strongly worded message enjoining law enforcement to observe proper procedures, rules of engagement and due process
- provide regular summary reports, probably weekly of the progress of the "drug war": how many buy bust operations, how many drug dealers captured alive, how many died in encounters, how many died while in custody, and so on
- provide and publicize a channel/process for family members of people alleged killed unjustly in police operations to air their grievances and file cases. Provide protection and legal counsel (via the PAO?) as needed
- related to above, appoint someone to be in charge of investigating extrajudicial killings. that person should provide regular weekly update reports on the cases being investigated and act as a spokesman for the PNP (I assume he would be from the PNP) on this matter and liaise with the senate and the CHR for any investigations
- provide regular reports on the status of the vigilante/cardboard killing cases

etc. 

Edit, some additional:

- automatically perform autopsy on any alleged criminals killed in a police encounter. Check for powder burns, prints on the weapon, and so on, and regularly release these autopsy reports to promote transparency
- conduct re-training for police on how to handle suspects in custody to avoid "nang-agaw ng baril" even though naka handcuffs. Punish policemen na naagawan pa rin ng baril kahit nakaposas na
