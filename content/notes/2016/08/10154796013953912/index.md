SUICIDE SQUAD Spoiler-Free Review:

- a fun, wild ride. Explosions and gunfire and creepy tentacles abound
- just don't expect too much from the plot or characterization. There was more than one scene where I was like WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
- I liked the soundtrack
- very much a Deadshot/Harley movie, other characters not given much back story
- I still like Ledger's joker over Leto's. Leto's portrayal is like crazy gangster
- I had no idea who the big bad was going in, so that's something. Task Force X completely over their heads
- hard to compare to the other DC movies so far, as it goes in a completely different direction
- one mid-credits scene, no post-credits
- magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. Also, madaming tatanungin
