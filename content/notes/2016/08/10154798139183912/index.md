Hmm, are procurement contracts here decided on the basis of price alone? I've worked with proposals for procurement contracts in other countries, and they always involve two sets of scoring: one for how well the bid fulfills contract requirements (with both mandatory and optional requirements), and a separate score for the price, with the two scores being combined for some sort of weighted final score. I always assumed our government did something similar
