I have this theory that the reason fanatics assume that anyone who criticizes the administration is a "pro-Aquino yellowtard" is that they don't understand any other possible way of thinking. They have subsumed their identity to their perceived demigod (who can do no wrong and whose words are gospel) and anyone who dares question him can only be the heathen fanatic followers of a false god. Because they think this way, they believe everyone else does so too. They have no choice but to cheer on every inane thing their demigod does because they have surrendered their identities to his persona.
