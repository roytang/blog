  I understand why people think that media outfits like ABS-CBN, GMA and the Philippine Daily Inquirer are biased. What I don't understand is why people believe these blogs whose authors and agenda are unknown. What makes them believe they are more reliable?

  When writing a thesis or dissertation, most if not all of these blogs wouldn't be acceptable as sources. Yet, people share their posts anyway. Is it because these blogs agree with their world view? What has happened to critical thinking?
