I wonder if my respect for due process is because in software development, if you go cowboy without any sort of process things will tend to break down and descend into chaos. I've been in crazy projects with a lot of problems but I've never wanted to skip process like testing, verification, triage, etc. Imagine if your project lead was like this crazy cowboy where he's all "fix lang tayo ng fix, wag na tayo magverify, we only have 3-6 months, my god i hate bugs!", tapos pag umalma yung testing lead sasabihan sya ng "wag ka magulo, sasabihan ko yung devs na wag ka respetuhin"
