I have this theory that the reason fanatics assume that anyone who criticizes the administration is a "pro-Aquino yellowtard" is that (1/?)

they don't understand any other possible way of thinking (2/?)

They have subsumed their identity to their perceived demigod (who can do no wrong and whose words are gospel) 3/?

and anyone who dares question him can only be the heathen fanatic followers of a false god 4/4
