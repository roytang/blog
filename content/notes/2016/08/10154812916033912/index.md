Something I've been wondering about, maybe someone can enlighten me: if as some people claim, Marcos Sr is already entitled to be buried sa LNMB, what has stopped him from being buried there before?   Bakit kailangan pa iutos ng presidente? Meron bang discretion ang executive branch to allow or deny that privelege?   Kasi even if you say that past administrations were not friendly enough to the Marcos family, if totoo that the rules entitled them to that privelege, bakit hindi sila nagfile ng kaso against whomever was preventing it?
