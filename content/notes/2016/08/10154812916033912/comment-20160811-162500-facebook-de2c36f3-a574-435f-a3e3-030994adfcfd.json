Cory's admin legally opposed Marcos' burial anywhere in the Philippines and won on the ground that it would create disunity.<br/>Manglapus was the foreign secretary; he was the one sued by the Marcos family because you can't sue the President, but you can sue his cabinet, and he was the cabinet member who enforced President Cory's directive to disallow the homecoming of Marcos' corpse.",
