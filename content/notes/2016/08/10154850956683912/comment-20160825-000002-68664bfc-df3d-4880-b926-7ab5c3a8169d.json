Aaron\u2019s Rod Becomes a Serpent          8Now the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 9\u201cWhen Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, \u2018Work a miracle,\u2019 then you shall say to Aaron, \u2018Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, that it may become a serpent.\u2019\u201d 10So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and thus they did just as the LORD had commanded; and Aaron threw his staff down before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent. 11Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers, and they also, the magicians of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts. 12For each one threw down his staff and they turned into serpents. But Aaron\u2019s staff swallowed up their staffs. 13Yet Pharaoh\u2019s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to them, as the LORD had said.",
