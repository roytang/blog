#### Posted on r/ipad: [How good is the iPad Pro + Apple Pencil for drawing purposes?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/4vzgts/how_good_is_the_ipad_pro_apple_pencil_for_drawing/)

 I currently have the 4th generation iPad (the first one with retina display), and I've tried using third-party styluses with them but am never satisfied, it always feel imprecise. I've tried drawing with just my fingers and while it's more precise it also feels a bit more tiring

I'm thinking of getting an iPad Pro next month. How much better would it be to use the Apple Pencil?
