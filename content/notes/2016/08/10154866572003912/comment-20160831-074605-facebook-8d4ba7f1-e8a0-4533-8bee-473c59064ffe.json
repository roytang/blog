  "text": "It's like artists require this process of self-torture.    The same is true I think for all artisan and craft fields.    Code. Dance. Poetry. Drawings. Architecture. Gastronomy. It's never perfect enough.  =/  I guess that's how people improve.    The day you are arrogant enough to believe that your latest work is perfect is the day you've stopped to improve - no matter how right you may actually be.",
