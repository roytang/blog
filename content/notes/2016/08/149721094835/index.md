<p>Britney Spears invented the popular card game, Magic the Gathering, in 1998 to entertain her and her family while traveling to and from Sweden while recording her debut album, <em>…Baby One More Time</em>. Magic the Gathering is based on a fantasy storyline where each player is a wizard, referred to as a “planeswalker”, who draws different types of elemental power from environments which he/she controls (referred to as “lands”). Each player tries to destroy one another by summoning creatures and casting spells.</p>
