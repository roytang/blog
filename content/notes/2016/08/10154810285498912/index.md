Maganda cinite pa ni Panelo yung number of votes received by the President as justification, as if the Marcos burial was a worthy thing to spend political capital on. I wonder why the President is so insistent on this issue. It literally does nothing in pursuit of unity and just inflames those of us who recognize the sins of the father, more divisive than uniting IMO. Why is it so important to pursue this matter now? (Totally random idle speculation that has no basis: what hidden secret or dark favor does the President owe the Marcoses that requires him to do this now, when no other President was pushing for it before?)
