Just watched the series finale of Star Trek Voyager, finally those crazy nerds managed to get home! I came into the series with low expectations given its reputation, but I think it was pretty ok overall. There were some pretty ridiculous episodes here and there, but even the much-revered TNG suffered from that. Janeway made some questionable decisions throughout the series, but arguably they were faced with a different set of quandaries than the crew of TNG or DS9. I feel like Voyager also had way more time travel episodes than either TNG or DS9 for some reason.  Best character: The Doctor, although he's kind of a deus-ex-machina too, especially once he gets that mobile emitter "Oh, don't worry I can do that super dangerous thing because I'm a hologram!". Seven of Nine a close second, I was mildly annoyed with the character as first introduced, but she was developed well as the series went along.  Worst character: Chakotay. Ugh, I cringe whenever there's one of his "Space Indian" episodes. He didn't even do anything in the series finale except be a love interest for Seven of Nine
