  "text": "See, it's extra-terrible with real data--because even in Davao, where death squad justice has been the law of the land for years, they're *Still* finding druggies to kill, which means the policy sucks (as in their accuracy is far worse than in this thought experiment), or that they're now getting many more false positives than before.   Well, I guess math-wise, there's the silly possibility that they've reached a steady-state where the rate of kills==the rate at which non-druggies become druggies (whether users or dealers).  I mean, it seems like all it takes to get on \"the list\" is to have a neighbor who doesn't like you inform on you to a barangay tanod.",
