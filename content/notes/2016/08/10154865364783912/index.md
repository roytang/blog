[Michael](https://www.facebook.com/mdvsamson) pakicheck nga ang math nito haha. Parang malabo sakin yung relevance ng unang assumption sa 2nd paragraph nya, and doesn't it contradict the second assumption?

In any case, the more fun thing I learned here is that the DDB's own website with an estimate of 1.3M drug addicts as of 2012 contradicts the president's claim that there are 3.7M drug addicts haha

[A fun problem in statistics]

According to the Office of the President's Dangerous Drug Board, it is estimated that there are 1.3 million drug users in the Philippines[1]. Our current population is 102,250,133[2], which means around 1.27% of Filipinos are drug users. 
Let's say our government can identify if a drug user is actually a drug user 100% of the time. Let's also say that they can identify if a civilian is innocent 99% of the time (which is very generous).

a) If I get a citizen who is believed to be a drug dealer and kill him, what is the probability that he/she was innocent?

b) If 2000 people have been killed, around how many were innocent?

Answers:

a) 43.7%

b) 874 innocent people
