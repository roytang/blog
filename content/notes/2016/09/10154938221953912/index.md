Wait, so in spite of the crackdown and the violence, the drug prevalence is actually still increasing? This despite the PNP chief and the palace's statements saying the drug war was succeeding?

(I still haven't seen any independent confirmation of where the original 3.7M estimate came from though...)

Quoting the [Philippine Star](https://www.facebook.com/PhilippineSTAR/)'s [post](https://www.facebook.com/PhilippineSTAR/posts/677533695733648):

> President Duterte said that the number of drug addicts in the country is expected to soar from 3.7 million to four million by the end of the month.
