  "text": "Sorry but if I am not mistaken it works the other way around, hindi quota. You are expected to reduce incidence of crime in your area, so what police did in previous administration is not to make records of crimes in order to lower the numbers and make it appear that index crime was being lowered y-o-y.<br/>And the sacking incident in Iloilo is another matter entirely, gross negligemce of duty if I am not mistaken cause the drug related activities of mayor over swveral years were not caught despite having chance to do so from 24-hour police detail or something like that.",
