Attended the Kaladesh prerelease at Neutral Grounds Eton Centris. It turns out I was bad at Kaladesh limited and finished 1-3. I found vehicles to be challenging to fight, especially if you are low on instant-speed removal. "They're like more annoying equipment," I said, because at least with equipment when a new creature you would need to pay the equip cost and wait a turn before they attack. With vehicles, every new creature comes with a new attack!

Added photos of the prerelease box and inserts for posterity. I think it also came with a papercraft thopter that had to be assembled, which has since been lost to time.
