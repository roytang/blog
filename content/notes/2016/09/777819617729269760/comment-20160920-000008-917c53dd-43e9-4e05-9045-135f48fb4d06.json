  "text": "Yes, the writ of habeas corpus is a remedy promulgated by the SC.  The SC promulgating rules?  In this case, yes, because the SC is mandated to protect constitutional rights.    And according to the bill of rights, no person may be deprived of liberty without due process of law.  That is a right, a constitutional one at that, with a corresponding duty to forebear on the person who wants to detain you without due process.  It is most definitely not a privilege.    The writ of habeas corpus is the protection against arbitrary arrests, unlawful detention, and deprivation of liberty when there is no right to so deprive that liberty.",
