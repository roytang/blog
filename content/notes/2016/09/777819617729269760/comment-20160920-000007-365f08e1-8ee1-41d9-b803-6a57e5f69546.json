        "text": "Right sya pre.  The consti guarantees that you cannot be arrested and detained if there is no due process.  Usually that means that the officer must have an arrest warrant, or he caught you in the act, or has acceptable probable cause to believe you are connected to the crime.  If he does not have any of that, he cannot arrest you, he cannot detain you.    Assuming you are already arrested, a case against you must be filed within a certain amount of time, hours lang yan depending on the crime, or 3 days if you are suspected of committing a terrorist act.  If no case is filed against you within that time period, your detention now becomes unlawful, and you can file for habeas corpus, to ask the judge to command your arresting or detaining officer to bring you to court and explain why you are being detained.",
