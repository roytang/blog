  This is not about politics.  I do not care whether you are for or against Sen. De Lima.  I do not care whether or not you think Sen. Cayetano is correct to initiate her ouster from  the chairmanship of the committee on justice, and proclaim that our progress in the area of peace and order "is like Singapore".  I do not even care whether you are pro or anti-Duterte.  I myself am pro-Miriam, and you know she's BFFs with Duterte.

 <p>
  This is not about your personal politics at all, or the politicians you have the right to choose to support.  If you think this is about that, you've already missed the point and you should stop reading this now.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is about whether or not you support murder.

   That's right, I called it.  You don't agree with the terms "extra-judicial

  or "summary executions"?  You think the use of those words ruins the Philippines' image and reputation?  Fine, I stipulate not to use them in this rant.  But let's call it what it unquestionably is: murder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing a suspect who is surrendering?  Murder.  They're criminals anyway?  Not without a court conviction, but even then, still murder.  Multiple men with guns, aid of armed men, murder.  Guns against an unarmed suspect?  Abuse of superior strength, murder.  Killing a person and then mutilating him and taping him up to look like a pig, complete with a signage of his alleged crime?  Homicide qualified by scoffing at the corpse, aka murder.  Using a grenade to annihilate a room full of drug suspects?  Homicide by means of explosion, evil bloody murder.  Going into someone's home with the idea of shooting instead of arresting him?  Evident premeditation and murder.  Killing a person who is already handcuffed and/or subdued in custody?  Treachery and oh-my-God, MURDER.
 </p>
 <p>
  Murder is malum in se.  It is wrong the world over.  No law needs to define it because every civilized person understands it is inherently wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  I encourage everyone to support the war against drugs.  I agree with the President, we should rid our communities of this menace.  And we should reform those who can be saved.  But please, let's do it the right way.  As a member of the legal profession, I am sorry for- and equally as frustrated as you- with the slow pace of our justice system.

  like your grief and anger, however, do not justify murder.  Nothing does.

 <p>
  To paraphrase an old classmate:  One day I will meet my maker.  So will you.  And when that day comes when I have to stand before Him and explain what I did with my life and bear His judgment, I am afraid I will not be able to look Him in the eye and say that I did not know that the peace and prosperity I enjoyed was built on murder.
 </p>
 <p>
  Even if He didn't know everything, and despite my confidence in my legal strategy, I don't think I'm that good of a lawyer- nor will I ever become a good enough lawyer- to convince my God of my innocence.
