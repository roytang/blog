One of the things that made  Sen. Miriam Defensor Santiago  popular internationally  is her outspokenness. Her flamboyant personality has allowed her to make comments on issues that other politicians would otherwise leave unnoticed, fearing the power of those who are corrupt. Throughout her time in the Philippine Senate, Miriam has become well-known for voicing out her concerns for the things that she sees are not right and lawful. In many hearings and proceedings, Miriam has always opened up issues that other senators could not; her strong demeanor has allowed her to bring forth answers that have been significant in the results of the hearings.One of the things that made  Sen.
