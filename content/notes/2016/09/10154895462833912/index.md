Lol, Ok sana yung kinukutya ang accuracy ng media kasi dapat talaga nirerequire natin na maging accurate sila, pero sana naman maging accurate din yung pagkutya, otherwise lokohan lang e. 

For example, magkaibang event ang tinutukoy nyang dalawang article below. The Washington Post video was posted on Sep 8 and Obama was referring to the gala dinner on the night before (Sep 7). The ABSCBN article was posted on Sep 9 and referring to the east asia summit on Sep 8. The ABSCBN article itself says na nag shake hands sila nung gala dinner

Of course, that doesn't matter sa mga fanatic followers netong si Mocha Uson, they never let the facts get in the way of their hero worship

Edit: BTW, eto yung link to the WaPo article so you can see for yourself the date: https://www.washingtonpost.com/.../6d3fb8b6-75a9-11e6... (The ABS-CBN article's date is on the image below)

Even if agree kayo sakin, it doesn't hurt to verify I'm not BSing you either ðŸ˜›
