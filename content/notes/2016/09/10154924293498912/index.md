Regardless of our good or bad feelings towards Duterte, I think we could agree that there should be an investigation into the spate of unexplained murders and extrajudicial killings of fellow citizens.

Who are these people? Why did they end up dead? Who killed them? Who should be held accountable? How do we end the bloodbath?
