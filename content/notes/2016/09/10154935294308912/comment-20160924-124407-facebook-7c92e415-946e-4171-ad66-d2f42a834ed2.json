  "text": "There\n is the jus sanguinis thingie in the 4th article of the consti. However,\n that just defines who can call themselves Pilipino, not what it means \nto be one.  There is also history. Our mixed heritage due to 300\n years of Spanish rule that mostly erased the pre-colonial heritage, 45 \nyears of US rule (officially), and 3 years of Japanese rule is yet \nanother factor.  Our long held beliefs that we are an immutably hospitable, long-suffering, industrious, family-centered,\n resilient, brave, and noble race also comes into play. We also have our\n negatives: love of short term (shortcut) solutions, our racism, our \nextreme sense of humor, etc.  There are Pilipinos who love \npersonalities more than they love the Philippines. There are still some \nwho will be willing to sacrifice love of country over some things they \nperceive as more important. I also know of Pinoy expats who tell their \nchildren to stay away from Pilipino FOBs. On the other end of the \nspectrum, there are some expats who still love this country with a \npassion.  There are foreigners who are more Pilipino than some \nof our own. I have known of Americans who would love to retire here, and\n still some who cried over what is happening here.   Are they to be called  Pilipinos? At what point do they become Pilipinos?  I've been ruminating on this. I'm not sure if I would agree completely with Maoi.  I think it is more than love for country. I think there is more to it.   Understanding what that is will probably explain why we as Pilipinos act like how we do today.",
