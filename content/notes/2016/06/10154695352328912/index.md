Basically: misguided electorate led to their doom by lies and propaganda. There's also been a hint of anti-intellectualism at play with some of the pro-Leave side claiming that Britain "has had enough of experts" Seems to be a trend lately. If the trend holds we'll also see Trump winning the US presidency later this year

  So let's take stock:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Nigel Farage starts the morning by retracting the £350 million claim
  <br/>
  2. Daniel Hannan retracts the claim that leaving EU will reduce immigration
  <br/>
  3. £100 billion wiped off the pensions, ISAs etc. invested in the FTSE
  <br/>
  4. The pound suffers the largest currency depreciation of any currency ever
  <br/>
  5. The Prime Minister resigns without mapping out a plan for implementing the results of the referendum
 </p>
 <p>
  If I were a Leave voter, I would not be celebrating this morning. Sure, things might stabilise in time, but the immediate aftermath of the vote is admission that they'd been lied to &amp; financial meltdown on a scale even pessimists did not predict. We Remainers may be in despair, but the Leavers ought to be fucking livid.
 </p>
 <p>
  EDIT:
  <br/>
  6. The biggest share price losses were Wimpy Taylor &amp; Barclay Homes, at ~40%, which means the markets are expecting a housing crash
  <br/>
  7. Apparently the pound's value dropping so much means that the UK is no longer the 5th largest economy in the world - in a nicely symbolic move, we've been overtaken by France
