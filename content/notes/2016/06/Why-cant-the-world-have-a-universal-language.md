Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Why doesn't the entire world just use ONE language?](https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-world-have-a-universal-language/answer/Roy-Tang)


It would be a large and costly endeavor. Think about the cost involved to rewrite things like official documentation, street signs, that sort of thing. For many people it would also involve a lot of effort for very little gain. Older people especially wouldn’t take too well to having to learn a new language. People who don’t really need to communicate with people outside their local sphere of influence won’t have a great need of it.

Sure, it would be good, but it’s largely unnecessary. Right now the people who need to communicate with foreigners on a regular basis already use English as a lingua franca for their business. The other big affected market would be tourists, and some even enjoy the idea of going to a place where people speak a different language.

Lastly, take a look at current events around the world. We can’t even get people to agree on how to treat other people, how to end conflicts, which religion to follow, etc. We are a ways off from being modern enough as a species to be able to unify around a single language!
