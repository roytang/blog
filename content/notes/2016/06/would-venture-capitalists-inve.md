Thousands, maybe millions, of people know how to code. Anyone can have a killer idea. I literally had two of them right before going to bed last night.

Therefore, there is a nontrivial number of people who both know how to code and have at least one killer idea. Many of them will be way be more experienced than a 16-year old kid and will have a better idea of how the world works and will have better reputations and will be more likely to have contacts who can hook them up to VCs.

If you are a 16-year old kid who knows how to code and has a killer idea, the best way to attract a VCâ€™s attention is: implement your idea already. Start to finish, top to bottom. Prototype, iterate, then release it. Gather users, build a following. Be so big you become impossible to ignore.
