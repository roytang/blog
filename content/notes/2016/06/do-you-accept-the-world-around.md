<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">On the one hand, the world doesn’t care if you accept it or not. It is what it is, whether you accept it or not.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">On the other hand, this doesn’t mean we should settle for what the world is. It shouldn’t stop us trying to improve the current state, in whatever small way we can.</p></span>
