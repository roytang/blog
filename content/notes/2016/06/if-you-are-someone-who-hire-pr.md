Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [If you are someone who hire programmers, what is more important for you: the personality of a candidate or the technology stack he is familiar with?](https://www.quora.com/If-you-are-someone-who-hire-programmers-what-is-more-important-for-you-the-personality-of-a-candidate-or-the-technology-stack-he-is-familiar-with/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The technology stack certainly isn’t very relevant unless you are hiring for a position where you cannot avoid the additional spin-up time of someone having to pick up your technology stack. For very good developers, the spin-up time will be very low, on the order of 1–2 days or maybe a matter of hours, so it’s unlikely that the technology stack is super relevant.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The two things to look out for are personality (whether the person can work well with your culture or with a team; whether he can communicate well; whether he can be trusted to work independently with minimal guidance; etc) and general technical skill (how easy it is for him to pick up new technologies, assess technical options, etc.). Both of these can be difficult to interview for though</p></span>
