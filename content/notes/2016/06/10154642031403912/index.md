Okay, the ending was a bit weak for me but now that I've caught up, Gotham had a great season 2! Ranking now changed: Gotham > Shield/Flash > LoT > Arrow haha  The show has greatly improved since they moved away from the villain-of-the-week format and went for longer story arcs, and lots more comic book references too! The only story arc I wasn't too happy about was the Penguin family stuff, but it didn't matter too much so that's fine. Looking forward to Season 3!
