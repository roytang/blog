Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [If you lost everything and had to start over from scratch, how would you do it?](https://www.quora.com/If-you-lost-everything-and-had-to-start-over-from-scratch-how-would-you-do-it/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Even if I lost everything today, I’d still have my own confidence and skill sets to fall back on. So I’d probably still be able to find a job, maybe even freelance or something. If I need housing, I’d probably look for a friend to put me up temporarily while I look for a place. I’m very low maintenance so I can survive on a small amount of resources until I can save up</p></span>
