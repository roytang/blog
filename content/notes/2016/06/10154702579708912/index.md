People with HP printers: I need some advice. There's a problem with the black ink cartridge (see image), color seems fine. Madami pa naman ung ink. I tried align and also clean ink cartridges from the HP software ganun pa din. I also tried taking out the cartridge and manually cleaning near the nozzle (may instructions sa support page) What else can I do? Kaka two months pa lang nun printer :(

Edit: Daming typo :p
