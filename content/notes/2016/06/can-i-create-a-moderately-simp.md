Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Can I create a moderately simple back-end for the application / web site without knowing programming?](https://www.quora.com/Can-I-create-a-moderately-simple-back-end-for-the-application-web-site-without-knowing-programming/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It depends on what you mean by “moderately simple” and “without knowing programming”. If you only need to be build a simple CRUD website with no special logic of any sort, some frameworks such as RoR or Django have code generators that can automate all of that for you, but you have to provide the data structure first, which you’ll need to write in code, so it involves a “little” programming. If even that is too much for you, you can build some simple forms using online tools similar to Google Forms to capture input from users.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Anything more complicated than simple forms to capture data will probably require programming</p></span>
