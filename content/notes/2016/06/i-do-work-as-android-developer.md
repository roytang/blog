Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [I do work as Android developer and most of the time I use a lot of code from the stackoverflow or open source Apis is it normal for a dev to do so?](https://www.quora.com/I-do-work-as-Android-developer-and-most-of-the-time-I-use-a-lot-of-code-from-the-stackoverflow-or-open-source-Apis-is-it-normal-for-a-dev-to-do-so/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">As long as you understand what the code you’re copying is doing and how it applies to your needs there should be no issue. This is something perfectly normal and most devs will do it. The internet is pretty much one of the most important tools for the modern-day developer</p></span>
