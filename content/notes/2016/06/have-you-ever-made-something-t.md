Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Have you ever made something that you ultimately regret making? Why?](https://www.quora.com/Have-you-ever-made-something-that-you-ultimately-regret-making-Why/answer/Roy-Tang)


I thought about answering this with some of the products I helped develop in the past, but as I was writing it I realized that “regret” was the wrong word to choose. There were a lot of mistakes made during design and implementation that ultimately led to the failure of those products, and I suppose the company might regret spending time and effort and money on those products, but for me personally I learned a lot from them, especially on what kind of mistakes to avoid in the future

I think the only way I could say I regret making a product would be if it were something that ultimately turned out to be harmful to other people, i.e. something that might have caused injury or harm
