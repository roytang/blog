I spent 3 months in London last year for work, and one of the things I noted was that the people I worked with were a very diverse lot. At more than a few meetings there were a number of different races and accents represented with nary a hint of racist undertones, so all of these reports of casual racism coming out of Britain after the Brexit vote are just sad

As these seem like incidents we should all be aware of I've made an album for them.
