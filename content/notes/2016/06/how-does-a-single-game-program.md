<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The options should be fairly obvious:</p><ol><li>You raise money; or</li><li>You con one of your friends or some stranger to do the art for you either for free or in exchange for some part of future profits (which are unlikely to happen); or</li><li>You do the art yourself</li></ol></span>
