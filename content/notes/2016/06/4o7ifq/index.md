#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Question about Flashpoint and Rebirth](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/4o7ifq/question_about_flashpoint_and_rebirth/)

So, the current surviving Clark Kent/Superman is supposedly pre-Flashpoint Superman, and New 52 Superman is dead right?

But Pre-Flashpoint Wally West coming out of the speed force and restoring New 52 Barry's memories implies that New 52 Barry is the same as Pre-Flashpoint Barry. Shouldn't this also mean that New 52 Superman should be the same Superman from Pre-Flashpoint? Is this discrepancy something that's been explained somewhere? Or we just accept that Barry and Superman transitioned differently and handwave it away. "Comics, everbody!"
