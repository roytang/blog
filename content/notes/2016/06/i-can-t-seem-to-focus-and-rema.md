<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Despite what many might say, people can change. That is, people’s interests and passions can change. It’s not right or wrong, it’s just being human. The key is to keep living your life proactively. If you feel like the passion in your work is waning, think of what used to excite you about it and see if you can recapture that excitement. Or try to identify whether the problem is with the work you’re doing or the company you’re working for. Perhaps working for a different company or in a different environment might reingite the spark. Explore your options.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">At the same time, explore your options in other areas as well. It’s good that you tried taking courses about something, but if you find it doesn’t hold your interest very well, don’t be afraid to try other things. Be open to new opportunities or new areas to expand your character or your interests.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Living life is pretty much a game of exploration. You try things out and see if they make you happy, then you keep doing those that make you happy until they don’t. Then either you try to make it better or you search for other things to make you happy.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span>
