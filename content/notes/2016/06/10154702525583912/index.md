I was re-watching the GOT finale...  ...and near the end of the episode, Jon Snow had assembled an army, then he did something evil to summon an ancient dragon god. And Bran was shouting at him "JON WHAT HAVE YOU DONE" but Jon was shaking his head "It's done!" And it was really loud, with lightning and thunder all over (it turns out I was hearing the rain in real life), and the dragon god was huge, like a building, it descended from the split heavens and it looked like Bahamut from Final Fantasy. As it descended it was chanting YOU HAVE LOST TO YOUR DOOM...  ...then I woke up!
