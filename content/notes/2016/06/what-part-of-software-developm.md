<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Most common is burnout due to inordinate amounts of stress. It’s usually the schedule pressure + some form of bad management.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Some things that can stress software developers out:</p><ul><li>poor team dynamics</li><li>having to work too many hours</li><li>crisis-driven development</li><li>having to do substandard/low-quality work</li><li>incompetent managers not listening to developers or not respecting estimates</li><li>having to deal with constantly changing client requirements</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">All of the above are part and parcel of “enterprisey” software development though, but combined with intensive schedule pressure it can make developers question the industry altogether</p></span>
