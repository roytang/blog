First 30 minutes of Sony at #E3: "The conference is about to start in a few minutes!"

Sony #e3 conf opening with an extravagant orchestra. This is a waste of time!

FF15 has VR! #PlaystationE3

my problem with VR in general is that I'm not really a first-person kind of guy #PlayStationE3

I do not dig white-logo Spider-man #PlayStationE3

My moonshot hope for #PlayStationE3 is backwards compatibility with all PS platforms via software emu. Not gonna happen though

Just game after game for #PlayStationE3 Nothing too exciting for me, but I appreciate the format

Also, no Vita love [@PlayStation](https://twitter.com/PlayStation/)? Not even a little? D: #PlayStationE3
