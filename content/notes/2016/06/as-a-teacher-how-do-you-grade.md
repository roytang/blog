Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [As a teacher, how do you grade an hand-written programming exam?](https://www.quora.com/As-a-teacher-how-do-you-grade-an-hand-written-programming-exam/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">As a computer science teacher, you really shouldn’t give this kind of an exam. It’s in no way reflective of how code is written in the real world</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you must have an exam of this sort, you should focus on making sure the algorithm used in the code is conceptually correct, and disregard any problems in syntax that may fail a compiler. In fact, it’s probably better to have the students submit their answers in some sort of pseudocode or other informal format instead of actual program code, so they know not to focus on syntax</p></span>
