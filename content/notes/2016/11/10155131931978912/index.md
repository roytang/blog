“The human rights (defenders) said I ordered the killings. I told them ‘OK. Let’s stop. We’ll let them (drug users) multiply so that when it’s harvest time, more people will die,” the President said at the inaugural switch-on of a coal-fired power plant. “I will include you because you are the reason why their numbers swell,” he said in Filipino.

Ok, even if we use our creative imagination and assume he just means HR defenders will be among the victims when drug users multiply, the above still betrays his thinking that "no killings = drug users will multiply" and that killings are the only way to stop them from proliferating. Do you agree, mga ka-DDS?
