        "text": "Ah, you might be right. I stand corrected. From Wikipedia:    While such National Pantheon was never established during Quirino's lifetime,[9] several decrees and laws passed under succeeding administrations  led to the eventual use of the Republic Memorial Cemetery as a national pantheon described in Republic Act 289.    On 27 October 1954, President Ramon Magsaysay renamed the Republic Memorial Cemetery as the Libingan ng mga Bayani.[5] On 28 May 1967, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Presidential Proclamation No. 208 ordering the reservation of 142 hectares of land within Fort Bonifacio in consideration for the Libingan to serve not only as a cemetery for military personnel but also as a national shrine for fallen heroes. He ordered it placed under the administration of the Military Shrines Services of the Philippine Veterans Affairs Office, an agency under the Department of National Defense.[5][10]",

What the photos showed was no simple soldier's burial rites. Pati sa ganun bagay, sinungaling at manloloko. At this point, we should already expect all the worst from this family. Wala talang konsyensya. Bakit ba nagugulat pa tayo sa kasamaan na pinapakita?",
