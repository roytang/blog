  "text": "Hmm, it sounded very different in the video. the two comments weren't related. The last statement was referring to the list of govt officials involved in drug trade. He was talking about amount of proof required by law to start an investigation. The first one is another topic altogether. But I agree that reading the article makes his lumped-together statements sound abhorrent.",
