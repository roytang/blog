INJUSTICE SECRETARY IGNORES BIGGEST FISH

Secretary Aguirre is a small-time thinker. He said De Lima is the common denominator in the killings of Espinosa, a Cebu cop, and drug lord Tony Co inside Bilibid.

If he looked at the broader pattern, there is a much bigger common denominator across 1000+ Davao unresolved killings, 4700+ drug-related killings since May 2016, A bigger fish that should be reeled in by the long hook-and-line of justice.

Q: Who has the motive?

A: The guy who keeps saying "Obosen para matapos na" on the pretext of protecting future generations from drugs

Q: Who has the means?

A: The guy who controls the security services - specifically PNP - which is led by hand-picked appointee familiar with Davao Death Squad tactics

Q: Who has the track record?

A: 1000+ unresolved killings in Davao

Now let's zoom specifically into the case of Mayor Espinosa.

Q: Who has the motive?

A1: The Official Theory: The guys implicated in Espinosa's supposed affidavit - generals, politicians, senator. 

But who made the affidavit? The mayor's brother - Ramon - said “I asked my brother, ‘Did you really make the affidavit?’ And he told me, the affidavit was ready-made. It was prepared by someone else, and I was just asked to affix my signature on it.” Seems like a worthless list prepared to fit prior narratives of political witch-hunt & faulty Drug Matrix. Fabricated evidence.

A2: The Alternative Theory: One guy already openly admitted in his Oct 4 speech in Makati that he had ordered the killing of Espinosa due to drug links but Espinosa cheated death by surrendering to PNP that time: 

“Talagang order ko sa kanya, patayin mo. As in patayin mo. May isa akong team na, sa Army, sabi ko, patayin ninyo, wherever he is. Sa harap ng simbahan, patayin mo, lalo na sa cemetery, kasi mas malapit na lang itulak mo na ang putang ina niya."

Only in the Philippines would PNP and DOJ officials not consider as prime suspect the one guy who openly bragged about giving the order to kill. 

Q: Who has the means?

A: Only someone sufficiently high up the chain of command can give orders to barge into jail, overpower other PNP officers guarding the jail, shoot in-mates, and feel they can get away with it - because they control other levers of justice such as investigators, lawyers, judges. And if things go wrong, there is always that guarantee of "full pardon, with promotion to boot" in the back pocket. Only one person can inspire such impunity with a guarantee of immunity. 

Secretary Aguirre should stop chasing sardines. There is much bigger fish to fry.
