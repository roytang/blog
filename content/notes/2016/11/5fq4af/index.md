#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Many times it's a struggle between (a) trying to reach out to and understand people who hold different views; and (b) holding back because you don't feel like you can have a productive conversation with such people, especially online. How can we breach the divide?](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/5fq4af/many_times_its_a_struggle_between_a_trying_to/)

Edit: By "breach the divide", I don't really mean persuading others that you are correct, more like trying to find common ground and to learn from each other. At the very least we should be able to agree on certain things like the need to verify information and not simply believe everything we read on the internet or to be respectful to others that hold different opinions, but it seems many people aren't even open to that. It's just frustrating sometimes.
