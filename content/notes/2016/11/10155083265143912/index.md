Political horse trading is not one of the things that would change apparently

It was in 2011 when Binay offered military honors for Marcos in Ilocos [1], but the Marcoses refused this because they want FM buried in LNMB [2]. Why Binay? Because Aquino appointed the then VP to resolve this. Reasons? Nothing spelled out, but hinted as to avoid "conflict of interest" because of his Aquino name. [1] Binay still offered the same to BBM when he wanted BBM to be his runningmate. [2]

MDS, the chosen BBM runningmate, initially declared agreement for LNMB burial [3] but changed her mind in early 2016 (her mind could have changed late 2015, but only announced to media early 2016). She wanted a referendum (a poll for a political decision, like how UK voted for Brexit). She'll let the nation decide. [4]

Now, you won't be surprised why Digong suddenly ran Nov 2015 [5]. Imee donated money thru Antonio Floirendo Jr (his biggest donor, 75M to Duterte, 25M to PDP-Laban which has no senatorial slate) [6]. Floirendo campaigned for Duterte-BBM and was one of the main movers for the campaign. [10]

Duterte had a slip when he announced in his speech during an LGU event for peace governance that Imee was his donor. [6,7,9] Imee denied this because she was not in his SOCE. [8]

He gave a cute anecdote during the said speech about Imee borrowing money. [9] Neglecting the fact that the first couple's 1965 net worth was 120k pesos but became 5B dollars by 1986. Yes, hundred thousand pesos to billion dollars. [11] If invested with 10% interest compounded in 30 years, the family is richer than Bill Gates this 2016 with their net worth of $85B. Bill Gates only at $82B. So, duh. [12]

Floirendo Sr. is a banana magnate crony of Marcos. In 1987, banana magnate Antonio Floirendo entered into a compromise deal with the PCGG and turned over P70 million ($1.5 million) in cash and assets. The Marcos assets he gave to the PCGG included the Lindenmere Estate and Olympic Towers in New York and the real property listed as 2443 Makiki Heights Drive, Honolulu, Hawaii. [13]

When Duterte ran, it was a campaign promise to bury FM in LNMB. It was his promise to the Marcoses and to Ilocos on February 2016. [14] He never denied close ties with the Marcoses, as "BBM as a friend" even became his reason for initially not appointing Leni in his cabinet. [15]

The Marcoses are schemers and guess who's their winning puppet? It is ALL ON DUTERTE, not the Aquinos nor any politician of the past.

*My brother roughly estimated the 2016 Marcos net worth.

PS: I am not pro-Aquino nor am I anti-Duterte. I am pro-Philippines and Anti-FMtheDicta torMurdererPlun derer. I just can't settle with how Anti-Marcos Pro-Duterte guys deflect the blame from Duterte. It is okay to be Anti-Marcos and be Pro-Duterte. But accept the situation as it is. Do not whitewash.
