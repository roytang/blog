I rarely do the passive-aggressive status updates, but I'm just so pissed off.   If you don't believe in what people are fighting for today, fine, whatever, you have a right to remain ignorant. But maybe consider just shutting up instead of insinuating people are being paid off when you don't know anything. Mahiya ka naman sa mga tao who would be willing to fight for your rights even when you're one of those people who doesn't give a damn.  To all my friends who are going to the rallies today, take care and stay safe and keep fighting. I am with you in spirit.
