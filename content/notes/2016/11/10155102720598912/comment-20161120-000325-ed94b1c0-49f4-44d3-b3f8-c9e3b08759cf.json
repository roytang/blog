Hence, the president, as the head of civilian power, is installed as commander in chief.    Kahit si Ramos na heneral, he is considered a civilian president, who is also, by constitutional fiat, the commander in chief.    That is a people power provision in the constitution designed to prevent military rule and to ensure that sovereign power always resides is regular citizens.",
