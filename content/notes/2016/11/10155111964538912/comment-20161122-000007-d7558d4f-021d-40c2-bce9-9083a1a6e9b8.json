Those are enemies of the state as far as I&#x27;m concerned, which the state must suppress.  What I understood were the common people on the street, who were fighting a dictatorship with nothing but their voices, stopping tanks with just their hands, singing hymns when faced with guns.    So I grew up anti-Marcos.  And hoped we would never have another leader like him again.    Kaso, magaling ako mag-compartment alize at mag-separate ng issues.  Like yung libing.

I don&#x27;t care where it&#x27;s buried, as long as it&#x27;s buried and done with.  There is no symbolism to me like the protesters today claim.  It&#x27;s a corpse.  Good riddance.    But of course, FB has to break my heart with non-sequitur comments.  Because I&#x27;m not anti-libing, and I can&#x27;t be neutral on that issue even though I don&#x27;t really care about it, then I must be pro-Marcos.  That&#x27;s the narrative, and it&#x27;s not the truth. At least, it&#x27;s not my truth.    I fight for the rule of law everyday.  I insist on due process, for former presidents, down to the suspected drug addict on the street.  I am generous with my time and advice, so that people are not taken advantage of by their government unwittingly. I hope I never live to see martial law abuses, or another oppressive regime.  But because I&#x27;m ambivalent on the libing issue, it seems like those other things don&#x27;t count.  I must be pro-Marcos; I must be pro-Marcos-era martial law.    Sorry for the hugot.  Facebook makes me sad sometimes.",

But because I can compartmentaliz e, I get why he filed an electoral protest.  Right naman nya yun.  Almost every candidate who loses a close one, and some who lose big, files a protest.    And because we are no longer under his father's regime, and the Constitution guarantees rights to everyone, I will not deny him his right to due process, even of he is a Marcos, even if his father did precisely that to our people.",

        "text": "I think I know how you feel, Wynner. You just said it much more eloquently! When I found out that Marcos was buried at LNMB, I felt like I was punched in the gut. Like you, I was in Edsa. Though I must admit, back then, I didn't really know why - basta vehemently anti-Marcos ako. That's my emotional take on it.     Pero, from a clinical perspective, the legal basis is there (siyempre, mas alam mo yun). That's why I can't argue against the burial with conviction. They're entitled to their rights, too.     But you know what? I think the Marcoses will get their karma sooner than they think. They exposed a dormant, festering wound that took us 30 years to almost forget. It's fresh again, less likely that BBM will be president in 2022.    FB makes me sad, too. What with all the generalizations  and assumptions that the other side is stupid or misinformed (one yelling \"bias!\", the other yelling \"troll!\").  \ud83d\ude25",
