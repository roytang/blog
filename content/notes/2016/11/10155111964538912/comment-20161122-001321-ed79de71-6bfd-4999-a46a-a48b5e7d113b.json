But because I can compartmentaliz e, I get why he filed an electoral protest.  Right naman nya yun.  Almost every candidate who loses a close one, and some who lose big, files a protest.    And because we are no longer under his father&#x27;s regime, and the Constitution guarantees rights to everyone, I will not deny him his right to due process, even of he is a Marcos, even if his father did precisely that to our people.",
