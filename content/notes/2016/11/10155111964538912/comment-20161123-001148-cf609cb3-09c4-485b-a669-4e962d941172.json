It can&#x27;t declare martial law, it can&#x27;t issue arrest search seizure orders, it can&#x27;t do anything corrupt, it can&#x27;t steal.  Much more now that it&#x27;s 6 feet underground.    If pushed to determine its symbolic value, well, its value to me is as the lifeless body of a dead dictator who can&#x27;t hurt me anymore.",
