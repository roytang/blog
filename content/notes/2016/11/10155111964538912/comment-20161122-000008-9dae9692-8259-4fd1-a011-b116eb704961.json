I do remember a fight between my dad (an OFW) and my mom during an election year where she volunteered for NAMFREL and was pregnant.     I was 8 during the first EDSA revolution and remember crowding around the radio listening to Radyo Veritas and wondering when the TV would go back to playing Voltes V and the other cartoons. I wasn&#x27;t allowed to go to EDSA but when we went back to school there was a hole made in the school perimeter by a tank. I wish I was there instead of at home where there was Veritas and rosary praying.",
