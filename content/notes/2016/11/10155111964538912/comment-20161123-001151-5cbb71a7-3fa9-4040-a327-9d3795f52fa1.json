I&#x27;m more worried that 30 years from now, extra-judicial killings are not just commonplace, but that Duterte has made it the norm, only then they&#x27;re being shot with AKs, coz you know, Russia.  That we&#x27;re an annex of China.  That traffic has turned the Philippines into a parking lot.  Or that Bataan turns into Chernobyl disaster and our grand kids are born with 5 eyes and 6 legs.    I guess I jus&#x27;t don&#x27;t feel strongly about what people say the burial means like you guys do.",
