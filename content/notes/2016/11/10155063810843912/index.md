'There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that "my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge."' 

-- Isaac Asimov, Column in Newsweek (21 January 1980)  (not really just a US thing)
