  "text": "Thank for your question! First, all artist reveal their soul through their art, not only in the art itself, but even in what they choose to depict. It\u2019s impossibly to fake your sense of life. If an artist chooses to beautifully render the corpse of a raccoon at the side of the road, rather than paint a beautiful woman, that says something about the artist, whether they intended it or not. I firmly believe that bad guys, for example, are a lot scarier if they have sound reasons for their views. People who do evil don\u2019t wake up and think \u201cI\u2019m going to do evil today.\u201d The wake up and think things like \u201cI\u2019m going to do good today and kill a prostitute.\u201d My heroes are people I look up to, so they naturally reflect my sense of life.\n\nIf your aim is to write fantasy, I can tell you that publishers love a series. That\u2019s because most fantasy readers like to read a long series. Once a series is successful, publishers don\u2019t even want to talk about anything other than more books in the series. It\u2019s a double edge sword. Some readers want to read something new, but many love the books and so they want more of them. Publishers decide what they want to buy, and they want to buy what readers think they want. Authors who want to eat write what they are told to write. Or they finish their series and write NEST, and then take it to a new publisher.\n",
