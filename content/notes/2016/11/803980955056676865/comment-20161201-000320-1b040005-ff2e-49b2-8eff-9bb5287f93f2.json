I think some people just believe what they want to believe and not realize that there are other ways of looking at the issue or that the way they are looking at the issue might not be the only way. Parang math- many people only know one way to get to a solution and aren&#x27;t open to other possible solutions.     It boils down to education (where do people get information) and addressing poverty  (kung kapit sa patalim kahit ano gagawin for the next meal- even if giving up rights or integrity). It&#x27;s going to be a long process of change.",
