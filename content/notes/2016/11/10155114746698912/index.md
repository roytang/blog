Here's something that might interest Marcos supporters. At least those with an open mind. After all, we should at least be able to agree that reviewing the reliability of your sources is a good idea right?

"Herein lies the problem with Marcos apologists: Since they have rejected verifiable sources of information, they often place themselves in a reality loop."

Here is some useful information for when Marcos supporters cite and re-post articles from Get Real Philippines.  Lisandro Claudio, a  Research Associate at the Institute of Philippine Culture, Ateneo de Manila University and an Affiliated Assistant Professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies, Kyoto University, critiques the site and user Benign0, who runs it. He says:

"I’m an open minded-guy and, despite doctoral research on the Marcos regime, I’m sure I missed out on some things. Moreover, like Benign0, I am not invested in the glorification of People Power and the Aquinos, having previously researched Cojuangco-Aquino skullduggery in Hacienda Luisita. So in the spirit of openness, I asked Benign0 for sources. 

I first asked him if he could name a single university-published, peer-reviewed book that endorses the Marcos regime, and got a non sequitur for a reply. I prodded further, asking, “So, no book?” to which he simply replied, “Nope.” (READ: Librarian to Marcos supporters: 'Read reliable sources' on martial law)

Failing to spur dialogue, I asked him for his sources on Philippine politics during the Marcos period. He remained dismissive: “What I read in my own time is my business. What I publish via GetRealPhilippines.com is all u got.” As for bothering with academic sources, Benign0 believes that “Ph history academe is a tiny community of inbred minds.”
