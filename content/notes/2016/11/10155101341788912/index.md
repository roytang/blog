What a waste of a mandate and potential political capital, to spend it on this ridiculous sideshow that is the Marcos burial. I'm at least able to understand a little bit the twisted logic behind the violent war on drugs since it is supposedly being done "for the good of the country", but this madness is obviously done all for the sake of an actual temperemental brat wanting to pay back political debts and to whitewash the record of a tyrant. The president of the country traded the dignity of this country for political support, that's how much he thinks of us.
