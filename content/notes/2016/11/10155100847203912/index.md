Quoting Jon Limjap: 

> "Whether or not you liked his son, whether or not you believed in propaganda against him, and whether or not you want to spite him by removing his name from the airport, this person died believing he was doing something good for his country. The other one? They knew people will be against it, so they had to sneak his body in to his "burial place of honor". Pwe."

  No one organized this but millions came and created the world's biggest funeral procession. No soldiers secured this. This was not kept a secret. No 21 gun salute. The body was not flown by helicopter. The family did not demand a hero's burial.
