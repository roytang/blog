  "text": "btw, may US Congress reaction sa history at some of the massacres in Mindanao.. including the fave bud dajo one if i'm not mistaken. we are not limited as a people sa court of law. the legislative can issue a resolution about most anything... from recognizing an accomplishment to condemning a person as persona non-grata.. why not ask the legislative to issue resolutions that would condemn the things not easily 'provable in the courts of law? but noooo.. we prefer to hate what we hate rather than being proactive about the things we need to effect constructively. And it is not easy mind you.. selling a good idea to the representatives of the people ay isang maselan na gawain. hahahaha.. but i'm glad some still do such, to my mind, pro-active and constructive things rather than giving unending non-constructive voice to their anger, hate, and frustration.",
