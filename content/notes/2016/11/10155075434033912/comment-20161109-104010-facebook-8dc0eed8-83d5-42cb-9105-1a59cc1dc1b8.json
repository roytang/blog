  "text": "I'm afraid I have not much faith in our legislature (collectively) either, but good luck with that. I have friends din naman who are campaigning for legislative action, which I wholly support. Not everyone has that freedom or luxury of time, but at the very least we should be voicing out our concerns. I just hope the DepEd initiative to include a more thorough coverage of Martial Law abuses in the education system is not stymied by the allies of the Marcoses",
