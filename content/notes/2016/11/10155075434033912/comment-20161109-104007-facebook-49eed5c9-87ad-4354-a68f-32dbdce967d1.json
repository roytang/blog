  "text": "\"has yet to be proven by a competent court.\"  does a hawaiian court have jurisdiction in the Pinas? it is not competent to rule on anything that can be binding under Philippine Law.  i am the last to deny there were abuses committed during ML My family has paid its share, in blood, for fight against ML. but if ML, its abuses, theft, etc is not definitively addressed, it will be reduced to hearsay.. and we are many but our resources and ambitions are limited compared to the Marcoses and their allies/cronies  the sad fact is: we as a country have not ruled anything definitively, legally, about the Marcos issue. this is the lesson we all need to learn so we do not f*ck up again because of our lazy-ass, reactive, short-sighted outlook and be in a bind whenever there is a rule of law or rule of emotion  dilemma.  i mean if educated people can dismiss everything a person says because he was less than accurate  in the past... is a symptom of the value we give to the rule of emotions in the country. lagi na lang tayo mauuto nito ng kung sino man ang nasa taas.",
