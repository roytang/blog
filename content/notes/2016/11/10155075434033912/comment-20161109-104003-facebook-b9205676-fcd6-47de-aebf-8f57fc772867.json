  "text": "Well, abuses during the martial law era are definitely proven in a legal sense, given at least one judgment by a Hawaii court awarding reparations to the victims (whether or not you consider them a competent court or not is a different matter. Certainly, whether we even have any competent courts in this country is a valid question). And would any of us here deny that any abuses happened during the Marcos regime?  As for my caption above, I was merely commenting that in a possible future, another president might as well be looking back at the current administration and mouthing similar words. 'As for the abuses committed during Duterte\u2019s N-year regime, which saw thousands of people murdered and rounded up under a bloody drug war, [unknown future president] claimed this \u201chas yet to be proven by a competent court.\u201d'",
