Last week someone asked me what "demagogue" meant so I gave an explanation. Today I thought I'd read the wikipedia article on the term: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue

The article includes a list of methods that demagogues commonly employ:

- Scapegoating
- Fearmongering
- Lying
- Emotional oratory and personal charisma
- Accusing opponents of weakness and disloyalty
- Promising the impossible
- Violence and physical intimidation
- Personal insults and ridicule
- Vulgarity and outrageous behavior
- Folksy posturing
- Gross oversimplification
- Attacking the news media

Practically all of these have become so familiar over the past year!
