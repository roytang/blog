Warcraft movie review:

- if you are not a fan of Warcraft lore, I do not recommend watching it. It's kind of a generic fantasy movie in that case, nothing too exceptional. Pwede nang cable
- if you are a fan, go watch it. You know you want to
- costumes, cgi, fight scenes fairly good. i was worried that the cgi orcs would look weird and out of place, but I actually like how they turned out
- surprisingly faithful to the original plot of the source material
- ... which leads to a piss-poor ending for anyone just wanting to watch generic fantasy movie, because of what happens to the main characters in the source material
- a lot of warcraft lore elements are introduced with minimal exposition, which would probably overwhelm a non-fan
