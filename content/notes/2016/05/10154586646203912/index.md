Change isn't coming; change is already here, and it is already for the worse. More and more people feel like it's okay to talk to other people this way, or even to threaten violence against those who disagree with their views. And they are unrepentantly proud of it too. Our leaders define the boundaries we find acceptable for society, whether they mean to or not. Forget about being a good example to children when one can't even be a good example to other adults.
