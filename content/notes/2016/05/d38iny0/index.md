If you cap out on currency sinks, you are playing the game too narrow, or your tall strategy isn't working out properly.

I'd suggest more colonization (playing 'wide') at that moment. It is not that harsh to one up the core planet limit.

Also, sectors. Use them. They are quite decent. They get some flak, yes. But they are perfectly functional (minus the obvious bugs with synths and slaves).

[14:35] I've been expanding at a reasonable rate, but I don't want to pass planets to the sectors until they're decently developed, so I need to wait a bit before I start expanding again
