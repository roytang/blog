#### Posted on r/spikes: [[Modern] jeskai control or grixis control](https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/4i42a9/modern_jeskai_control_or_grixis_control/)

So I have the option of assembling either jeskai control or grixis control. What are the differences to consider? Do they have different bad matchups? I like having lightning helix to help stabilize vs burn but I'm not sure if jeskai is better positioned than grixis atm
