#### Posted on r/spikes: [[Standard] Can anyone recommend any good Bant Company guides?](https://reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/4lepdc/standard_can_anyone_recommend_any_good_bant/)

- Main deck card choices
- Good/bad matchups
- Sideboarding choices and options
- Things to watch out for

I haven't been playing Standard since SOI came in but I just found out I'm qualified for our WMCQs so I'm planning to put together the deck (It's the standard deck I already have most of the cards for and can buy/borrow the rest), but I won't have too much time to playtest due to reasons, so I'm hoping to read up as much as I can in the next two weeks
