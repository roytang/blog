King Arthur's Excalibur, the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain, and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word \"suckers\" in it. \n\n**Mr. Burns:** Yes yes yes, so what?\n\n**Smithers:** You want your bear, Bobo, don't you? \n\n*Burns suddenly snaps and turns to Smithers* \n\n**Mr. Burns:** Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a life time! *(flails fruitlessly at Smithers, exhausting himself)* Resistance is futile! *(continues flailing before collapsing in Smither's arms)* Oh god, how I want my bear. But he's gone, I give anything to know what happened to him. ",
