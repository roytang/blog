  title: "Merlin (BBC)"
---

Finished watching all 5 seasons of the BBC Merlin show. Lots of Game of Thrones actors making an appearance lol. I like how they flipped the trope of Merlin being a wise old wizard advising Arthur, but of course the series ending was way too predictable (it can't be helped given the Arthurian legend)
