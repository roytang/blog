I understand that many people feel like they have nothing to lose and are willing to gamble on someone unconventional and anti-establishment. I understand why they are tired of incremental improvements and want to risk a bigger change. But if the mayor pushes through with his violent and authoritarian rhetoric (or even worse if he does unleash death squad justice on a national scale) we stand to lose more collectively as a society, it may push us in a direction from which it may take us generations to recover

Obviously it's a worst-case scenario. We are unable to predict the future, so there's also a good chance that I'm wrong and that he does well and he doesn't have to sacrifice democratic values to do so. And if he wins, that's what I hope will happen. 

But purely from a risk management perspective, it doesn't make sense. The variance in possible outcomes is way too high. Normally you manage the risk by putting in risk mitigation mechanisms, but the candidate himself has openly and proudly threatened to abolish or defy the institutions designed to keep the executive in check (Congress, CHR, COA) and minimize the risks associated with a potential bad president. Every time I go back and ask myself to consider supporting the man, I remember these risks and they are always unacceptable to me. I would rather we chug on at our admittedly slow and incremental pace

Well, there's nothing to be done now. There is no one left to convince apparently. The polls open in little more than two hours. Sana lang hindi magkaron ng gulo, no matter the outcome. Destiny awaits
