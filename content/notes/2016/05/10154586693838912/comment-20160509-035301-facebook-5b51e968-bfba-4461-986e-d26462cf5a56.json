  "text": "At this point we only have said candidate's words to rely on, and yet we are left dumbfounded whether he truly means half the words he says. The other half we cannot understand - and I say that as a Cebuano, Tagalog and English speaker. 30% of the population seems decided to release this havoc among all of us. An above board risk mitigation would have been to unify the 70% to defeat \"the looming scepter of dictatorship\". But alas it has proven unpopular. It would have been the cheapest, most peaceful, only democratic means to topple a dictator.",
