Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Is there a good web tutorial that teaches you how to make a complex inventory management system?](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-good-web-tutorial-that-teaches-you-how-to-make-a-complex-inventory-management-system/answer/Roy-Tang)


No. Web tutorials will only teach you the basics. Most probably you just need to learn how to implement form-based screens that do simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Your “complex inventory management system” can be built upon those basics, and most probably will have specific requirements that web tutorials can’t cover. You’ll need to learn how to do the parts of it individually and put it all together.
