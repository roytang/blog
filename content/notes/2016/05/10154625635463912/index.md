I feel like if I was younger and more trusting of state authority, there would have been a better chance of me being in favor of the death penalty. But I'm old and wise enough to know that humans are fallible creatures, and somehow placing them in power makes them even more so, and thus we should avoid giving the state too much authority over human life.  Side note: I clicked through the link and read through the comments section a bit. Big mistake, sumakit lang ulo ko sa terrible comments
