  "text": "I think it is not enough to prove that it was not a conduit. But what are the allegations Ridge? Being a conduit was not alleged. Just that there was 211M.  So why entertain a fishing expedition? Besides the affidavit alleging things is based on double hearsay? Why entertain an accusation that is prima facie devoid of credibility (because of the double hearsay and not because of the accuser)?     For me, they are playing a legal chess game. They should do this in the proper forum.",
