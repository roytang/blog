  "text": "What? Pre... i think there is a disconnect.  When BPI certifies that the commulative deposits wont amount to 211M or even close to it MEANS there is no hidden wealth.  Even if there was a wire out.  Basta importante ang total deposits...what  number is that. BPI already certifies na malinis. Besides, AMLC would get red flags right away.  And there was none.  Lets move on pre!  Next mud please!",
