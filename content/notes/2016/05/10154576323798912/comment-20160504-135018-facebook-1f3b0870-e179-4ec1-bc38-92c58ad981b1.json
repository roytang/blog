  "text": "next, the SPA circulating online is carefully and craftily worded, at no point in time is there a deposit singly or collectively 211M. this can be interpreted to mean exactly 211M in the bank, so it might be negative if the amount is +/- a few pesos. if the mayor wanted to be really transparent, he could have asked the bank to print out the transaction history and showed it to the public",
