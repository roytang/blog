I was going to post this together with the survey I just posted, but I thought it might be a good idea to separate it. This explains why I made the survey in the first place. (Link to the survey: https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/10154576312758912)

I had a discussion of with a friend of mine via PM about the general mindset of Duterte supporters about the DDS/extra judicial killings. He said this to me via PM: "my great fear is that Duterte wins, then continued prosperity + improvements in peace and order, and death squad justice gets legitimized across the country. it would change the Philippines as permanently as Marcos entrenched corruption"

I haven't posted anything about the extrajudicial killings in a while. The more rational supporters will justify their support by saying there is no proof, evidence, charges filed, etc. Or some will say the criminals were killed in self-defense or legitimate police operations (never mind the reports of people being gunned down on the street by people on motorcycles - see the link below) Davao residents I've spoken to say they sometimes hear rumors of so-and-so being killed but no proof. Of course, none of my friends living in Davao are from the slum areas, so probably they are not directly affected.

Sometimes it's not always easy to come forward against people who shoot people down in the streets. I was reading this today: https://amadopicardal.blogspot.com/2016/04/the-victims-of-davao-death-squad.html, and one of the relevant paragraphs is as follows:

> "So far, no one has been held accountable for these killings. There has been no official investigation by the police or the city government. The police do not acknowledge the existence of the DDS. The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) came to Davao for a public hearing and also met secretly with witnesses â€“ family of the victims and former members of DDS. Although the CHR recommended prosecution, this could not prosper because nobody was willing to testify in court out of fear. The DDS are still around and anybody who testifies will surely be targeted for assassination."

Other supporters are like "haha buti nga sa mga yan, mga criminal naman sila" etc. At the very least, the mindset of EJKs being an acceptable thing is being propagated among those people.

There's also the possibility that there are EJKs going on, but the authorities/the mayor are not directly involved. But even if this were true, at the very least they are unable to stop it, or they are complacent or tolerant

Personally, I don't know of course. I don't have first-hand information. But from what I've read, I do not consider it implausible. I think it is highly likely that there really are extra judicial killings going on, and I don't think they have been sufficiently explained. And I share the fear that under a Duterte presidency it could become a trend nationwide, especially with his pronouncements that he will pre-emptively pardon policemen so that they don't have to worry about human rights, etc. I don't think saying you will increase their salaries or such will be enough to avoid abuses. People with power will always be tempted to abuse that power, and policemen are only human. They should be held accountable for the power they wield.
