  "text": "Excuse me Ridge. And no disrespect.    But you sound like a Trillanes pre!   :)    Let me explain... first, Trillanes is the acuser therefore it would be absurd for Du30 to cooperate for the simple reason that the burden of proof is not Du30's.  Doing otherwise is absurd.    AND more importantly, the SPA (aka waiver) asked BPI to confirm 211M either exists both indivually or commulatively in his bank accouny.  BPI said no it does not exist!  What else do you want?    Another thing, when asked if Trillanes' attached print out is a BPI document, BPI said no.      Lastly, the source is from a friend of a friend. Lol. Double hearsay.  Pre, mas matalino tayo dyan.    Suma total:  Trillanes' claims are baseless.  If people wont believe that, I will accuse these folks of intellectual dishonesty.",
