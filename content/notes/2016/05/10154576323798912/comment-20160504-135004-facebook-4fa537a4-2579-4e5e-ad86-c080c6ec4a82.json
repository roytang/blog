  "text": "Gerard  Ok the EJKs is unverified my questiom is what about the bank accounts? If he is running on a platform against corruption wouldn't it make sense to lead the way and show he doesn't have unexplained wealth? He owes it to you supporters at least that he practices what he preach and is unafraid of scrutiny. By opening the transaction history he leads the way for transparency and its easy enough to redact the other account numbers to protect the privacy of those accounts. Its really surprising that he doesn't want to show it. It will help his avowed purpose to unify the country if he can dispel those doubts IMO.",
