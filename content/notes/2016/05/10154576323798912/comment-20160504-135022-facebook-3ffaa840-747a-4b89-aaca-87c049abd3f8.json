  "text": "Michael  As alleged by Trillanes the mayor has unexplained wealth and its reflected inside the bank accounts which at least 2 were verified as existing. It might be a fishing expedition by Trillanes but people are asking for the transaction history to debunk the allegations. As a major presidential candidate you must expect public scrutiny regardless if the bank secrecy protects you or not. By showing carefully worded SPAs and \"waivers\" showing limited info he invites questions what is he hiding about the transactions which are alleged by Trillanes. Why not voluntarily show the transaction and be done with it and run away with the presidency? If he is running on a platform of transparency then doing that will shiw he has nothing to hide and leading by example. This might even start the bank secrecy reform and flush out politicians and public servants with unexplained wealth. Thats why a lot of people are asking.",
