In addition to improving education on Martial Law history, maybe we should also seriously consider adding the following to the high school curriculum:
- basic logic and reasoning
- different types of fallacies
- how to do basic research
- how to verify whether something is true
- how to verify whether a source is reliable
- how to to identify satire and/or sarcasm
- basic concepts of statistics
- how to articulate your arguments well (I think the Eng/Fil subject in HS curriculum covers only literature and not any sort of communication skill)
- how to debate and argue without taking things personally
- basic concepts of economics
- proper usage of memes
- when it is appropriate to post spoilers

Can someone forward this to Tesdaman? Thanks! Lol
