How can I get people to like me and act less awkward?](https://www.quora.com/Im-sometimes-awkward-in-social-situations-because-my-mind-goes-blank-and-I-dont-know-what-to-say-Im-starting-a-new-job-tomorrow-How-can-I-get-people-to-like-me-and-act-less-awkward/answer/Roy-Tang)


Donâ€™t worry too much about what people think about you. Other people generally think about us a lot less often than we imagine.

Be a true person. That means being open and honest and unpretentious. It also means being comfortable with yourself, flaws and all.

Be interested in other people. Genuinely interested. When you meet someone new, try to find something you find interesting about them and ask them more about it.
