If you were hired by Amazon, they saw something in you that made them believe you would be a good hire. Nothing can take that away from you.

Look at your tasks and figure out what the problem is and try to correct.

Are you being given tasks for which you don’t have the necessary tools, skillset or knowledge? Raise it to your manager and ask whether you could be given additional time to learn the necessary tools first. Or whether there is supplemental training the company could provide.

One of the great things about working as a software developer is that we are always faced with new challenges in our chosen field. It’s never boring. You need to have that attitude of always being willing to step up to the challenge of new skills that need to be learned.
