  "text": "reasonably accurate translation. He does refer to a certain group of people(taga Manila/from Manila) who determine who our national heroes should be, who declare national holidays for these heroes as walay batasan (walang modo/no manners translation is fair enough), etc. This group of people have not the declared the first person who fought against imperialistic invaders as a national hero (who he says should be the first National Hero), no National Holidays for him.    (and here's the Bisaya humor with anti-Imperial Manila color) Do you know what these certain group of people did(to the first to fight imperialistic invaders)? They(ang mga ulol) made him a fish!!!!    Humanda sila kung ako maging Presidente(coll ective intake of breathe from imperial manila people)... magkakaroon din tayo ng Lapu-Lapu Day at National Holiday rin ito.    so no - he did not \"refer to people from Manila...\", it is being overly melodramatic to say he called all Manilenyos(peop le from Manila) as all of those.. unless it is these Manilenyos who did all that. Classic anti imperial Manila Rhetoric, man. uttered i'm guessing in Cebu.",
