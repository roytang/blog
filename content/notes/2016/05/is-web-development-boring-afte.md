Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Is web development boring after a certain amount of time doing it?](https://www.quora.com/Is-web-development-boring-after-a-certain-amount-of-time-doing-it/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Anything can become boring if you do it for too long and you let it. Whether you find something boring or not depends more on you as a person that the activity that you’re doing. Stamp collecting seems like the most boring hobby in the world, but there are people who have been doing it for ages.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Any kind of programming is in a class unto itself though, because technology advances so rapidly. There are always a lot of new things to learn!</p></span>
