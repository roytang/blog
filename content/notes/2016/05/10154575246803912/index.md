Any friends working in the education system who can give some insights as to why the martial law abuses are not highlighted in schools? 

The sad thing about this is that many of the martial law abuse victims are already quite old and Bongbong Marcos may outlive them, so even if he doesn't win in this election, he will still have more chances later on. We need to propagate more of these videos and capture the testimony of those who faced abuses so that people don't forget.
