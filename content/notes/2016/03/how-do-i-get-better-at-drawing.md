Practice, practice, practice.

Try tracing out pictures for a while. Get a sheet of paper that you can partly see through and overlay it on an existing image of a face and a body. Depending on the paper you might not be able to see much detail, but you can trace the outline and general location of the facial details and also the general body proportions.

Most artists will use outline figures, like ovals and circles and lines, to outline the general placement of body parts and proportions. There's an example of this at [How to Draw People](http://www.wikihow.com/Draw-People)

Once you have the rough outline, either from a sketch or what, you can fill out the details however you like

Try to draw first from reference images that you can see, not just ones you have in your head, it will be easier. After a lot of practice, you will be more easily able to translate the images in your head to drawings by hand.

If you use reddit, there's a subreddit I've found helpful, it's http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily, you might want to check it out.
