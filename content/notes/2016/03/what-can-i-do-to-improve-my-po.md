There's this exercise I've been trying for about a month now: <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="makeuseof.com" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/this-3-minute-exercise-will-actually-fix-your-posture/" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 20186212);" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This 3-Minute Exercise Will Actually Fix Your Posture</a></span> 

I think it's made some improvement, I don't know how much.

If your back is hurting consistently, it might be be better to consult a doctor about it.
