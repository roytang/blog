Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice Spoiler-Free Review: 

- (Edit) OK lang panoorin, wag lang magexpect na super ganda ang story. Entertaining naman mga fight scenes :p 
- not a fan of Affleck's Batman. Too gun-friendly, and he doesn't really show a Bruce Wayne persona. He's dark and brooding and grim in and out of the suit 
- Jeremy Irons as Alfred was ok, but he looks like Tony Stark 
- Eisenberg's Luthor is not the same as any of the previous Luthors. He's a manic genius, closer perhaps to the Riddler 
- a number of plot details don't really make any sense. Need to suspend disbelief quite a bit 
- Snyder is too in love with his slow-motion scenes trying to make everything dramatic 
- there are a number of sequences that don't mesh well together, like Snyder is randomly jumping between scenes that don't cohere  
- in fact, there are particular scenes that feel like "WTH is this scene for, Snyder is just indulging himself now" 
- it's like Superman needs to realise that Lois Lane is more trouble than she's worth 
- yay cameos of future JLers 
- the actual BvS showdown looked great, and went pretty much the way you'd expect 
- Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman was great 
- I liked the final battle sequence 
- many, many things pointing towards the eventual JL movie 
- IMAX? Probably not worth it. Not too much 3d stuff 
- Post-credits scene: NO. Or so the internet tells me, we didn't bother to wait  
- 
- I can see why the reviewers kind of ripped the movie apart. They definitely need to work more on tightening up the movies, but overall this was better than Man of Steel I think.
