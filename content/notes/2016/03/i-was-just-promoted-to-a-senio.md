It depends greatly on what your company associates with the title. It would be best to ask.

Some typical examples might be:</p><ul><li>code review of other developers' work</li><li>making bigger technical design/architectural decisions and analyses</li><li>mentoring of junior developers</li><li>performance evaluation of junior developers</li><li>responsibility over more projects/systems/modules</li><li>etc</li></ul></span>
