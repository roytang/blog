   Leni stood out among the VP candidates in contention during the GoNegosyo Talks: Meet the the Vice Presidentiables
  </span>
  <wbr/>
  <span class="word_break">
  </span>
  . In answering questions on MSMEs, education, employment, and even charter change, three things became clear that night:
 </p>
 <p>
  First, only Leni spoke from actual experience that grounded her approach to addressing these national concerns.
 </p>
 <p>
  Second, she takes a different course from the traditional politicians' approach. She is the only one who believes in empowering people and making government more responsive to peopleâ€™s needs - especially those in the fringes of society.
 </p>
 <p>
  And lastly, she is a strong leader that takes principled stands against answering injustices of Martial Law and misconceptions on the current CCT program.
