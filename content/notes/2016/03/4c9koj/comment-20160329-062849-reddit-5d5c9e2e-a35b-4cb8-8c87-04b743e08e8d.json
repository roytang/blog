  "text": "All societal ills that we can observe have political roots. Doing volunteer work, charity, obeying laws, and paying taxes merely perpetuate the same problems they aim to address. Give a child education through charity, for example. You might have helped the child but there remain millions of children without an education. Without acting on the political and economic roots, these societal issues will persist. What the others have mentioned do not help the country substantially.",
