Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [How big was the biggest software development team you have worked on? What were you working on?](https://www.quora.com/How-big-was-the-biggest-software-development-team-you-have-worked-on-What-were-you-working-on/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The biggest was a case management system (that's pretty generic, I know), a web application written mostly in Java, that involved a development team of some 30-40 people, of which I was the technical lead. The system was pretty large - case management consisted of a lot of different types of records and there was a significant finance component. The system included a customisable workflow engine of which I was the primary architect.</p></span>
