<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You can put 100% of your effort into something and do everything right and make no mistakes and have the right circumstances and in the end still fail. That is not your failing, that is life. That's how it works.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Life isn't deterministic. We can't predict outcomes perfectly, nor should we try to. We don't do things because we will surely succeed. We do things because we are willing to risk failure for the chance to succeed. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There will be a tendency to be disheartened, when you put your all into something and it falls apart. This is only natural. But you have to learn to accept failure, learn from the mistakes, learn how to manage the risks, and move on. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Life goes on.</p></span>
