I like that the satellite is so small. In the future, satellites will be even tinier. Like the size of a raspberry pi or maybe even less. We'd have lots of them up there, and they can link up and cooperate like a network. In the sky. And we'll call it "Network in the Sky" for short

Seriously though, these UP kids are really lucky to be part of this historic event. Imagine applying for a job somewhere and you have your resume where you're like "I did an internship with Globe and attended some seminars, what about you?" and the other guy says "I made a satellite, it's in space now"
