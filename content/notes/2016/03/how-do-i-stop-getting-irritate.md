<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Remember: You are not your code. You are not the hundred or so lines of C or Java or Javascript or whatever that you wrote today.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This problem arises because you are too attached to your code. Your ego is associated with the code you write and you feel that any comments or defects found reflect upon   you as a person. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You are not perfect. You will not write perfect software, and that's fine. It's not a flaw, it's just the way software is. It isn't written all in one go, magically perfect and elegant and satisfying all the requirements. Good software goes through multiple iterations and many eyes looking at it. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is also important to treat it as a learning experience - learn what you can from each code review comment and try to apply what you learn to future code you write. This also helps you minimize review comments in the future. Instead of treating the large number of comments as a shortcoming on your part, treat it as a metric you can improve upon.</p></span>
