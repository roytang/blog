Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Can you murder a person because you hate him/her?](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-murder-a-person-because-you-hate-him-her/answer/Roy-Tang)


No. Not even if you think they deserve it. 

Not even considering the fact that legally it is a crime. Even if you find a way to make it legal (self-defense, etc)

Live and let live. If you hate a person, just avoid that person as much as possible. Don't let him change you.

There is already too much death in the world for us to willingly want to contribute more.
