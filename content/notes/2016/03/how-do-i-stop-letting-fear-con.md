If you are depressed, it is best to talk to a professional. This is the very first thing you should do.

Also see if you can share your fears and anxieties with friends and family and ask for their support. Maybe you also fear telling them about it, but that's fine. You've already taken the first step of asking people on the internet for help anyway. If you have trouble telling them your problems, you can send them the link to this question :) Try to ask friends or family members who you think will likely be supportive.

For your everyday fears, try facing them one at a time. Try the easiest ones first. Try a break in your routine. Go to a different coffee shop. Say hi to the barista (any small talk after that is optional!) When you go get a haircut ask the barber to suggest a different look. Or ask him how his family is doing. Little things, one at a time. It's ok to fail too. Every attempt is already a victory.
