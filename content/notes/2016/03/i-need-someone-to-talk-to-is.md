It would be best if you could talk to a professional.

If that option is not available, there might be other resources you can try like a depression hotline available in your area. If you are religious (or even if you are not actually), maybe there is a local priest or pastor willing to listen to you.

Also see if you can find any family or friends you can confide in, someone who's willing to listen. It might be difficult, but simply tell them "I have a lot on my mind. Do you have time to listen?" Don't give up and keep going until you find someone willing to listen.

When you do find someone willing to listen, talk. It might be difficult for you to explain things, but keep going, power through it and eventually it will come out.

Life is strange sometimes, it has these ups and downs. Try to weather the downs so you can get back to the ups. Good luck and don't give up
