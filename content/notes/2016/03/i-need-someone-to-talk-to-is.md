<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It would be best if you could talk to a professional.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If that option is not available, there might be other resources you can try like a depression hotline available in your area. If you are religious (or even if you are not actually), maybe there is a local priest or pastor willing to listen to you.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Also see if you can find any family or friends you can confide in, someone who's willing to listen. It might be difficult, but simply tell them "I have a lot on my mind. Do you have time to listen?" Don't give up and keep going until you find someone willing to listen.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When you do find someone willing to listen, talk. It might be difficult for you to explain things, but keep going, power through it and eventually it will come out.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Life is strange sometimes, it has these ups and downs. Try to weather the downs so you can get back to the ups. Good luck and don't give up</p></span>
