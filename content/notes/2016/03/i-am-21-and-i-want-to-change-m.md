> [I am 21 and I want to change my whole life, to make it better. Is it possible?](https://www.quora.com/I-am-21-and-I-want-to-change-my-whole-life-to-make-it-better-Is-it-possible/answer/Roy-Tang)

<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's never too late to be who you might have been.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People reinvent their lives all the time, the age is irrelevant. Colonel Sanders was almost bankrupt at 65 when he founded KFC and turned his life around. Einstein did poorly in some early school subjects but his name is now synonymous with brilliance. There are people who dropped out of college and are now some of the richest people in the world.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You yourself are the only one who can determine what you can or cannot do. Whether you will be able to change your whole life depends largely on your own determination, willpower, and effort.</p></span>
