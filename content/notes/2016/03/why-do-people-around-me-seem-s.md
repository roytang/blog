Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Why do people around me seem stuck in their ways and boring?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-around-me-seem-stuck-in-their-ways-and-boring/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For some people it's easier to live life without making too many difficult decisions. It may just be your perception though. There are many people who are deeper than they appear. Maybe they just have interests that aren't aligned with yours and thus look boring from your POV. That doesn't mean they don't live a fulfilling life. Don't worry too much about them and just make sure your own life is fulfilling :D</p></span>
