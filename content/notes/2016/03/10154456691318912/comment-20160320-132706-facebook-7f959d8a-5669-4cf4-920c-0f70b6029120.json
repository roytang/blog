  "text": "It's true, what the both of you say, regarding that. Abstaining has always been an option, and we all knew that.     But what he's talking about is a movement to make abstention a significant choice at worst (and \"win by landslide\" at best) to shame politicians into being less lousy, and maybe better.    I think it's a gamble, and one I'm not willing to play.    I doubt the magnitude of the effect of this movement unless there is a noticeable percentage (say 20% at least).    And even that's questionable. Even if it is possible to bring it to the scenario where the big posts of the land were decided by only 10% of the voters because 90% abstained in protest, we live in a society where people in power have the gall to stay in power despite accusations instead of stepping down or distancing themselves from the power-scenario that is being contested to avoid scandal and as a form of discretion. (Note: This doesn't mean they're already guilty - it just means that the-suspect-lea der distances themselves from the issue when a scandal hits them)    If the gamble fails, you've effectively ceded power to the people who didn't abstain. As you said, my vote is my drop in the bucket, and I want it to count.    I agree that the current crop of leaders isn't the best, but if I can find someone who can make the situation marginally better (and that's the million peso question, right?), I'll cast my vote for them.",
