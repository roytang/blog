JDBC is an API for Java programs to connect to SQL relational databases. JDBC drivers are implementations of the JDBC interface for various databases (Oracle, MySQL, etc)

The rest are packages in the JDBC API. There are basic tutorials on Oracle.com: [Lesson: JDBC Basics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/)
