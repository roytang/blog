  "text": "I don't think Teddy is correct.\n\nAbstaining doesn't do anything. US Presidents are elected with only ~55% of eligible voters turning out. That's been happening for years. \n\nBy Teddy's logic, the 98 million Americans who didn't cast a vote were sending a message -- but what message? The US has had 23 years of two-term (max) Presidents. \n\nWhat message do you think a Filipino President would take from low voter turnout? Nothing. Why take a message? The Presidential term is 6 years, with no chance of winning another election. Change, regardless of turnout, is more likely just because of that fact (and that the Filipino elections ride more on momentum popularity than do other elections).",
