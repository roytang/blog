  "text": "I don't think you can consider abstaining to be a vote. If you don't vote, absolutely nothing about what you've done (or failed to do) will influence the outcome. If you go to the poll and spoil your ballot (by writing in something like \"Barack Obama\"), it gets set aside just like a ballot that was ripped, or otherwise ruined. It doesn't get counted, and also fails to do anything to influence the outcome.\n\nIf the outcome is not changed by your act of abstention, then what you have considered a \"vote\" is actually just like not having voted at all.\n\n",
