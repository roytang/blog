  "text": "Absolutely, it's your right to abstain. But my point is, counter to what other people in this thread are claiming, that abstaining doesn't do anything. It's not a protest. It's not a message. It's not a \"fuck the establishment\". It's not a \"these options don't inspire me.\" It's literally \"I don't know -- you guys decide.\"\n\nThat's it. I don't like a system that requires people to vote, but I don't like to see people trying to spin abstaining into some kind of idealistic message. It just isn't.",
