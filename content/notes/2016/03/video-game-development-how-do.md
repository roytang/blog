Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Video Game Development: How do I become an "A-player" game programmer?](https://www.quora.com/Video-Game-Development-How-do-I-become-an-A-player-game-programmer/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I imagine it's the same as any type of programmer, or really any type of coworker. There's technical skill to be sure, but I think a bigger factor would be the soft skills, i.e. the person should be easy to work with, professional, willing to help his coworkers as needed and pushes the team towards their goals rather than helping</p></span>
