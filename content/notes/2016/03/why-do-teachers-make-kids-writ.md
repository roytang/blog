> [Why do teachers make kids write a 2000 word essay when a 500 word essay would be clearer and more concise?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-teachers-make-kids-write-a-2000-word-essay-when-a-500-word-essay-would-be-clearer-and-more-concise/answer/Roy-Tang)


<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Minimum length requirements are inflated to take into account the BS that students write. If students write 500 words of meaningful response + 1500 words of BS for a 2,000 word essay, then for a 500 word essay, you're likely to get only 125 words of meaningful response.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">And even the mere act of thinking up 1,500 additional words of BS is something, at least you're trying to think about things tangentially related to the topic at hand. </p></span>
