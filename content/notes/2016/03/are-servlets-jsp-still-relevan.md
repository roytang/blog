Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Are Servlets/JSP still relevant?](https://www.quora.com/Are-Servlets-JSP-still-relevant/answer/Roy-Tang)


They are still in use. Not all companies follow the latest trends and use the latest technologies. If by relevant you mean you can still find work using those technologies, I don't think you'll have to worry about it for a while, since there are many active systems using JSP/Servlets for sure. After all, even COBOL specialists can still find work these days :)
