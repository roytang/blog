<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">They are still in use. Not all companies follow the latest trends and use the latest technologies. If by relevant you mean you can still find work using those technologies, I don't think you'll have to worry about it for a while, since there are many active systems using JSP/Servlets for sure. After all, even COBOL specialists can still find work these days :)</p></span>
