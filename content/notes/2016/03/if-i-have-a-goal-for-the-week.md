<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It can be something as simple as a checklist that you verify at the end of the period to make sure you've done all the necessary things. Add a reminder/notification to your phone to remind you to do the thing you have to do for your goal. Tell your friends about your goal to keep you honest.</p></span>
