Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Why everyone does not improve with time? Why everyone does not learn from their mistakes?](https://www.quora.com/Why-everyone-does-not-improve-with-time-Why-everyone-does-not-learn-from-their-mistakes/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's either they can't afford it, or they don't see the value and don't want to bother.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">They can't afford it: Not everyone has the patience or the time or the capacity to focus on self-improvement. It is often a luxury that may be difficult to afford. This category includes people with stressful, time-consuming jobs and people who may be so poor they literally spend all their time struggling to survive. Or they may be in circumstances that make it much more difficult to improve their lot</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">They don't see the value: These are people who have settled in to their environments and don't see the point of trying to better oneself; or people who are too lazy to try to improve themselves. In this category you can put people growing up in poor neighborhoods where there will often be peer pressure to be one of the gang and trying to better yourself is frowned upon. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Sadly, parents can pass on this attitude to this children</p></span>
