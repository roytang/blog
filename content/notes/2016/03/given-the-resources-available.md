Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Given the resources available, why didn't Native American cultures develop more advanced metal working skills than they did e.g., iron working skills?](https://www.quora.com/Given-the-resources-available-why-didnt-Native-American-cultures-develop-more-advanced-metal-working-skills-than-they-did-e-g-iron-working-skills/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is a significant difference in the natural resources available in the Americas during earlier eras as compared to Asia/Europe. I would suggest reading Jared Diamond's "Guns Germs and Steel" which delves into these differences and their effects on the advancement of cultures in different continents</p></span>
