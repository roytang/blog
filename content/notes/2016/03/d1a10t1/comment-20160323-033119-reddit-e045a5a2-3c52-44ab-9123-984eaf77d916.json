  "text": "10 actions:\n* Tanggalin ang LAPIDA or Liberalization, Privitization, and Deregulation of social services.\n* Mass-oriented, nationalist, and scientific education system\n* Address the landlessness of many farmers by enacting GARB or Genuine Agrarian Reform\n* Pantay na karapatan sa mga kababaihan\n* Improved healthcare\n* More investments ng gobyerno sa scientific sector\n\nSo far yan lang ang nakikita ko.\n\nPara naman sa business, you have to recognize that these workers have rights. Don't pay them below minimum wage, and don't block them from forming unions so they can address their concerns. Once you do that, the NPA won't have a problem with you.\n\nFinal point naman, mahirap kasi halos walang koneksyon ang bawat unit sa isa't isa, ngunit susubukan ko.\n",
