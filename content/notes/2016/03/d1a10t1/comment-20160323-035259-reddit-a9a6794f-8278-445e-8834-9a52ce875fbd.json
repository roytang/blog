  "text": "> Tanggalin ang LAPIDA or Liberalization, Privitization, and Deregulation of social services.\n\nWhich social services are currently in the most need of these changes? Isn't it a problem that the government has insufficient resources to provide social services which is why some need to be augmented by the private sector? Also, how does that acronym even make sense\n\n> Mass-oriented, nationalist, and scientific education system\n\nWhat exactly does mass-oriented mean here? Does nationalist mean dapat may communist propaganda sa curriculum?\n\n> Address the landlessness of many farmers by enacting GARB or Genuine Agrarian Reform\n\nDoesn't the movement have lawmaker allies? Have they introduced any legislation towards this end?\n\n> Pantay na karapatan sa mga kababaihan\n\nWhich rights specifically are a problem right now? I understand that society still doesn't treat women equally, but that seems to me to be primarily a cultural problem and not of policy. I mean, in terms of policy I believe women already basically share the same rights as men in this country (suffrage, etc). There are probably still some outliers, but maybe not being a woman I'm not aware\n\n> More investments ng gobyerno sa scientific sector\n\nIs this something the movement is a strong advocate of? I don't think I've ever heard of NPA spokespersons discussing this.\n\n> So far yan lang ang nakikita ko.\n\nThese are your personal suggestions right? Is there nothing like a central leadership that establishes such policies? Like some sort of quarterly announcement \"Guys, eto yung mga gusto natin mangyari ok?\"\n\n\n\n",
