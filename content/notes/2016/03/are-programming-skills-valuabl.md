Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Are programming skills valuable for an economics graduate?](https://www.quora.com/Are-programming-skills-valuable-for-an-economics-graduate/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Having a mix of skills will be incredibly valuable for you since it makes you "rarer". Look for the place where your skills/interests intersect - that is a good niche for you to pursue since there will be fewer people to compete with. i.e. look for programming work where an economics domain would be an advantage, or work for an economics graduate (I have no idea what that entails LOL) where you can leverage your programming knowledge (maybe via program-assisted data crunching or analysis). It's better than competing against everyone who is a programmer.</p></span>
