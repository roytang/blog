> [I'm 29 with a high-paid, senior job but I want to follow my original passion as an automotive fabricator. How do I convince my family I'm not crazy?](https://www.quora.com/Im-29-with-a-high-paid-senior-job-but-I-want-to-follow-my-original-passion-as-an-automotive-fabricator-How-do-I-convince-my-family-Im-not-crazy/answer/Roy-Tang)

<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Think about WHY you need to convince them you're not crazy?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I understand the need to have your family understand what you're doing, even if you're not dependent on them for financial reasons. If you really need to explain it to them, try to communicate that:</p><ol><li>This is something you've always wanted to do</li><li>You've thought about the risks and consequences thoroughly</li><li>You've prepared some measures in case it doesn't work out - you have a buffer of savings, etc (if you haven't done this, you should consider doing it first!)</li><li>Set a time limit (I'm going to take 1 year off to try to pursue this dream, if it doesn't work out, I can go back to my other field)</li></ol><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!</p></span>
