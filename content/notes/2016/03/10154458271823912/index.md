Daredevil Season 2 spoiler-free review: 

- Punisher and Karen were great 
- Matt and Elektra, kind of weird, but I guess it's okay 
- great fight scenes and cinematography as usual 
- the plot is less tightly focused than compared to S1, there's a lot of things going on at the same time.  
- it starts a bit slow, but picks up later on, then slow down a bit again and picks up again 
- they pick up some leftover threads from S1, all the surviving major players make an appearance 
- the Daredevil costume feels so weird, and it feels like it sometimes changes in shading/composition across episodes (it makes it harder to draw lol) 
- there's some romantic tension being formed but it feels a bit off or maybe even forced 
- I want to complain about some (minor) things, but it's hard to do that without you know, spoilers lol 
- ending felt weaker than S1
