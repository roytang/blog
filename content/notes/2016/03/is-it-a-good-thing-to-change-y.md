It is. But be wary of changing your mind or moving forward just for the sake of it.

It's a good thing to be open-minded and to be willing to consider and try out new things, but that doesn't mean automatically latching on to new fads. Try out new things, study them critically and figure out whether they are the best for you or will contribute to your personal growth.
