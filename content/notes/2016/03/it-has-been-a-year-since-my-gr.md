> [It has been a year since my grandmother died and I still can't forget her. How do I get over her?](https://www.quora.com/It-has-been-a-year-since-my-grandmother-died-and-I-still-cant-forget-her-How-do-I-get-over-her/answer/Roy-Tang)

<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Moving on doesn't mean forgetting her. Don't dwell too much on her death; whenever you find yourself thinking about that topic, try to refocus your thoughts to her life and to your good memories together with her. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It might be difficult to let go, but it will come eventually with time. In the meantime, try to find new ways to occupy your mind and keep you distracted. A new hobby or something else to direct your attention to. Ask your friends to help you with this as well.</p></span>
