The world is a large and varied place, filled with many things that may or may not pique your interest. If you find your current environment or activities boring, then it is up to you to step outside of it and seek out things that will engage you more.

It might be daunting because the world offers many possibilities, and not all of them may look interesting at first. I suggest trying out a lot of different things, exploring widely (breadth-first in computer science speak) until you find one or two threads you find interesting then following the ones most promising
