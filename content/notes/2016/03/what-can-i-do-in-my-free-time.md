> [What can I do in my free time to improve my math skills?](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-in-my-free-time-to-improve-my-math-skills/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are already using up 8-10 hours a day just for math, you may be overdoing it already. Your brain needs to function on a wide variety of inputs, so try to participate in other activities too. Keeping a healthy balance will give you a wider perspective and will help you attack problems from different angles.</p></span>
