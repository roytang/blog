> [My friend just died from a stroke during his sleep. How can I get rid of my constant fear that someday I would die like him?](https://www.quora.com/My-friend-just-died-from-a-stroke-during-his-sleep-How-can-I-get-rid-of-my-constant-fear-that-someday-I-would-die-like-him/answer/Roy-Tang)


<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People die at seemingly random times all the time. Not everybody lives up to "old age" and even when you do you still don't know when death will come for you. There's no point worrying about it, if you die you die. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Stay healthy, take care of yourself and be careful not to walk down dangerous areas at night. Now, even though you do all these precautions, there's no guarantee you won't suddenly die due to some random accident. Just do what you can and live your life to the fullest. Live each moment as if it might be your last, appreciate the things you have and the people you love and know that they might all vanish in a heartbeat</p></span>
