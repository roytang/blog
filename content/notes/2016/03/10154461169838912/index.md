I sat down to write a poem 

Surely it couldn't be that hard 

To stitch words together In rhyme and iambic pentameter  

My fingers spun across the keys 

And words spilled out in twos and threes 

My first efforts didn't feel like poetry 

More like rhyming words trying to tell a story 

Dozens of lines discarded  

Why did the words elude me? 

Are they hidden there, in some unknown shadow of my mind 

Running away, burrowing deep, when I turn a corner?  

Was I not good enough? 

Do I need to find a way to light a spark? 

Or maybe poetry isn't something you force into the light 

Maybe poetry only comes to us in the dark
