> [I recently realize at work I'm not very good at giving current status in an adhoc, on-demand way. What are ways I can improve this (if I should)?](https://www.quora.com/I-recently-realize-at-work-Im-not-very-good-at-giving-current-status-in-an-adhoc-on-demand-way-What-are-ways-I-can-improve-this-if-I-should/answer/Roy-Tang)

<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are finding it difficult to deal with the interruptions, I suggest taking it up with your manager.
