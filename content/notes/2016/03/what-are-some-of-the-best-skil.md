<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><ol><li>Communication, both written and spoken: The future will be more and more an idea-driven economy, and being able to present your ideas to the marketplace in a clear way that makes it easier to appreciate their value will give you a leg up.</li><li>Software development/coding: With technology advancing as fast as ever, more and more jobs will be taken over by software or by automation. The one job that will be the last to become obsolete will be the people who write the software driving the future. </li></ol></span>
