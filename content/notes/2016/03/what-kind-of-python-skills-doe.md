It probably depends largely on the software you are testing. You can use Python to perform automation tasks (running a software multiple times with different parameters to check the outputs) that would otherwise be time-consuming to do manually. You can also use it to generate large data sets (inputs) and the corresponding outputs, and then compare against the expected outputs.

It's not necessarily Python either, any scripting language that can interact with the software you are testing will prove to be a helpful tool.
