Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [I am a software developer, working on dot net. I am fresher and 24 years old. I remain very nervous during work and during talking to my leads. How can I be more confident and bold?](https://www.quora.com/I-am-a-software-developer-working-on-dot-net-I-am-fresher-and-24-years-old-I-remain-very-nervous-during-work-and-during-talking-to-my-leads-How-can-I-be-more-confident-and-bold/answer/Roy-Tang)


First of all, do good work. If you do good work and are aware of it, it's easier to be confident when talking to other people. 

Sometimes, confidence can only come with time and experience.

Since you are new, you may not be sure about certain things, whether you are doing them the right way or not. Don't be afraid to clarify things you are uncertain about, it is a good quality of software developers to try to flesh out details. "Is this how the output is expected to look like?", etc

Don't worry too much about making mistakes - everyone makes mistakes at some point. But be sure to show a willingness to learn where you made mistakes and how to avoid it in the future.
