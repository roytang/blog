<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's never too late to become who you want to be. Also, you are still pretty young.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It might be a bit difficult to get work starting out if you follow traditional channels  (many HR departments look for the degree), but the great thing about this industry is that there are a lot of ways to get software development work without going through HR hoops. You can work freelance/online easily and there are a number of websites that can help you do this. The industry is one that is more meritocratic than most; as long as you do good work, you will be able to find more work.</p></span>
