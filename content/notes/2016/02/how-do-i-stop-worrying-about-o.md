Ask yourself what you're worried about. It's not a crime to be average

There's a simple truth in life: for almost all people, there's always someone better

You can try to improve or better yourself, but you should be doing it for your own benefit, not so you can compare favorably to other people. 

How hard you work and what level of skill or talent you try to achieve should be dependent entirely on you and what you want for yourself, not on other people
