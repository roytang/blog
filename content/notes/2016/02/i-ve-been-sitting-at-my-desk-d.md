Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

Is this normal?](https://www.quora.com/Ive-been-sitting-at-my-desk-doing-nothing-at-a-large-tech-company-and-am-feeling-incredibly-uninspired-I-feel-like-quitting-Is-this-normal/answer/Roy-Tang)


<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">A friend recently moved to a new job and told me that they sent her home early because the work for the day has already been done. I told her my impression of that company was that people slack off a lot there and she said "Is that really a bad thing?" I said it can be, because for me if I'm bored or have nothing to do for extended periods of time I would be unhappy. Everyone has their own level of challenge that they need to face in their daily life and if you're not getting that, it might lead to further unhappiness down the road. To keep yourself entertained, you can take the time to either do some self-improvement (learn a new language! etc) or talk to your manager and see if there is some work that you could be doing while waiting for your real work (warning: volunteering for work beyond your role may have rewards, but it often also leads to people assigning you even more work!)</p></span>
