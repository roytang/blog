<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's not just professionals. Everytime you go out and interact with other people you are entertaining some sort of risk. There is always a chance that a stranger you meet is a psycopath who might mislead you or worse. There's also the danger that when you walk down the street, a car might accidentally hit your or when you pass by a construction site you might die in a freak accident. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You don't think about all those other small everyday risks do you? For the same reason you shouldn't worry too much about people screwing you over. You could live life in a bubble, hiding away from all risk of danger and being paranoid about other people and never trusting them, but that's not really what I'd call life.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"></p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I'm not saying you just *let* people screw you over. You have to be smart. Before you consult a professional check their reputation or ask friends who have been their clients before. When working with a professional for the first time ask questions to assuage your worries. But as you say, you won't be able to verify their work on every level so at some point you have to be able to trust them not to be an evil psychopath. </p></span>
