> [How can I change my attitude towards exercise?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-change-my-attitude-towards-exercise/answer/Roy-Tang)


First of all, stop letting other people's opinions affect you so much. If your family questions you working out at home, explain it to them. If there are people making fun of you at the gym, ignore them, they are not relevant to you. You should be exercising for yourself, not for other people.

There are exercises you can do on your own, outside of the gym. Running is a good start.
