Now let's get a few things clear, because Facebook has just become so toxic:

Celebrating EDSA does not mean we're celebrating the Aquinos

Despising Ferdinand Marcos does not mean admiring Cory Aquino 

Opposing Bongbong Marcos does not mean supporting Mar Roxas or Noynoy Aquino 

Enjoying democracy is not the same as lacking in discipline

Desiring peace and order does not mean discarding civil liberties

If you can't wrap your head around that, then I'm sorry for you.
