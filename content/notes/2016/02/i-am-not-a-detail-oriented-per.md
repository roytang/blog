Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [I am not a detail-oriented person but I like how software development can change people's lives, would I enjoy coding?](https://www.quora.com/I-am-not-a-detail-oriented-person-but-I-like-how-software-development-can-change-peoples-lives-would-I-enjoy-coding/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Coding is very much a detail-oriented task. The syntax of most programming languages makes that obvious - forget a semicolon somewhere and your entire program may fall apart. Even non-coding roles in a software development team such as business analysts require some degree of attention to detail as otherwise they would be doing substandard work.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">However, your question is whether you would *enjoy* coding. It is possible you may enjoy coding even though your attention to detail is low. If you love things such as problem-solving or learning how things work, there's a good chance. The only way to be sure is to try it!</p></span>
