> [How can I become less bored with life?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-become-less-bored-with-life/answer/Roy-Tang)


Some things to try:

1. Spend more time with your family, go out on trips or just hang out with them all day

2. Find a hobby. What is something you always wanted to try?

3. Start looking for a new job. Maybe finding a job will be hard for you, but simply looking around might expose you to opportunities you would never otherwise find

4. Start an exercise program. I recommend running

5. Meditate

6. Find out what your friends do for fun and ask to be involved / more involved

7. Don't have friends? Find more friends :D 

8. Explore your neighborhood

9. Start a side business to keep you occuped

10. Chat up strangers everywhere you go

11. Have an affair (just kidding, don't do this)
