Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [When, why and where servlets, jsp, jstl, el come into picture?](https://www.quora.com/When-why-and-where-servlets-jsp-jstl-el-come-into-picture/answer/Roy-Tang)


What exactly are you asking? 

Servlets are used for request processing.

JSP is a template language for generating web pages (they can be used to generate any kind of HTTP response)

JSTL is a standard tag library available for use inside JSP. EL is an expression language also used inside JSP.

If you need a primer on this stuff, I've found the Head First Servlets and JSP book to be reasonably good.
