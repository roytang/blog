Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [How can you tell how good a programmer is?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-you-tell-how-good-a-programmer-is/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Speaking as someone who's had to evaluate the performance of developers in a project team of around 20-30: it's not easy.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you want to evaluate programmers for recruitment purposes it's particularly difficult. It's hard to make an assessment from a couple of 30-minute interviews and code written for a toy problem. It's best to observe them in an actual work environment, see how they interact with their peers, see how they react to crisis.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you're evaluating a resume, you'll want to look for signs of people who are passionate about programming - this might mean programming done outside of work/as a hobby (for example, open source projects, attending seminars, local programming group membership, etc). During an interview, ask them about best practices, refactoring, that kind of thing.</p></span>
