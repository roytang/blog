A lot of software developers deal with legacy code and horribly-designed systems, it's hard to avoid. But the great thing with being a software developer is that we have a lot of avenues to apply creativity to boring tasks. Try to automate the boring parts, then you can get more work done. Or maybe build a tool to help map the horribly-designed system to make it easier to manage. 

If your job doesn't allow you to do these sort of things, well I'd start looking for another job ;p
