> [Why do people interrupt programmers when they are in the zone? Is it for deliberately reducing the company's productivity?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-interrupt-programmers-when-they-are-in-the-zone-Is-it-for-deliberately-reducing-the-companys-productivity/answer/Roy-Tang)


<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The problem with programming work is that it's not intuitively obvious to non-programmers when you're in the zone and actually working hard instead of just randomly tapping away at the keyboard. It looks the same whether you're talking with someone over IM or actually rearranging some complicated piece of code.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I don't think many people deliberately try to reduce productivity, more of they don't understand how programming works.</p></span>
