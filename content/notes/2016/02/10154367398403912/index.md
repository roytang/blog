Deadpool â€” with Brian, Alvin Joseph (@Ristorante Bigoli 4/F TriNoma)

Here we go, DEADPOOL spoiler-free review: 

- definitely not for kids; violence, sex, nudity, you name it 
- as you'd expect of a Deadpool movie, lots of jokes, one-liners and fourth wall-breaking. It's a barrel of laughs 
- the plot is mostly straightforward 
- some really nice shots and set pieces 
- lots of references and fan service 
- great supporting cast; hope to see them again in the sequel 
- Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead were great 
- I kind of want to read more Deadpool comics now 
- This movie is better than: Ant-Man (sorry Scott!) 
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: NO 
- Post-credit scene: YES
