<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">First, might be a good idea to know how to spell.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Second, "intelligence" isn't going to come quickly. You will need practice, and an attitude that's biased towards learning and critical thinking</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you want to develop and improve your intelligence, here are some things to try:</p><ul><li>Read more. Both fiction and nonfiction. For nonfiction, try to read a lot of different topics: finance, history, current events, etc.</li><li>Be well-informed, be aware of current events</li><li>Practice problem solving. It can be math problems (take out your high school algebra or trig book and see if you can still do the problems) or some sort of puzzles (crosswords, sudoku, etc). Try to solve problems of the appropriate difficulty - if it's too easy for you, try to look for a bit more difficult problems</li><li>Practice critical thinking. This isn't a straightforward skill to learn, and many people graduate from school without learning it. One way to practice this, especially if it's an election year for you: study public statements made by politicians and ask yourself: are they telling the truth? What aren't they saying? What kind of parties might be influencing their statements? </li><li>Hang out with people who have an intelligent mindset. Engage them in debates or conversations. Doesn't have to be deep topics like the benefits of parliamentary vs presidential systems, it can be some trivial stuff like "which star wars movie is best"</li><li>Are you in school/college? Does your school have a debate team? See if you can join</li><li>Expand your horizons: Try new things.</li><li>Spend less time watching TV. Or maybe try to insert some documentaries in your TV watching.</li><li>Try to educate others. Learn to explain things to other people.</li><li>Be reflective: At the end of the day, think about what things you've learned during the day</li></ul></span>
