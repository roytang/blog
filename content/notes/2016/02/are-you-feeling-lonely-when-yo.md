If you are feeling lonely when you program, it might be that you don't really enjoy programming and you might consider transitioning to a different career later on.

Or maybe you are in a company where you are the only software developer in a team, in which case yes you might feel lonely or out of place among other colleagues.

I believe it is best for career software developers to be in a team with other software developers, evolving a code base together. When you're working with other people's code and their mistakes, you will never be lonely :D
