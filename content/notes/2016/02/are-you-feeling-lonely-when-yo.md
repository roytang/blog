<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are feeling lonely when you program, it might be that you don't really enjoy programming and you might consider transitioning to a different career later on.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Or maybe you are in a company where you are the only software developer in a team, in which case yes you might feel lonely or out of place among other colleagues.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I believe it is best for career software developers to be in a team with other software developers, evolving a code base together. When you're working with other people's code and their mistakes, you will never be lonely :D</p></span>
