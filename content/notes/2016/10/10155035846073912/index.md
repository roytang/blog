Not to take away from the violent murder (that we're all sadly getting used to), the following stood out to me:

> "Asked to comment on a Reuters report that highlighted widespread discrepancies in statistics related to Duterte's drugs crackdown, Ronald 'Bato' dela Rosa appeared irked at police and took a swipe at journalists for what he called 'unfair' reporting.
> 
> He said: 'Talk to me, but don't go to the media to talk about those things.
> 
> 'Tell our men, the officers who had said this, if they had balls, they should talk to me.'"
> 
> Up to now still no response to the claims of false statistics?
