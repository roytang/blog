This happened yesterday in broad daylight, just outside a friend's house. 

Sometimes I wonder if this is what people meant when they said Davao City was "safe". Or what Alan Peter was referring to when he said we're as safe as Singapore. AFAIK these kinds of rubouts don't happen on a regular basis in Singapore

Even if you believe the authorities are not at all involved with these executions, should you be staying silent on their incompetence in being unable to deal with them? 

Even if you say these sorts of things happened even in the past, do you believe they happened with the same regularity, and around the same areas? I've been living near the Tandang Sora x Commonwealth area for more than a decade and I've *never* heard of someone getting executed in that area 

And if you're the sort who believes that these people deserve what they get for involvement in drugs (including the "collateral damage"?), well, I try to see the best in each person and it's a point of pride for me that I've never had to cut ties with someone over politics, but it would be very tempting...

  A couple of hours ago, I was walking to the UP gate from class when a friend stopped me for a quick chat. We hung out a little until we eventually parted ways. After that, I resumed walking to the gate so I can board a tricycle to Tandang Sora. When I got there, there was a commotion. A crowd was starting to build up at the corner of Tandang Sora and Commonwealth. There were also some policemen around. So I decided to take a quick look. When I got close enough, I saw people taking photos of the ground. Upon closer inspection, I saw small pools and drops of fresh blood. There were also damaged posts, signages, and wires. So I went to the nearest stall and asked the owner what happened. She told me that men on motorcycles opened fire and accidentally hit two people who were sitting on the front seat of a jeepney. They were rushed to the hospital thereafter.

  On my way home, all I could think about is this.. That could've been me. That's exactly where I walk on my way home from school. That was where I should've been at that exact moment, if my friend didn't stop me for a quick chat. That could've been me on the front seat of that jeepney.

  I don't feel safe in my own neighborhood anymore. I don't feel safe in my own country. The chances of getting shot randomly or ending up as collateral damage are too high. I don't feel safe here.

  Update: Apparently, the gunmen were targeting a policeman who was inside the jeep at that time. This policeman was ALLEGEDLY involved in the drug trade. Unfortunately, he did not survive the attack. 4 others were injured.
