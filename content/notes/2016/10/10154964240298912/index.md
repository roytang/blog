> "As a German, everything that is happening, has happened to us. People didn't take the threats seriously. We praised a politician for fixing our country (and quickly) when no one else could and after we'd suffered for years. And it didn't matter to what extremes he did it, as long as it was done. And many remained silent on the crazy ideas he was sharing, because, surely, we thought, he couldn't actually mean it. Surely, someone will stop him before it would ever get out of hand. But it was too late. No one did anything. No one thought they could do anything. That's where we were so very wrong."
