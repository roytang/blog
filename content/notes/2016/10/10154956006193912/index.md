Luke Cage spoiler-free review:

- this is an unapologetically very black show. It highlights black culture, black music, black history, and so on
- gang violence, sleazy politicians, corrupt cops
- most of the cast give great performances
- rosario dawson's role seems to get bigger with each additional series
- lots of great easter eggs for comic book fans
- might have been an episode or two too long
- I did not like the ending too much, though I can see why they might have gone that way
