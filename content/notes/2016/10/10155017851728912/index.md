Comments from an American BPO owner: 

"The bottom line is that I'm worried. Other foreign business owners are worried too. Indonesia and Vietnam are beautiful countries but it's not as easy to do business there as it is here. India? I'd rather go back and work a desk job in America than run a business there - even if my cost of doing business is far lower.

In the coming weeks, I'll begin the arduous process of researching alternative locations to run my business in the event that The Philippines will no longer be a viable option. It will be an extremely sad process because these countries all lack the one thing that makes the Philippines such an amazing place to live and do business: the Filipino people. While I worry about the future of my business here in the Philippines, I worry even more that the people of this great but tragic country will get beat down yet again. The plutocrats stamp their feet and the middle class and poor get smashed into the ground. This is the way of things in the Philippines. You all deserve so much better."
