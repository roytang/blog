DOCTOR STRANGE Spoiler-free review:

- Wow. Great visuals and fight-scenes, very trippy. Possibly the best fight scenes in all the MCU movies so far. You might get dizzy with all the things spinning around though
- Plot is typical of a MCU origin story. Hero's journey, some light comedy bits, etc.
- I was expecting them to go a different way with Mordo (if you've read the comics you know what I mean), but I'm happy with how things went down
- Stakes are high, but failure is not final
- The actors were great; I haven't seen a lead this good for a role since RDJ's Tony Stark. Swinton's Ancient One, Eijofor's Mordo, and even Wong's Wong were great
- Doctor friends: Tell me if the medical parts were BS hohoho
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. She doesn't like this kind of thing, and the dizziness thing is bad too
- IMAX or not? I think the 3d parts weren't too exaggerated or critical, but the visuals might feel a bit flat and not as impressive if you don't go IMAX
- Midcredits scene? Yes
- Postcredits scene? Yes
