Looks like Rappler's series on social media manipulation has hit a nerve. Also some relevant text from another of Maria Ressa's posts: 

> "There was one valid question: why didn't our series focus on the accounts against Duterte? We looked (and continue to look), but while there are some pages, they weren't as effective nor did they scale as much as the propaganda machine the series did focus on."

I actually thought about writing a program to crawl FB's network graph to check those accounts who are members of various propaganda groups to see how old they were, whether they all clustered around the same core group, and how often they posted, etc - all info which can be used as indication of fake accounts created to manipulate perceptions. As per usual though, my laziness overcame me ðŸ˜›

This is run of the mill now: threatens death and calls me a whore.A little more creative - My father is Satan - from an account that has 1 follower.THIS is new - "waste of sperm" - but the litany of misogynistic words, not so new.Also a bit run of the mill now - cursing and oligarch. Um, I got a scholarship and worked 3 jobs to put myself through college.Let's add graphics!
