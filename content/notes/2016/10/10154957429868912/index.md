The problem isn't the Hitler comparison per se. Leaders get compared to Hitler all the time. The problem was saying he'll happily slaughter 3 million if they were drug addicts, as if being a drug addict justifies slaughter. Note that it's drug addicts, not even pushers! (Offending the jews by comparing them to drug addicts was a secondary problem, as I don't believe he intended that, despite how it seems; just his runaway mouth saying ridiculous things as normal)
