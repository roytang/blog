I couldn't help it. Here we go #afewgoodmen

D: "You want answers?"

"I think I'm entitled to them"

D: "You want answers?"

"I want the truth!"

D: "You can't handle the truth! Son, we live in a world that has drugs, and those drugs have to be defeated by men with guns. Who's gonna do it? You? I have a greater responsibility than you could possibly fathom. You weep for the collateral damage and you curse the police. You have that luxury, you have the luxury of not knowing what I know. That the collateral deaths, while tragic, probably saved lives. And my existence, while grotesque and impenetrable to you, saves lives. You don't want the truth because deep down in places you don't talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, you need me on that wall. We use words like slaughter, obosen, killings. We use them as a backbone of a life spent defending something. You use them as a punchline. I have neither the time nor the inclination to explain myself to a man who rises and sleeps under the blanket of the very safety that I provide and then questions the manner in which I provide it. I would rather you just said thank you, and went on your way. Otherwise, I suggest you pick up a weapon, and kill some druggies. Either way, I don't give a damn what you think you are entitled to."

"Did you order the extrajudicial killings?"

D: "I did the job I --"

"DID YOU ORDER THE EXTRAJUDICIAL KILLINGS?"

D: "YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT I DID"

(That required surprisingly few substitutions)
