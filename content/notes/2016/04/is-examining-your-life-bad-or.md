Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Is examining your life bad or good?](https://www.quora.com/Is-examining-your-life-bad-or-good/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's usually good to have some level of self-awareness and mindfulness about your situation, where you are in life, where you're going, where you want to go, what steps you have to do, etc. Just don't let yourself get too lost in self-analysis or overthinking that you fail to take action</p></span>
