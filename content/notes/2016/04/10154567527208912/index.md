  Change Is Coming
 </p>
 <p>
  Change is definitely coming. Whether it's a good change or not will be up to us as a nation.
 </p>
 <p>
  They say most of the time parents know best. I should have believed that. We were having dinner one night during the start of the campaign season. My parents and I were talking about the presidential aspirants. I said I'm most likely voting for Duterte. My parents were shocked. They both said he's a very dangerous choice. Of course I did not back down. I said that we need a strong leader and he's the man to get it done. We ended up arguing about the merits or lack thereof  of Duterte. Long story short, in the end I was proven wrong.
 </p>
 <p>
  I was pro Duterte in the beginning. Blinded by the desire to have meaningful change. I was willing to overlook his short comings and compromise my values and principles. That's how desperate I wanted change. As the campaign went by and as Duterte revealed more and more of himself my support started to waiver. Towards the end my support for him turned into disdain. I could not believe I once thought I wanted him as the next President.
 </p>
 <p>
  Duterte is a walking contradiction. Saying one thing and doing another. He triumphs law and order but willing to violate the law to bring it about. He talks anti corruption and yet he wants to bury the biggest symbol of corruption in the place where true heroes are buried. He speaks of women's rights yet jokes about rape.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I heard him say he wanted to bury Marcos at the Libingan ng nga Bayani that was the reason my convictions got shook. I was jolted back into my senses. The blinders were taken off. I began to examine him closer. Paid attention to both sides of the argument. Those for him and against him. I no longer had blind loyalty. I turned into a skeptic.
 </p>
 <p>
  I realized that this is a man not fit to be our leader. I will not take away his merits as Davao City Mayor. He did good things, granted. Davao is not the Philippines though. Running a city is different from running a country. His cowboy ways will not work for our nation. We're not in the Wild West.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can't have a man who would make it state policy to kill people. Killing should always be the last resort. Killing can't be undone. When you kill someone and realize later on it was a mistake you can't undo it. Put someone in prison you can still set him free if you made a mistake. You can't bring time back but you can at least give him the time after.
 </p>
 <p>
  Killing is also not the best way to punish criminals. What does it do except give them an easy way out. They will not suffer after. There's a popular line that says "di pa huhuli ng buhay". Hardened criminals would rather die than go to prison. Prison is a much harder sentence. Living the rest of your life in misery, caged behind bars is a fate much worse than going into the darkness of death. Why give them the easy way out? Killing is the lazy solution. Bypass due process and just kill.
 </p>
 <p>
  We can suppress crime and corruption by fixing the institutions that are broken. Fix the justice system, don't give police the authority to become criminals themselves. This will take longer but this is lasting and the right kind of change.
 </p>
 <p>
  Duterte is a man that puts no weight in his words. He doesn't mean what he says. Or maybe he does but only when it's convenient. How many times has he flip flopped on things he said?
 </p>
 <p>
  One thing he's good at is promising the world just to get you on his side. His promise of stopping crime in 3-6 months is impossible. He realized that and back tracked to saying he will suppress it.
 </p>
 <p>
  But granted he does good in his promise and eradicates crime in 6 months, what then? He has shown no concrete economic plans. Or other plans for that matter. All I hear him say is I will copy the plans of the others. Even jokingly says he's been cheating since grade 1.
 </p>
 <p>
  Davao took 20 something years to get where it is today. That's just one city. How can he fix this country in 6 years? I don't think anyone can.
 </p>
 <p>
  We all want change. We want it now. We want shortcuts. We want change but don't want to change ourselves. Duterte supporters say with him as president our country will be better. People will follow him. If that's true then why is Cayetano languishing at the lower end of the surveys? Duterte already said vote for Cayetano. He needs him during his presidency. Very few seem to listen. So how can we change when you can't even follow what your chosen leader says?
 </p>
 <p>
  We want change but we want someone to do it for us.
 </p>
 <p>
  Change is coming but I fear it is not the right kind of change. Nor is it a change for the better. A Duterte presidency is a scary proposition. I fear that a lot have been fooled into believing the illusion. Believing in the hype. I know some are sincere in their wanting for a better life and believe Duterte is the man to do it. Sadly I think this isn't so.
 </p>
 <p>
  We need meaningful change. Not one brought about by fear. We need to curb crime and corruption but not by committing crimes in order to achieve it. We're just replacing one criminal with another. We need change that's done the right way. It will not come easily or quickly but it will be more lasting if done right.
 </p>
 <p>
  I asked my self "is my life better now than it was 6 years ago?" The answer is yes. Is it perfect? No. But it's better. There is no denying that our country is better now than years ago. I'm not the one saying that. That is the judgement of our international peers. We have made gains.
 </p>
 <p>
  Now before you accuse me of being a PNoy lover or apologist, I'm not. I'm just calling a spade a spade. He screwed up a number of times but there's no denying he did good things as well. If you look at it objectively and take away feelings and biases you will see that.
 </p>
 <p>
  That being said I fear a Duterte presidency will take away our gains. I can't imagine how he will fair against leaders of other nations. If he's capable of representing the best in us to the world. If he can play nice with the world. We can't isolate ourselves from the world. The world will not stop while we fix our problems here. It will go on. We need a president who can do both. Take care of our problems here as well as represent our interests globally.
 </p>
 <p>
  The most important reason why I won't vote for him is this... I realized that in voting for him I will give up a lot of the things I believe in. I will compromise my values and principles. I will turn a blind eye to many things I deem wrong in order to bring change. That's just unacceptable to me. I'm willing to sacrifice some but there's a limit.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the end of the day I want a president who will inspire not instill fear. I want a president whom children can aspire to become. I want a president who can do the right thing and do it properly. No shortcuts.
 </p>
 <p>
  Change is coming but I don't want Duterte's brand of change. It's not going to be for the better. In this case the ends definitely don't justify the means. The means is as important as the result. That's the only way we can have lasting change. Duterte is just not that person to do it.
