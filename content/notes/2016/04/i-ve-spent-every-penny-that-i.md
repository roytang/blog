Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [I've spent every penny that I have made on food, bars and just having fun. Have I missed the point of life?](https://www.quora.com/Ive-spent-every-penny-that-I-have-made-on-food-bars-and-just-having-fun-Have-I-missed-the-point-of-life/answer/Roy-Tang)


The answer to that depends entirely on you - do you think the point of life is just to eat, go to bars and have fun? Do you think there's more to life than that?

Do what you want and enjoy life, but maybe try not to burn up or use up all your resources, money, etc. People can change and mellow with age, and maybe at a later date your priorities will change and you will wish you had saved just a bit more money.
