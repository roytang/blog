I've seen a few variations of these "logical conclusions" floating around. Aside from the glaring grammatical problems, the main issue is that it narrows the possible cases to the only two where Trillianes is an idiot. But this is literally not Trillianes' first expose, he knows how to roll with this sort of thing. He could make up some sort of ridiculous way he got ahold of the bank documents. Wasn't there some case a while back where documents were allegedly left behind by a mysterious old lady? And even if he did obtain the documents illegally, he doesn't have to do any affidavit, he could just going on exposing more details. He doesn't have to do things in the legal arena (after all with Binay his chosen venue was the Senate and not the courts). Also, even if the documents he's using are fake, he's not liable for any sort of perjury unless he uses them as documentary evidence in a court proceeding with full knowledge that they are fake (which he will never admit!)

It's obviously a targetted attack, but regardless of his intentions, at the very least it has already exposed two things: (1) further evidence of the mayor's inconsistency in giving public statements (day one the account doesn't exist, day two it does exist but not with that amount); and (2) the apparently hypocritical insincerity of the earlier call to open up candidates' bank accounts
