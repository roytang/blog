As promised, here's a spreadsheet of compiled information on the senatorial candidates for 2016: https://docs.google.com/.../1aSEj5wnFbYKNhho8H0Ur.../edit...

(Ang effort magcompile, I'll try to update it when I get new info or whatever, but I think it's more or less set na)

Suggestion: If you are having trouble narrowing down your choices (unlikely! I'm not sure I can even get 12 candidates), prioritize those who are lower ranked in the surveys to improve their chances of pushing out the undesirables

The link is publicly viewable feel free to share

Edit 4/25 11:50pm: Added a few details for 5 candidates newly added to the UP Polsoc profiles last 4/20
