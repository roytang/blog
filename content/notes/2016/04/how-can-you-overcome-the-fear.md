Fear is often overcome by facing the fear repeatedly until you are so used to what you are afraid of that the fear goes away. Fear is a primal instinct meant to keep us alive, but many times that instinct is not justified. You need to learn to understand when fear is keeping you safe and when fear is holding you back.

For your specific fear, I'm not clear exactly what you mean by unsafe. If your fear is keeping you from entering unsafe conditions, i.e. maybe your fear is stopping you from moving in to a bad neighborhood known for a high crime rate, that fear might be justified and it's ok. But if your fear is unjustified, it can be unhealthy. i.e. if you fear flying because you think it's unsafe (despite the fact that thousands of planes take off and land each day without incident), that's irrational
