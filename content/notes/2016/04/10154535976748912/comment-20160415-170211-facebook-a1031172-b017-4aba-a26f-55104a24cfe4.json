  "text": "If you want to take poverty into account, then it's even stranger that crime is such a national issue here given that poverty incidence is higher compared to the US (I assume, I didn't bother researching this one). Lower crime rate and higher poverty rate means that politicians running for national office should be focusing more on poverty alleviation which would as a secondary effect reduce crime   Citing Mexico specifically is interesting, since they are also ahead of us in crime rate in the above two links (right about in the middle of us and the United States) AND has almost double the homicide rate as we do. The high crime rate in Mexico is largely because it serves as a transit point for drug syndicates moving product between Latin America and the US.  Anyway, if you complain that comparing certain countries is apples to oranges because those countries have different circumstances, it means we never get to compare any countries at all since no two countries really have the same background, history, geographical features, population size and distribution etc. Then we don't get to have any fun discussions!",
