  "text": "It is still very helpful no matter what. You claim that it might not mean a lot to compare ourselves to the US. We hold first world countries as benchmarks don't we? We refer to their health policies, their safety nets. Yes, comparing ourselves to a successful third world is just as helpful. But Our system of checks and balances came from the US.  The presence of strong held beliefs and traditions should not stop us from looking outside the box. Why look at just third world countries? Why just look at places similar to ours?",
