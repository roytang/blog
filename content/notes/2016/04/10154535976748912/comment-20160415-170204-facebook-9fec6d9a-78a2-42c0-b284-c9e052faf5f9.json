  "text": "Not sure if it means a lot to compare a first to a third world country (apples and oranges), and we are not even considering education and the cultural factors that influence crime. I'd say look at how Mexico is now, and how analysts say that its current state could have been prevented if the national government intervened. In terms of Spanish heritage we are about the same, but not as bad (yet?) in terms of crime.",
