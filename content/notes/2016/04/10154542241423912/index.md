   There is no sufficient excuse or explanation for what was said. I am one of many who demand for an apology for what is a tasteless, crass joke that may seem inconsequential
  </span>
  <wbr/>
  <span class="word_break">

  to many. It promotes rape culture and there is no good enough explanation for that.
 </p>
 <p>
  As I have said to my team, we are not apologists and spin doctors. We will not explain nor spin this story to fit our goals. We will hold our candidate accountable for his words and actions.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am personally offended, frustrated, and disappointed. I expect and demand so much more from him.
 </p>
 <p>
  Will this stop me from voting and supporting him? No. I do not always agree with him and many times these past few months I have mulled about quitting. But I will still vote for him and support him.
 </p>
 <p>
  No, I am not a retard. I am not blind or deaf or callous.
 </p>
 <p>
  The sad truth is he is the best candidate. I call this a sad truth because we deserve better. We deserve candidates so good, so accomplished, so untarnished that we ask ourselves who is the best of the best not who is the lesser evil.
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, there is no space for my personal feelings in these elections. Sa dami
  <br/>
  ng nagugutom, namamatay, nananakawan, at napapabayaan, I have to accept that this is our sad truth. That we have to campaign for the best candidate who is not perfect or infallible. That we have to work with somebody who refuses to be coached or to filter his words.
 </p>

   Because no matter how much I disagree with him and no matter how much he offends me, he is the only one I would trust with my life and the future of this nation. Siya lang ang mapagkakatiwala
  </span>

  <span class="word_break">

   an ko na kikilos para sa kabutihan ng nakakarami. Siya lang ang kilala kong susunod sa batas kahit di siya sang ayon dito. At siya lang ang mapagkakatiwala

   an ko na di lulustayin ang perang pinaghirapan ng mga mamamayang Pilipino. Kahit na minsan masama ang ugali niya at di katanggap-tangg

  an ko siya. Iboboto ko siya. Tutulungan ko siyang ihalal pero di ibig sabihin tanga, bulag, at bingi ako. Dahil sa akin at sa sambayanang Pilipino siya may utang na loob. Kaya bawat isa sa atin may karapatan na kwestyunin siya. Each one of us has the right to expect more, to demand more.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kaya heto ako... Asking my candidate to transcend, to apologize, to promise, to change for the better.
 </p>
 <p>
  Mayor Rody, please lang po... Magbago na tayo. Dahan-dahan po sa pananalita. Di po masamang magbiro pero sana po isipin din natin na may mga taong nasasaktan. I demand more. I expect more from you Sir.
