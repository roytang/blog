  My observations of the four presidential candidates and the general audience they appeal to:
 </p>
 <p>
  1. Grace Poe appeals to the hopeful. To them, she sells dreams. In it are visions of her beloved father because his spirit is our guiding light. Champion of the oppressed - she promises leadership that is compassionate and a government that keeps its ears close to the people. Under a Poe presidency, we all have a say because inclusiveness is the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  2. Mar Roxas appeals to the realist. To them, he sells numbers and facts. Realists believe that progress cannot be accomplished within the confines of a singular presidency, that nobody's perfect, and that in order for lasting change to take effect - we have to stay the course.  Under a Roxas presidency, continuity is the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  3. Rodrigo Duterte appeals to the angry. To them, he sells action. These people are sick and tired of the current system, which is the same as (or worse than) all that came before it. He is the by-product of a frustrated populace who feel like our institutions need a good and solid kick in the ass. Under a Duterte presidency - change is the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  4. Jejomar Binay appeals to the hopeless. He doesn't have to sell anything. The hopeless believe that regardless of who becomes president nothing is going to change. Everyone lies, everyone cheats, everyone steals - so better the devil you know than the devil you don't. "I'm tried and tested, you know what you're getting," he says. Under a Binay presidency - familiarity is the key.
 </p>
 <p>
  Yup, one of them gets to lead the country.
