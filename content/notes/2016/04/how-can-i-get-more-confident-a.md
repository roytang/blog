Confidence really only comes with experience. The reason senior developers are able to handle pressure so easily is that they've been under the gun many times and know how to focus and deliver even under strict deadlines. I suggest just putting in the best work you can, be helpful to your team as much as possible. Respect will come naturally to those who put in good work
