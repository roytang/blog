> [Is there a way to move forward in a line without the person behind you moving the same distance?](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-way-to-move-forward-in-a-line-without-the-person-behind-you-moving-the-same-distance/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Step forward such that you end up facing sideways. Leave one of your legs slightly behind you, then lean forward. The leg will give you additional space between you and the person behind.</p></span>
