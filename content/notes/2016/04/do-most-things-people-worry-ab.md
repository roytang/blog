<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Yeah. It's partly because the media overhypes some things. One of the best examples is terrorism - terrorism is terrible of course and many lives are lost. But the truth is many more lives are lost to everyday occurrences like car accidents as compared to terrorist attacks. It's just that terrorist attacks are more sensationalized (which is kind of what terrorists want) so people are more outraged by them</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's also partly because people tend to rely on how they feel emotionally rather than thinking rationally about how likely certain worries really are. It's like mothers who are overprotective of their children and don't want them running around the playground with strange kids because they might get hurt, when really kids have been playing outdoors for ages and ages and most of the time it's fine.</p></span>
