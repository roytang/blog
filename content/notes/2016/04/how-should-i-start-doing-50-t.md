Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [How should I start doing 50+ tasks I should have done long time ago (some are small while some are complicated and very time consuming)?](https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-start-doing-50+-tasks-I-should-have-done-long-time-ago-some-are-small-while-some-are-complicated-and-very-time-consuming/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Make a list, then do them one at a time. Do the more important things first. Intersperse small and large tasks where possible.</p></span>
