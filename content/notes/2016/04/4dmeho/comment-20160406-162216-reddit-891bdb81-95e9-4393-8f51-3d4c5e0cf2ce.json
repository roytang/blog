  "text": "Vader says \"the power of the force,\" not \"the power of Jedi or Sith.\" So even if there aren't any force users causing destruction on this scale, he is referring to the force itself, which were are told is omnipresent and \"binds the galaxy together.\" Almost like saying to people who are in awe of man's ability to create the atom bomb that their accomplishment is insignificant next to the power of God. I always thought the line was kind of awkward and irrelevant. It makes Vader seem like a single-minded zealot, which we don't really see elsewhere in the movies.",
