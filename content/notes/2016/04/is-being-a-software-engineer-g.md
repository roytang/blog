<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you love it that's great. It's a rare gift to be able to love something that also happens to be a skill that can net you a high-paying job/career. The thing about software development is that there is actually a wide scope within the field that makes your concerns moot. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Do you want more free time? There are jobs that offer flexible hours, working from home, etc, or you could just go freelance and control your own hours.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Want to avoid working for a company that feels like a prison? While there are companies that can be like that, there are also many companies that are better. And good programmers are always in high demand, so as long as you have sufficient competence and skill, you should be able to find better working conditions.</p></span>
