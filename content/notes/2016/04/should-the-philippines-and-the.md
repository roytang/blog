> [Should the Philippines and the US take Scarborough Shoal since it is near Subic Bay?](https://www.quora.com/Should-the-Philippines-and-the-US-take-Scarborough-Shoal-since-it-is-near-Subic-Bay/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Taking it by force entails too many risks and will very likely escalate tensions making a bad situation worse. I think the current approach being taken - pressuring China to let up on its illegal activities and gathering support from other nations and going through the arbitration case - are much safer bets in the long term.</p></span>
