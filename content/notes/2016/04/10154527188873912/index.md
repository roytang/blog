A modern day parable for the Philippines:

Mark Jr. appears before the board of directors of bank. He is applying to be their CEO.

Director A: So, why should we hire you?

Mark Jr: I have a lot of good plans for the bank, I plan to (blah, blah, blah)

Director B: Wow, this guy sounds really good! He has some good plans! We should hire him!

Director A: Wait a minute. (Looking at Mark Jr's resume). It says here you're the son of the Mark Sr?

Mark Jr: Yes, so?

Director A: Mark Sr stole billions from this bank when he was the CEO!

Director B: Really? I wasn't around then.

Mark Jr: That's not true! My father's wealth was legitimate!

Director A: There were court decisions ordering him to pay back the money!

Director B: Well, we can't really fault him for the sins of his father right?

Mark Jr: What he said! That was a long time ago, I was still young then. I had nothing to do with it!

Director A: You were already 20 years old at that time! Your father hired you as his assistant, how could you have nothing to do with it?

Mark Jr: I'm not the one who was convicted right?

Director A: Will you at least apologize for your father's crimes?

Mark Jr: Why should I apologize? I can only apologize for myself.

Director A: But you admit he stole from this bank?

Mark Jr: The court already decided about that, we should just move on.

Director B: I agree, that's the past. We should be excited about this guy's plans for the bank

Director A: Wait a minute, your family hasn't given back the money your father stole yet. You should give it back!

Mark Jr: I cannot give what I do not have!

Director A: Aren't you the executor of your father's estate?

Mark Jr: Hey let's look to the future ok, not the past

Director B: I think we should give this guy a chance. Look at his father's record, he did some good stuff for the bank before he stole the money.

Director A: (glares at Director B like he's an idiot)

If it were you, would you hire Mark Jr?
