#### Posted on r/Philippines: [2016 Senatorial Candidates Information Megathread](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4fdl1h/2016_senatorial_candidates_information_megathread/)

Hello /r/Philippines!

As we all know, the presidential and vice-presidential races are quite controversial and getting a lot of attention. This leads to the Senate race getting less attention and comparably less information is available about the senatorial candidates. The senators matter too, since they affect the legislative agenda and may also run for higher office in the future.

I was thinking that maybe we as a community might help put together some information on the candidates to help us voters decide who to include in our ballots come election day.

Here's what I propose: I'll post a comment below for each of the senatorial candidates, along with a short summary of what party they are running under and what positions they have held previously and a link to their wikipedia article, if any. Feel free to upvote candidates you support, but please don't downvote candidates you dislike (that's not how the ballots work after all!)

Then let's reply to each comment with more information about each candidate, whether pro or con. Please note that some positions may be held which are pro for some voters yet con for others. Please be respectful of the others'  opinions! I have to admit I don't have too much information yet about many of them, but I'll try to add what I can as well!

Edit: Whew, ang effort ilagay lahat, over 50 candidates! I had a script to generate the comment for each one but it turns out I had to edit individually dahil sa reddit formatting. Sana hindi masayang ang effort hehe. I'll take a break first and try to provide any additional info later.

Edit: Wow, reddit gold! Haha thanks. A helpful redditor also provided the following resource on Facebook: 

> UP Polis (UP Political Science Society) has a great photo set featuring the senatorial candidates on Facebook. You may check it here: https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10153957220613374.1073741974.242541193373&type=3

I've posted the links to the individual profiles in the thread of each candidate (they don't have a complete set yet though)

Edit 4/21: Even though I said let's not downvote the top-level posts, of course meron pa din. Sorry guys, it can't be helped (not everybody reads the instructions). The mods tried setting the thread to contest mode (so that the scores aren't visible), but sadly nagka-issue where nung enabled ang contest mode, hindi na visible lahat ng comments, which was a worse outcome. So we have to live with this (unless someone has a better solution). If you want to see the candidates with negative votes, just expand the top-level comments.

/u/LeaderOfDragons has kindly added Imgur mirrors for the UP Polsoc profiles for those who could not view them before.

Edit 4/25: I've also summarized what info we have available in a spreadsheet for easy sharing to nonredditors: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aSEj5wnFbYKNhho8H0UrNnB4JMCzfQoa01SbYOrl4RI/edit?usp=sharing
Obviously there was some editorial discretion in deciding what would appear in the spreadsheet, please PM me if you feel something may be unfair or have been left out.
