It would be hard to separate BBM from FEM for the reason you mentioned, he is the executor of the Marcos estate, which means he&#x27;s still holding (and most probably using!) the money they stole from the Filipinos. There&#x27;s evidence that they have no plans of giving it back (e.g. US Supreme Court contempt ruling if I am correct) so no, I don&#x27;t think anyone should separate BBM from the FEM issue.",
