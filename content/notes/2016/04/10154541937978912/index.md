Yes, I watched the whole video. I know that he's a brave son of a bitch willing to let himself take the place of hostages and that he killed all the rapists. Hooray for him.

No, I still don't want him to be president. I wouldn't want Rambo to be president either. But that's me. If you're voting for him, that's fine, ikaw bahala. But that doesn't mean tatanggapin mo na lang na hindi nya kailangan mag-apologize. Hint: Pwede mag-acknowledge ng flaws and still vote for him..

No, it doesn't excuse the rape joke. It doesn't excuse trivializing rape. Saying na ganun talaga magsalita ang mga lalaki trivializes rape (I hope I don't have to say this, but hindi ako ganun magsalita). It trivializes rape. Saying that your rival candidate is not rapeable trivializes rape. Saying that heroic deeds excuse rape jokes trivializes rape. Claiming that he said it in anger doesn't excuse it (it makes it worse). Repeating the joke for cheap laughs during political gatherings? Trivializes rape.

Saying the other canddiates have also said terrible if not worse things does not excuse it.

What would have been a better response? "I'm sorry for my poor choice of words. I'm sorry for repeating those words during political rallies. Rape is never a laughing matter, no matter what the context. Real men should never look at any woman with thoughts of rape. I ask all my supporters not to speak this way about women. I will try not to speak this way again."

But we're not going to get that response. That's the kind of person he is.
