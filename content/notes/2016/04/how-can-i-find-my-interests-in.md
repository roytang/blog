<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Look everywhere. Try everything. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Life is varied and has a wider scope than you could possibly imagine. Step outside your comfort zone. Visit new places. Sign up for strange classes. Go down roads you don't normally follow. Walk into new stores you've never visited. Eat at new restaurants with cuisine you've never tried before. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Talk to new people. Ask them about that cool thing they just did. Ask them what they do for a living. Ask them what interesting thing happened to them last week. Ask them how they met their SO. Ask them who was the coolest person they knew. Try to meet that person too.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Learn new skills. Develop new hobbies. Watch new tv shows. Read more books. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Live, live, live.</p></span>
