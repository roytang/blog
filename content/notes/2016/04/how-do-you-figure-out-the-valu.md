<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It is a form of self-awareness, which can come only with contemplating yourself and your actions. Look at how you live your life. Which things do you prioritize, which principles do you adhere to? What actions do you respond to well? What actions do you respond to poorly? e.g. If you respond poorly to people lying, maybe you strongly value honesty and integrity. If you respond well to people who make intelligent discussion points maybe you value cerebral thinking</p></span>
