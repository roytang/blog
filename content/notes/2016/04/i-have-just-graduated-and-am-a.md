Don't waste your time worrying about people who aren't helping you grow.

Develop an attitude towards learning and discovering new things.

Be kind and understanding to people, even assholes.

Every so often, walk down an unfamiliar road.

Tell your family and friends how much you appreciate them.

Exercise at least a little bit every day.

Try to improve some aspect of your life by 1% every day.

Thank people who help you and help others in return.

Don't be seduced by pretty appearances or the lure of easy money.

Don't insist on helping people who don't want to be helped.

Don't compromise yourself for the sake of other people.
