> [Do software engineers get better at programming with age?](https://www.quora.com/Do-software-engineers-get-better-at-programming-with-age/answer/Roy-Tang)


<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Not necessarily. Programmers get better with practice, good experience, and an attitude for learning.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The reason young talent is prized over old talent is that older talent tends to expect a lot more pay, and nonprogrammers typically don't understand how much valuable a good, experienced programmer is.</p></span>
