Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Can understanding about life improve the ability to enjoy it better?](https://www.quora.com/Can-understanding-about-life-improve-the-ability-to-enjoy-it-better/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I think so. I think that some level of introspection or self-awareness is important in making the most of your life, identifying the things that are not good for you, identifying the things you want, etc. The more you understand your own life, the easier will it be for you to focus it towards directions that lead to growth and happiness</p></span>
