Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Do clever people really know as much as they seem?](https://www.quora.com/Do-clever-people-really-know-as-much-as-they-seem/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There are people who know as much as they seem, and there are people who don't. There are people who know the tricks to look clever, but they can easily be exposed as fakers if you're willing to dig a little deeper (which usually means only people who are genuinely clever/knowledgable can call them out!)</p></span>
