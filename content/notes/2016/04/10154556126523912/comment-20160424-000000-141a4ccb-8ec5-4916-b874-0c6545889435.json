        "text": "I had a talk with somebody about not having the luxury of voting on  principle given the present choices. She was pretty convincing. I went down from 100% abstain to 80%-ish abstain.    Miriam was also a serious choice for me, health isn't an issue. Bad trip lang yung BBM connection (although when I talked with my dad and mentioned Du30 his immediate reaction was something along the lines of \"kilala mo ba tatay nun?\" I believe he was talking about the dad being a Marcos crony? I dunno.)    Just wondering, did she get dull or was it the Big C (and/or the meds)?",

For me lang, I'm not taking issue with her health because anybody could die soon anyway.  Nobody thought FPJ was going to die within a year of the 04 elections, so had he won, Noli De Castro would've been president until 2010.  Nobody saw that coming.",
