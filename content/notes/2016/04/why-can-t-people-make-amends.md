Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Why can't people make amends?](https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-people-make-amends/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There are many reasons, but the most common is probably pride. They don't want to admit that maybe they were wrong or at least partially responsible for any rift. This pride may manifest in making up reasons not to make amends ("I don't need him, etc")</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, there are valid reasons for letting go of a friendship and not bothering to make amends. One is if a friendship is not good/healthy for you, for example if the friend is a bad influence, or he is always hurting you and taking advantage of you. In such cases, not making amends and just letting go of the friendship is understandable</p></span>
