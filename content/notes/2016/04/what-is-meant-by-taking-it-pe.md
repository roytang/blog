Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [What is meant by "taking it personally"?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-taking-it-personally/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">When a person is said to take something personally, it means that person considers something to be directly affecting his ego and reflecting upon him as a person. For example, if you try to refute a person's arguments and he takes it personally, it means he gets offended by your counter-argument as if you were attacking him as a person instead of just his arguments. Or taking one's work personally means if there's a problem with your work you think there's a problem with you as person.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Not taking things personally means being able to detach ourselves from the things we interact with.</p></span>
