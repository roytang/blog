Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [How do you know what to do with your life if you don't know what you want in life?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-know-what-to-do-with-your-life-if-you-dont-know-what-you-want-in-life/answer/Roy-Tang)


A vast majority of people in the world don't really know what to do in life or what they want in life. They/we all just kind of stumble along to where life takes us. Many people take up a degree in college only because they believe that course will lead them to a good job, so they can get promoted to a high position, get married, raise a family, etc. Most people are on this "default path" that society provides instead of figuring out what they really want to do or where their passions lie. Many people live their entire lives not finding a passion or what they want in life.

So don't worry too much if you are finding it difficult to find out what you want in life, because most people are in that state. The difference between you and other people is you are aware of it, that you want more in life but are not yet sure what that something is. 

Explore life. Say yes to more random encounters. Take up new opportunities when they appear. Increase the scope of your activities. Do all these things to increase the odds that you will be able to find and figure out what you want in life.
