Good Montesquieu quote: "If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people, and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are." 

But most notable is that he wrote this in the early 1700s. We live in a world that would be totally unrecognizable to Montesquieu, and yet the people are exactly the same.
