Read to him often and encourage him to read by buying him books appropriate to his age. Instill a love of reading into him.

Teach him to be kind, and to share, and to help people. 

Give him some small, minor chores like picking up his own clothes. Teach him to be responsible for his own messes by asking him to help clean up.
