Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [Do you think being smart is a gift or a curse?](https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-being-smart-is-a-gift-or-a-curse/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It can be a little bit of both, depending on how you use it and how you view life. Don't let being smart make you full of yourself. As long as you approach life with an attitude of there being much more to learn and discover, it's hard to go wrong no matter how smart you are.</p></span>
