  "text": "Once again, I'll bite.\n\nHave you tried doing a different approach instead of spewing blind hate posts?\n\nWhy not post about how federalism would in fact be better for our country? Why not counter its inherent weaknesses as a political system? Why not argue how the death penalty would in fact deter crime, as supported by your own candidate? Why not argue why making peace with the leftists would be beneficial in the end for the country? Why not argue na your candidate isnt pandering the north by siding with BBM?\n\n\"Bakit ko gagawin yan magsasayang lang ako ng effort kasi ddownvote lang yan ng mga ulol na tulad mo\"  - feel ko yan irereply mo. So uunahan na kita. Sinubukan mo na ba? Iyak ka ng iyak kasi dinadownvote ka tapos cclaim mo kasi di kami sumasangayon sa pananaw mo eh di mo nga mapaliwanag ng maayos kung bakit dyan ka naniniwala. Most of the \"Yellowtards\" here actually post facts based on data. Eh ikaw? Puro paninira lang naman ang inatupag mo based on what? False information? Memes? \n\n",
