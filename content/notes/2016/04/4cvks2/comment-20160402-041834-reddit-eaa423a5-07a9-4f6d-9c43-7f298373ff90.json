  "text": "> As to sa missing LTO plates, ano pa ba ang mapaguusapan dun?\n\nJust one of the many example of this sub.  \nCan you not see the lack of anti-government propaganda in the front page.  \nWhile shitpost about Binay and facebook re-post images are always on top.  \n\n> I do not blame this sub for dubbing Duterte supporters retards because so far yan ang pinapakita eh\n\nBecause back in the day, last year to be exact, people who are trying to be level headed are always downvoted as long as it doesn't agree with the hivemind, while the top post are one liner calling names like \"Lol Dutertards on facebook blah blah blah..\".\n\nThey even created a sub specific for politics for this, but as expected, it's a name calling trollfest sub. \n\nMost people get tired with this and move on.  \nMe, I just enjoy calling out Mar's incompetency given the chance ha ha ha.
