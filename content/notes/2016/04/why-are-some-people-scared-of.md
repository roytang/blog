> [Why are some people scared of disabled people?](https://www.quora.com/Why-are-some-people-scared-of-disabled-people/answer/Roy-Tang)


People don't always react well to people they perceive as different from them. It is born of a primal fear of things that are unknown, i.e. in the olden caveman days you had to be wary of every unknown thing since it might be a dangerous predator. This fear can be hard to overcome unless the person willingly recognizes it and acts to change it. Your acquaintance may not realize it, but he is probably scared that you will do something unusual or awkward and he won't know what to do or how to respond. 

I would suggest just telling him that you're just like every other person: you have some unusual quirks that takes some getting used to. Everyone is like that! But if he doesn't want to hang out with you, you have to respect that and just look for better friends who can be more understanding.
