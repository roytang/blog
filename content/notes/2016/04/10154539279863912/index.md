This law won't change everything overnight (and might not even be enforced very well), but it's a good start. And if more LGUs follow, more people are likely to take notice and think "Hey, hindi pala maganda ito", and more children will be asking their parents bakit may ganung mga tao. It won't be enough to change those already set in their ways (unless enforcement is really good), but it increases the odds that we raise a new generation devoid of such mentality

  Warning: This is a very long post.
 </p>
 <p>
  I shared this post before. I’ll post about it again because some guy just commented this:
 </p>
 <p>
  "If you biatches don't want attention, then don't objectify yourselves by wearing skimpy clothes.
 </p>
 <p>
  You say you dress for yourselves? ULUL. You dress for guys.
 </p>
 <p>
  Hirap sa inyo, pag pangit ang nagbigay pansin sa inyo, you feel offended and shout "harrassment" samantalang pag guwapo ang pumansin sa inyo, laglag mga panty ninyo at kinikilig kayo at magpapa-cute pa talaga para lumapit ang lakake.
 </p>
 <p>
  Gago."
 </p>
 <p>
  Here's what I have to say about the matter.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was 10, a man suddenly stopped in front of me and put down his pants while smiling at me maliciously. I didn't have boobs then, didn't have anything sexual about me, and I was wearing a loose shirt and pajamas.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was 14, a man I didn't know started touching my thighs. I was on my way home from school. I was wearing a white polo and a long skirt that reached way below my knees. During the same year, another dude again tried to harass me inside the jeepney by trying to touch my breasts. This time, I was wearing my PE uniform, so no, it wasn't skimpy. It wasn't even fitted. I was wearing a fucking loose jogging pants and shirt. And yet, those men did that to me. On both occasions, I tried to fight back. Multiple times I tried to stop their hands from reaching me, but they were too strong, and I was too scared to ask for help from the other passengers. Because (1) what if those other passengers do not try to help and (2) He’s a man, I’m a little girl, what if he gets mad? What else might he do to me?
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was 15, I was walking along Freedom Park on my way to a group project. It was hot so I wore shorts (knee level) and again, a t-shirt (sobrang wala akong sense of fashion noon shirt at pants lang talaga wardrobe ko). A group of young boys about my age started whistling and saying "Hi miss. Wag kang snob". I tried ignoring them, but they followed me until I was finally able to ride a jeep. I was scared.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was 16, I wore a dress because there was a photoshoot in school. I was feeling quite good about myself. For the first time, I felt pretty. But it felt good not because I thought “Uy feeling ko ang ganda ko mapapansin ako ng iba.” NO. Sometimes, women just like feeling pretty for themselves. But then that feeling was ruined when some driver suddenly whistled and told me “Ate itaas mo nga patingin.” And his companions started yelling “whoooo go ate itataas na yan”. I dressed up because I needed to. I never dressed up for him, or for other men like him.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that, it took me a very long time before I decided to wear a dress to school again.
 </p>
 <p>
  When I was 18, a man I didn’t know put his arm around me, put a gun against my waist, and tried to drag me God knows where. When I finally filed a blotter case after the whole incident, the theory was that those men were going to rape me, since that’s what happened to the cases before. One of the first questions they asked me was, “Ano bang suot mo?” I was wearing a loose shirt, pants, and rubber shoes.
 </p>
 <p>
  I could tell you about all the times I’ve been harassed.
  <br/>
  And I could tell you about all the times society has failed me when I tried to ask for help.
  <br/>
  The list is almost endless. I’m not sure if that’s just because I’m a woman or malas lang talaga ako in life.
 </p>
 <p>
  To Jigs Arquiza:
 </p>
 <p>
  Here’s the thing. You say women just call out harassment when the guys who do that are ugly. Not true. I’ve been harassed by guys who are good looking, guys who are cute, guys who are popular, and I am telling you now, there’s no difference, no difference at all. You say women are catcalled because of what they wear. On multiple occasions I was harassed despite being fully covered. You say women should not complain about catcalling because if we don’t want to be catcalled, we shouldn’t be ‘looking for attention’. Men catcall with or without us ‘looking for attention’, whatever that means. I know because I never looked for the attention of my harassers, yet I was still victimized by them.
 </p>
 <p>
  So fuck you.
 </p>
 <p>
  Fuck you for calling women biatches.
  <br/>
  Fuck you for thinking that women dress up for men. You might also think women wear make up for men, no? Wake up, dude. Ganun talaga kataas tingin mo sa mga tulad mo? Na para kaming mga hayop na hayok na hayok lagi na mapansin nyo? Not everything is about your gender. NOT EVERYHING IS FOR MEN. AND YOU DON’T HAVE THE RIGHT TO EVERYTHING EITHER, ESPECIALLY THE RIGHT TO US, WOMEN.
  <br/>
  Fuck you for thinking women are only calling for attention. GANUN BA KALIIT UTAK MO. SA TINGIN MO BA HIHILINGIN NG KAHIT SINONG BABAE ANG MAYAYA NG SEX, MAHIPUAN, MACATCALL OUT OF THE BLUE. WOMEN DO NOT NEED YOUR ATTENTION. Hindi namin kayo kelangan. Sige fine, maybe sometimes women dress for others (ie a date w/ a special someone, a job interview, family gatherings), pero definitely not for people they do not know, people who will not compliment them; people who will instead make them feel degraded. So sige, naghahanap na ng atensyon. Thing is, hindi atensyon mo ang hinahanap, and siguro naman gets mo yun unless ganun ka kawalang utak, so in the end WALA PA RING RIGHT ANG KAHIT SINONG LALAKI NA BASTA ICATCALL ANG KUNG SINO SINONG BABAE.
  <br/>
  Fuck you for saying, “Gago” in your comment. As if ikaw pa yung agrabyado. Ikaw pa ata yung naoffend. Di ko alam kung bitter ka lang siguro may nililigawan ka before tapos yung sinagot mas gwapo sayo kaya ganyan sentiments mo. Or nangstalk ka ng someone, nacreepyhan si ate gurl kaya badtrip ka ngayon. Pero eto lang kuya ha, kung matino kang lalaki, magegets mo na regardless of your looks you are not entitled na mangmanyak ang iba. You will never be entitled to objectifying women regardless of what they wear or what their lifestyle is. Sige sabihin nating may kakilala ka na nageenjoy pag gwapo yung nangmanyak sakanya. If that’s the case, WAG MONG IGENERALIZE LAHAT NG BABAE.
 </p>
 <p>
  Last but not the least,
  <br/>
  I pity you.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pity Jigs Arquiza. I pity all guys who think like him.
  <br/>
  I pity all guys who think women exist for men’s amusement.
  <br/>
  I pity all guys who believe women only live to entertain them
  <br/>
  I pity all who believe women are objects when they dress a certain way, drink a little too much, live a certain lifestyle.
  <br/>
  I pity guys who think that everything women do is for men.
  <br/>
  I pity you because you are still tied to the medieval way of thinking. Because you are still a prisoner of the patriarchy. Because you still believe the gender stereotypes. Because you, obviously, have not even tried to understand the woes of the opposite gender, and that is why you are so clueless right now.
 </p>
 <p>
  I pity you because you know nothing about the reality of this problem. You are living in this fantasy world of yours where slut shaming and victim blaming is normal, rape culture is okay, and men are good, men can do what they want with women, especially if women are this and that. You are living in a world where women can be objectified, and should be objectified, if they do not meet your standards of what a respectable woman should be. I pity that, because with that viewpoint, you will never be able to understand and truly love the women that will come into your life. You will always view them according to these standards. How problematic and sad that must be.
 </p>
 <p>
  For all the men in this world, try to see that we are not the problem. Women living their lives are not a problem. Women living their lives not centered around you is not a problem. Women learning to embrace who they are is not a problem. We are also humans like you. All we ask is that you recognize that too. Please, please help us stop living in fear. Help us in our battle against sexual harassment. This is not only for us. This is also for your mothers, your sisters, you future wives, and daughters, and may even be for your sons as well. Sexual harassment is a battle that does not only affect women. It affects each and every one of us.
 </p>
 <p>
  P.S. Sa lahat ng manyak na kahit anong paliwanag at pakiusap mo di pa rin mababago isip at ikakatwiran pa na “lalaki kami” kaya okay lang sa kanila mangmanyak at mangbastos, kasama na rin mga close minded na idedefend pa mga ganung lalaki at kahit paliwanagan mo wala talaga (GANUN KAYO KAKATI AT KABASTOS??), pakyu po.
