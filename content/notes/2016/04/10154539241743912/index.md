ON BEHALF OF MY SISTER IN CHRIST, MISSIONARY JACQUELINE HAMILL, I PUBLICLY DENOUNCE THE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY OF DUTERTE, IN THE PHILIPPINES.  Jacqueline was raped and had her throat slit while ministering in the jails in southern Philippines in a 1989 hostage taking.  Duterte was recorded this week saying in his political rally that while he ordered the killing of the hostage takers while he was mayor, he wished he could have raped her first, since she was so beautiful. Looking back on this photo, I realize ministering in jails as a woman is very risky and looks outright naive, like the "you got what was coming to you" mentality that is prevalent today.  But all ministry and everyday LIFE is a big risk, and we must be obedient to the voice of the spirit of God, even if it leads us to death.  Jacqueline's death affected me deeply personally, as I had been visiting just about every jail in Manila with the ACTION/CGM teams from 1986-89.  I couldn't yet speak the language but I could play the flute and just show love to people in horrible situations. LOVE TRUMPS HATE. DON'T STOP LOVING.  DON'T VOTE FOR PEOPLE who speak vile things against WOMEN!! We are ALL made in the Image of God!!

(Note: My name is Robin but I am a woman, not a man, not related to Jacqueline, and I did not work with her.  I was a missionary at the same time as her, in Manila. The photograph is of myself-playing the flute-and colleagues from ACTION/CGM)
