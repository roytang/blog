  "text": "When you pause during your own block string on offense and walk forward or backwards it sometimes can cause players to habitually throw tech.  When you tech a throw, you're teching it based on your opponent's spacing, not by literally seeing and reacting to the throw itself.  The pause and walk forward and/or back during a block string is referred to as a \"shimmy\" and is a throw bait technique.  You use it to bait a throw and then whiff punish the whiffed throw.  Players at lower level rank (bronze and silver) don't often have a shimmy game, they just do various attacks and tick throws during their block strings, so throws don't get baited.\n\nIf you want to defend well just block and throw tech smartly.  Like, people at your level only GO for a tick throw, a shimmy is basically a fake tick throw.  No one fakes tick throw until gold in my experience.\n\nA tick throw by the way is doing an attack on block then walking forward and throwing.  A classic shimmy is doing an attack on block, walking forward to fake the throw, then walking backwards to get the throw tech to whiff, and then reactively whiff punishing that whiffed throw tech.",
