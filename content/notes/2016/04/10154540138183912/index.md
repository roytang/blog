Minsan lang ako magpost about politics, but here's the thing about Duterte's recent controversy that to me seems to get lost in this madness. What he meant might not probably matter. Whether it was a joke or not is probably immaterial. The apology or non-apology probably won't change anything. The issue with moral standards will largely depend on the voter's own take on what is "moral". But he's far too careless with his words carrying his own brand of bravado. And as a prospective head of state, that's a very very very dangerous thing in terms of foreign diplomacy. He can't just go "fuck you China" one day and say "loljk" the next and expect everything to be fine. Trump can afford a bit of that because America is a fairly strong country. The Philippines cannot. And it baffles me why people aren't particularly worried about how Duterte will actually represent the Philippines in the international stage. 

I'm fine with people voting for him; I have tons of friends who have and who will vote for him. But please understand he's not some kind of savior for the country. He has his warts (a lot of them in fact). Don't just dismiss those as though they don't matter. They do. And people should be bothered by those things.
