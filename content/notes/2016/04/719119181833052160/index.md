title: "Commentary thread for the vice presidential debate today"
---

---

[18:55] Leni doing well. Calm, composed yet striking hard. Marcos following Binay strategy: deny deny deny #vpdebates

---

[19:05] Apc asking opponents for a plan but when asked to elaborate on their plans: gagalingan lang namin

---

[19:09] Omg this debate. So many savage burns

---

[19:12] APC really hates BBM. Sya kasi ang kaagaw sa duterte supporters

---

[19:15] So far APC, Trillianes, Leni doing well. Chiz and Gringo weak answers. BBM lol

---

[19:21] Leni not shying away from traffic problems. Hits her strong points emphasizing she's a commuter and taga province

---

[19:38] APC coming out strong on traffic/transpo. Leni answered well, not denying delays in infra. Would've been better if she came out vs Abaya

---

[19:46] Leni wasted a lot of time describing the internet problems. APC hitting OFW and oligarchy notes popular with duterte supporters

---

[19:52] APC doing much better than his presidential candidate, always hitting the political will notes whenever infra is discussed and focusing on anecdotal stories of ordinary folk

---

[19:55] Bakit ang sleep inducing ng boses ni Chiz? Parang mas ok na mag orate si Grace

---

[20:15] Grabe chiz wth were you even talking about. Parang estudyante na pinipilit punuin yung 2 page na essay, kulang na lang lakihan yung font

---

[20:17] Leni and BBM gave good answers to the cabinet position question. BBM speaks well (like his father) except when trying to defend his family

---

[20:19] Closing statements:

Leni: Among the 6 of us, may the best woman win <3

Chiz: did he actually say anything? Parang estudyante na pinipilit mapuno yung 2 pages na essay. Kulang na lang lakihan yung font size

APC: All-in na kami dun sa 3-6 months!

---

[20:33] I think Leni and APC performed best in this debate. BBM speaks well but as expected unable to defend his family/martial law. Trillianes medyo ok. Chiz and Gringo weak
