Observation: Over the past 2-3 weeks, my feeds have become increasingly pro-Roxas. There's almost the same amount of pro-Duterte people, but it's like more pro-Roxas people are bothering to speak up now (dati yung mga Duterte lang ang maingay, onti lang yung maingay na Roxas). Dumadami na din yung pro-Miriam. Wala pa ring Poe and Binay lol
