  "text": "Guys. Food for thought. May namatay na ba sa campaign period dahil sa facebook comments?  While I deplore such behaviour, wag tayo matakot.  These are not real threats.  But words of an angry people who has put ALL their hope on this candidate.  Gets?  If you insult my mom, I may punch you on the nose.  Ganun yung logic.  And lets face it too, we are part of the 1% educated elite.  The rest of the country talks in this brute manner.  I dont like it.  I wish it could be more civilized.  But I do get them.  Mahirap buhay kasi.  I am sure we also have our own struggles.  But just imagine how bad it could be for them.  Yun lang po.  Cheers! :)",
