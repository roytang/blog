Ang sakit sa bangs. Not just yung posted na images, but even yung mga comments defending such behavior. Rampant examples of violent mentality, anti-intellectualism/smart-shaming, disrespect for women, and even poor grammar (sorry na, grammar nazi). To my pro-Duterte friends, please reassure me na hindi ganyan ang mga taga-Davao and that pinapaglitan nyo din ang mga supporters pag ganyan sila

Well, I discovered 200++ messages since I posted my campaign against Duterte. Some were respectful and trying to have a good conversation but these...oh my. Can't believe people wish other people to be raped and murdered because of stating one's opinions and facts. Kaloka kayo.
P.S. Nakakatakot ang Pilipinas mas dahil sa inyo. Lagi niyong sinasabi na gusto nito ng disiplina. Congratulations for being such great examples of how you want the Philippines to be.
