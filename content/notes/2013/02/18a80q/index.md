#### Posted on r/civ: [Academy + tile resources question](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/18a80q/academy_tile_resources_question/)

Does having a GS build an Academy add resources on the tile to your trade network? I put an Academy on a Gems tile but I didn't have Mining yet, I assumed I would just get the happiness bonus once I got Mining, but I haven't.
