It's weird to me though that the state of permanent self-fanfiction  is the norm for the big 2 comic companies of the US, while it doesn't actually happen for the other creative industries. There are a fair number of remakes for movies and video games, but for the most part, the majority of stuff is new even for big budget projects. I was going to say for TV too, and then it's like, well, what's on TV other than adaptations of comics, Law and Order, and reality TV... Well... Girls and Downton Abbey?    And yeah, there's plenty of smaller prints and good indie stuff; in some ways those run kind of like manga, except for the lack of digest magazines with episodes.",
