  "text": "It's a mass market problem unfortunately, like you said, too much money involved. They do branch out into new/next generation characters every so often (on the Marvel side there's Runaways, Avengers, Academy, Young Avengers, and the current ongoing Avengers Arena which mixes characters from all of the above) - but the books with new characters almost never sell as well as old favorites. It's a reality, but any reader looking for new stuff has options - even smaller labels like Image, Valiant, etc. are putting out some good work lately (see: Saga). It probably happens to every maturing industry (TV, movies, video games, etc) that the innovation gradually moves out to the smaller/indie side as the industry becomes more mass market.",
