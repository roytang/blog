#### Posted on r/civ: [Civ5 question](https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/18abtf/civ5_question/)

Is there a way to disable those leader messages that I don't really have to respond to? Like when they denounce me, or "I see you've become friends with [country]"? Also the CS popup when you first meet them. It's like those things can just be little notifications on the right side.
