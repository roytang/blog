#### Posted on r/truegaming: [Are RPGs costlier to make than other genres?](https://reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/18ii6h/are_rpgs_costlier_to_make_than_other_genres/)

It seems like there's a lot more assets that are needed given the amount of content typically packed into an RPG. That means a lot more story, characters, items, balancing, models, voices, videos, etc compared to something like an FPS, which translates to higher effort and thus higher costs. Is this a valid assumption? If yes, then why do companies keep making RPGs, are they more profitable than other genres? If no, what other factors go into the cost of other genres?
