#### Posted on r/vita: [Question about the Vita and PS+](https://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/194roe/question_about_the_vita_and_ps/)

I just bought a Vita (yay me!) so I could take advantage of my existing plus subscription. My brother tried it out and he seems interested to get one too, but he's asking me whether we would be able to use the same PSN account on two vitas (so that we both have access to the IGC)?
