#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Is UW Delver well positioned in Standard at the moment?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1b66yz/is_uw_delver_well_positioned_in_standard_at_the/)

I'm planning to play in a WMCQ in a couple of weeks, but I haven't played Standard in a while (like for half a year maybe). I have the shell of a UW Delver deck available (Snapcasters, Restoration Angels, etc) that I can try to fill out until then, but will it have a fighting chance in standard at the moment? 

EDIT: Thanks for the feedback guys, looks like I'll have to look for other options.
