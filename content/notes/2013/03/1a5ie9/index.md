#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Has anyone tried the Marvel Unlimited subscription/ipad app?](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/1a5ie9/has_anyone_tried_the_marvel_unlimited/)

How is reading on the app compared to say, Comixology? 

Looks like a sweet deal, but my problem is I'm offline during 90% of the day (I dont have a data plan) and I heard they only allow 6 offline issues at once. I usually do my reading when I'm out of the house (when waiting in line, etc) so I'm kinda on the fence about subscribing.
