So Globe has this new offer where a prepaid user can customize his promo to control the amount of text, calls, data, etc. he gets under his own budget. Seems like a bad idea to me, given that the vast majority of users will just be confused by the customizability/choices and will just take one of their predefined plans/promos. The only ones who will take advantage would be power users that would optimize it in such a way that Globe would be making minimal money off of them
