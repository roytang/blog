I decided to contribute some money today to Wikipedia's fundraiser. We love getting services for free but it's easy to forget that those services have their own costs that they have to cover somehow. Wikipedia has been an amazing resource for everyone on the internet and I'd hate for it to go down for lack of funds for servers and whatnot. Think about donating to Wikipedia, the minimum donation is only P200
