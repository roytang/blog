  "text": ">If not, then it's seems closer to one person buying it and the second person borrowing the game under the pretext of playing it then using the cross-buy version without permission.\n\nThat's nice, but the rental place is not a person. The rental place is not going to go \"Aw man, dude! I was totally oging to use that!\". The rental place is an entity, a commercial entity. It has lost **nothing.** You can not rent out a digital copy and it is illegal for them to sell the cross buy digital bonus to someone. ",
