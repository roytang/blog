#### Posted on r/truegaming: [Why hasn't Nintendo come out yet with a Mario game that includes a level editor?](https://reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1g33s5/why_hasnt_nintendo_come_out_yet_with_a_mario_game/)

I was playing LBP and I was thinking it would be pretty sweet to have a level editor and community-created levels for a Mario game. It would legitimize all those romhacks that create fun or impossible stages, etc. Why hasn't Nintendo done something like this?
