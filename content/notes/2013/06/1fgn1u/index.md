#### Posted on r/OnePiece: [Question for anyone who's played One Piece: Pirate Warriors (PS3)](https://reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/1fgn1u/question_for_anyone_whos_played_one_piece_pirate/)

Does the story mode cover the entire One Piece manga run? Or just select parts? Or it's an original story?

Also, do you think it would it be better to buy OP:PW (I can probably find a used one somewhere for cheap), or wait for OP:PW2 (being released later this year)?
