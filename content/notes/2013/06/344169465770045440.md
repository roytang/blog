XBox One debuting at $500, a terrible price point. PS4 coming in at $400 or less would blow them away

I could get another couple hours of sleep...or I could just stay up and watch more e3 stuff

So apparently Plants vs Zombies is a third person shooter now #E3

Bah, the stream quality is terrible #E3

Looks like Morrigan's back in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Won't be out til late 2014 though. #E3
