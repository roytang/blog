#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Question about the ending of Daredevil: End of Days (spoilers)](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/1g6nl9/question_about_the_ending_of_daredevil_end_of/)

So in the last book it's revealed what Mapone is referring to. But I don't see the connection to Bullseye and what made him kill himself? Or did I miss it somewhere?
