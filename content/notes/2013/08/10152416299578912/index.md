Abolishing the pork barrel is well and good, but the sociopaths behind large-scale corruption will just find some other flaw in the system to take advantage of. Not just removing the pork barrel, but the system needs to be reworked to bake in transparency (all transactions made public knowledge BEFORE implementation not just on request as per FOI bill) and accountability (all transactions have a well-defined set of people who would be held liable in case of shenanigans)
