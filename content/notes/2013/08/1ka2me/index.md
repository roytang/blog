#### Posted on r/3DS: [SMT4/Etrian Odyssey Streetpass?](https://reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/1ka2me/smt4etrian_odyssey_streetpass/)

Hi,

A coworker has Etrian Odyssey IV streetpass activated on his 3ds, while I have SMT4 streetpass activated on mine. But I'm not getting any streetpasses from him (other than Mii Plaza of course)

I've downloaded from the eShop the "Shin Megami Tensei IV Update" released on 07/16, is this the one that enables streetpass with Etrian Odyssey IV? Or there's something else I have to download or install or set?

Thanks!
