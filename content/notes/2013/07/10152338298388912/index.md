So, the way I'd handle the traffic thing (in addition to the promised fixed salary for bus drivers and removal of colorums) is to try to reduce yung number of cars on the roads in conjunction with improving public transportation. I'd add taxes on cars used in Metro Manila (as in may sticker for cars that have paid the tax; no sticker = no driving in Metro Manila, and stickers have to be renewed every X years, and cars that are too old won't get renewed) the funds earned can be used to pay for better public transpo. I'd add an additional train line along C5 parallel to MRT3 and probably another one on the other side of EDSA somewhere - public transpo needs to get to the point where everyone, even car owners would be more comfortable taking public transpo. Sorry to car-owning friends, but if we keep adding more vehicles, we're going to end up like that Indian city with parking problems everywhere.
