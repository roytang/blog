#### Posted on r/ipad: [Is it safe to delete purchased apps from my iTunes library (to save disk space on my PC) and just redownload them later if needed?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/1hv40r/is_it_safe_to_delete_purchased_apps_from_my/)

<time>[22:06]</time> How about copying the itunes backups to a different drive or an external HD or something, is that possible? I'm not short on space, the problem is that the itunes library is stored on my OS folder and that's getting pretty low
