#### Posted on r/television: [What TV series had the best pilot episode ever?](https://reddit.com/r/television/comments/1n3psp/what_tv_series_had_the_best_pilot_episode_ever/)

I'm wondering if there are any shows that blow the viewer away right from the pilot episode, instead of needing a few episodes for the style of the show to sink in.

A pilot episode that when you watch it you're like "I must watch the rest of this show"
