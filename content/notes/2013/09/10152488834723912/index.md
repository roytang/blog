Jinggoy's privilege speech is actually great!

1. It's like he's basically given up on denying misdeeds and just wants to take down as many people as he can with him.

2. Even if all the things he says are true, all of this stuff coming out can only be good for transparency and for catching those who have done us wrong and for preventing similar future shenanigans

Now we just have to avoid falling into the trap of being confused by #1 (which was the obvious intent) and still prosecute the hell out of him and his cohorts
