I guess I&#x27;d bump out the Michael Keaton Batman because it&#x27;s in my list for campy with moments of serious.    I can&#x27;t remember, did the Indian guy have any abilities other than motivational speech and (I think) costume design?    Also, hmm. I guess if Batman counts as a superhero, V from V for Vendetta should also count. So, hmm. Hmm. I&#x27;d bump out Batman Begins to put in V for Vendetta, because they&#x27;re both super-serious treatments.    So, my amended list: V for Vendetta, Superman 2, Avengers, Mystery Men, Iron Man.",
