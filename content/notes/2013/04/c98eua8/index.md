#6 is part of the Omega Effect crossover with the Daredevil and Punisher books

#8 is an epilogue for the Ends of the Earth storyline from Amazing Spider-man

They are probably not included in Vol 2 because they are included with separate volumes for their own storylines. 

It should be fine to miss them, but you might also be interested in reading the above two storylines.

[00:26] Also, Avenging Spider-Man is mostly 1-offs or 2-part stories, so it's not really that critical to hit all the issues.
