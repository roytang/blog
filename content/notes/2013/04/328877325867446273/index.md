#IronMan3 It was ok. Not as great as some people have said, but probably better than 2. [@alvinjtang](https://twitter.com/alvinjtang/) says it'll look worse in a few years.

Some people I know (big comic fans) were disappointed at the Mandarin build-up then the let-down reveal. I dunno, I was kinda fine with the deception.

I felt like the second half of the movie was way too predictable.

Did Tony Stark just utter a bunch of gibberish to get Happy Endings Max to climb to the top of the van and tweak a screw on a satellite dish?

Apparently it's all right for Pepper to wear the armors (one of them at least, and a hand or two), but Tony can't spare one for Rhodes because "they're all coded for me"

How did two Mark 42 parts make it out of the garage while the rest had to bang against the door to get a kid's attention?

I watched this movie more than a week ago, so those are all I could remember right now. I thought it was okay, but not "best in the trilogy okay".
