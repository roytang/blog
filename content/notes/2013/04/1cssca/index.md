#### Posted on r/PS3: [Injustice - different region games can't play against each other?](https://reddit.com/r/PS3/comments/1cssca/injustice_different_region_games_cant_play/)

So my friend has an R2 copy of Injustice while mine is R3, and apparently we can't play against each other online? When we get the invite from the other person it asks us to quit the current Injustice game and insert the "Injustice Gods Among Us" disc, even though that's what we currently have.

Is there any workaround for this? It's quite sucky =/
