This is a figurine of one of my favorite anime characters Roy Mustang, I'm a bit fond of it. But because I'm a terrible person with a bad memory, I don't remember who gave it to me (I seem to recall it was an exchange gift type of deal). Will the terrific person who gave it to me please raise their hand so I can say thanks again?
