I'm one of the laziest people around, but even people like me can do something for the typhoon victims. You can donate to the Philippine Red Cross to assist in relief operations. Donations can be done online or via SMS, so there's literally no reason not to help, even if you might have to miss a Starbucks or two this week. http://www.redcross.org.ph/donatenow 

CNN has compiled a list of other ways to help, even for those outside the country: https://us.cnn.com/2013/11/09/world/iyw-how-to-help-typhoon-haiyan/index.html
