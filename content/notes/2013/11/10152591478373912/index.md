  If you have helped someone or donated money it is unbecoming to declare the amount or % of your income. Just donate and ask friends to do the same. This is not about you.

  If you do not believe in God, it is unbecoming to mock the prayers of those who do. Isn't it logical that if you don't believe in prayer, a better use of your time would be to volunteer? This is not about you.

  If you do not believe in government or relief agencies or the military, it is unbecoming to mock the documented service of others. If you think everyone has an agenda, shouldn't you demonstrate yours by working to make sure relief is deployed properly? This is not about you.
