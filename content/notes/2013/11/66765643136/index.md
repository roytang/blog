<blockquote><p><strong>EDIT: On the original image, I mistyped Haiyan as Haiya. That has been corrected, and everyone who’s already purchased the image set should be able to just go and re-download it.</strong></p>
<p>As many of you know, the Philippines were absolutely ravaged this past weekend by Super Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan). The death toll is expected to surpass 10,000. Beyond that, millions are without food, water, shelter. A state of calamity has been issued. Things are grim.<br/><br/>What many of you may NOT know, is that the Philippines is the second-largest readership of JL8, only surpassed by the US. Not that I wouldn’t step in for a tragedy of this magnitude regardless, but as such, it hits a little bit closer to home than most.<br/><br/>All that being said, I’m offering a wallpaper/cover photo bundle pack at my webstore for purchase. All proceeds will be donated to UNICEF Philippines, whose goal is to primarily assist the children affected by this disaster.<br/><br/>Obviously, the timeline photo has been posted up right here, and you can use it if you want without donating anything, and that’s fine. If you do, though, I ask that you include the information for donating when you do post it, so that others may find a way to give.<br/><br/>The wallpaper and cover photo can be found <strong><a href="https://gumroad.com/l/YNXB" title="Gumroad">here</a>.</strong><br/><br/>Also, the original art will be on auction <strong><a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=271319365441" title="eBay">here.</a></strong><br/><br/>Thanks guys.<br/><br/>-Yale</p></blockquote>
