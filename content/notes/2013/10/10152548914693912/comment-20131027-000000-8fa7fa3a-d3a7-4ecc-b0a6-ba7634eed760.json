I&#x27;m sure they have a say on local transport such as the tricycle routes, and are part of the discussion when greater commute routes intersect their part of town - jeeps, fxes are the most common. They also handle the flow of traffic (which admittedly only involves the blocking of roads) during barangay-wide festivals.",
