#### Posted on r/ipad: [Noobish question about transferring epubs to ibooks via itunes](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/15ts8s/noobish_question_about_transferring_epubs_to/)

How is this done in the new itunes? In the old one I just drag epubs to the iPad on the left side panel. In the new itunes I tried going to the Books tab of the iPad but it seems I can't drag anything into there.

I don't wanna do syncing or anything, I want to be able to copy/remove books individually as needed.
