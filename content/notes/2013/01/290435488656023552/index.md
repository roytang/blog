Apparently i am an hour too early to check in to my flight (@ Terminal 2 w/ 15 others) http://4sq.com/VDuZ3Y

<time>[20:34]</time> Michael Daniel V. Samson Christine 'Tin' Rabe Paul Villangca thanks for letting me crash at your place and for the fun weekend (despite our terrible performance lol) :D

<time>[21:06]</time> So tired from walking around all day carrying a heavy bag.

<time>[21:36]</time> Despite the number of times I've flown, there's still a childlike sense of wonder when I feel the plane lose contact eith the ground. That such an unimaginably heavy machine could be hurtling us through the air at incredile speeds and heights is still a vast accomplishment of science and engineering. And then when the plane hits the ground again and you bounce around a bit and everything is rattling, you wonder whether it's really a miracle that the entire thing held together during the flight.

<time>[21:52]</time> There's a lounge near my boarding gate. Baka makatulog ako dito and miss my flight
