  "text": "I went there mostly because I was bored during weekends in college. I found some pretty good sci-fi there, if you're patient enough to dig through those Danielle Steele, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, etc books. I found a few novels by William Gibson (Mona Lisa Overdrive, Virtual Light) both cost around 70 pesos each. I found my very first Dune novel there (the first book, and last time I remember seeing the Emperor God of Dune there also, but did not buy it). Edward Abbey books (a collection of his writings and The Monkey Wrench Gang). Singer's 'Animal Liberation,' several short story collections, books on psychology.\n\n\nThose are just several of my good finds there. There's a lot more good books if you're patient enough and you know what you want to find, but mostly I remember a lot of sci-fi.",
