Despite the number of times I've flown, there's still a childlike sense of wonder when I feel the plane lose contact eith the ground. That such an unimaginably heavy machine could be hurtling us through the air at incredile speeds and heights is still a vast accomplishment of science and engineering.  And then when the plane hits the ground again and you bounce around a bit and everything is rattling, you wonder whether it's really a miracle that the entire thing held together during the flight.
