#### Posted on r/civ: [Offline strategy guide/tips for Civ5 G&K?](https://reddit.com/r/civ/comments/16d9ay/offline_strategy_guidetips_for_civ5_gk/)

Hi,

I'm gonna be travelling for a bit, and I'm looking for a PDF or something else (maybe a single web page that I can save) that I can read offline while I'm travelling. I'm looking for the sort of thing that I can read off the civfanatics forums, but I dont want to have to save each thread individually? Just thought I'd post here on the off chance that someone one knows something like this somewhere.

Thanks!
