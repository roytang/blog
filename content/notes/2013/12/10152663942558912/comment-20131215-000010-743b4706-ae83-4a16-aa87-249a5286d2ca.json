Based on your experience, do you think the problems are largely political/ legal (i.e. due to contract provisions or because of prior unpaid obligations, etc) rather than technical (i.e. due to network inefficiency or poor maintenance of power plants, etc) or economic (lack of supply)? I ask because I had a discussion with someone from the EEE faculty, they mentioned that the current structure of the Luzon grid is quite inefficient and for areas like Visayas and Mindanao there is barely enough capacity to support the demand.",
