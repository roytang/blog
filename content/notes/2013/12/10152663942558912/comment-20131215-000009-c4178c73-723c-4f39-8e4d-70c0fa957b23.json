  "text": "I used to work as environment consultant back in PH from 2001-2006. A lot of new entrant foreign companies ask us to act as third party consultant to perform Due Diligence, mostly for identifying potential regulatory and reputational risk before deciding on purchasing power generation assets in the Philippines. Essentially, management of those power generation assets open up their records and sort of also allow us to freely interview their operational staff including sometimes, selected members of their management. Sometimes they share to us candid information about their contract with the government - and some are quite shocking. In one power generation facility, during their first year of operation, they were actually generating power full capacity for almost year without even being connected to the national grid. Transco at the time was delayed in building the transmission line - and the cost for that unused power is passed to consumers. In another one, this time a hydro power, they are paid in full even if they have not delivered sufficient electricity during summer season. Others, especially those government owned ones - the extra cost shouldered/ passed  to consumers mostly relates to Stranded Contract Cost and Stranded Liability. Essentially, these are unpaid obligations by Napocor and as part of the new contract (i.e., to make it palatable with the new operator) - they have agreed to include this in the universal cost paid by consumers. Generation cost on a facility basis is actually almost at par with our ASEAN neighbors, but retail cost passed to consumers are onerously high to cover those simple &quot;contractual issues&quot;.",
