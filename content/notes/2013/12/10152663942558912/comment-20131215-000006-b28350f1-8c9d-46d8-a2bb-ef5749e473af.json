Note that this distribution cost is spread evenly to the consumers. Also, people who consume less than 100kW have roughly half the rate that everyone else pays for. Again, subsidized by the consumers. And then there&#x27;s EPIRA of course. Corruption. And overall inefficiency of our old facilities. It would be nice to have a study that directly answers your question though.",
