I've often read that our country has the second-highest cost of electricity in Asia (or are we the highest already?) Has there been any study or analysis conducted and published that provides a breakdown of why we have such high costs?  Is it solely due to Ramos-era expensive IPP contracts? If so, how long until we can get out of these contracts? Can we renegotiate them somehow, or at least the provisions that are disadvantageous to the government/public?  Or are we overpaying for some other components such as labor, fuel, components, maintenance, distribution, etc costs? Are our power plants more expensive? Can we compare cost breakdowns with our neighbors to find out?  I would think that if you were a newly-elected President appointing a secretary to the Department of Energy the first two things you would ask for would be (a) an analysis like the questions above need; and (b) a list of proposals to drive down energy costs. But I don't recall Erap, Gloria or PNoy coming out with any such analysis or plans. (Aside from the WESM which doesn't appear to have been successful in driving down prices)  Anyone on my feed have more knowledge on this topic, anyone involved in the national power generation and distribution systems (wala ba mga EE diyan lol)?
