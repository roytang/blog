If proven to be true that liabilities (and assets corresponding to these liabilities), are passed to consumers, we can sue IPP&#x27;s and Transco for economic sabotage.  I mean, we as consumers.  I am so curious on the gross profit margins of Transco.  If way above international comps, we are truly fucked.  Not to mention generating power 100% capacity utilization without connecting to the grid.",
