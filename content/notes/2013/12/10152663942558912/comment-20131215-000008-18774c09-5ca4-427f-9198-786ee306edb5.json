Since there is a lack of legitimate competition in a capital intensive sector such as this, they will JACK UP prices and SUCK us dry.  Why?  Because they can. Kulang na kulang ang competition dahil illegal for foreign capital to compete with domestic monopolies. What we thought was a good economics policy in 1987, it was just actually a legal change of the same crony system in the 70&#x27;s.  Pinalitan lang ng apelyido/ pamilya.  Same monopolistic concept.  Just different names.",
