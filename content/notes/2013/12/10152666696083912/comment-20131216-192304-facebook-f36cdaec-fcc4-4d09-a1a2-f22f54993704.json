  "text": "I think the transpo companies raised a big brouhaha over fixed wages earlier this year, I'm not sure what happened to the proposal. As a commuter, I wouldn't mind if bus fares became more expensive (I'm not against the MRT fare hike either) if it meant safer driving and less overloading. But of course, the majority of the riding public will whine about it",
