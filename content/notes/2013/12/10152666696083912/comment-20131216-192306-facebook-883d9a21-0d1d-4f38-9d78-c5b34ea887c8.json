  "text": "If you mean a mechanical solution that would physically prevent a vehicle from speeding, I think it's technically possible, but not economically viable. It would require modding thousands of vehicles, and a mechanical failure is much riskier than a digital one.     Also, I think placing a physical limit on vehicles is from a mentality that treats Filipinos like kids who can't learn discipline, the same mentality the MMDA uses when installing physical barriers like ugly pink fences between lanes, and fences to prevent people from jaywalking. They achieve their goals, at the cost of not educating the public.    I think rather than physical barriers, negative incentives (that are actually enforced) would be better. And here is where penalizing bus operators has an advantage: unlike catching motorists who cross lanes illegally or catching jaywalkers, bus operators are tracked, licensed, and have more to lose. And it takes much less manpower to implement a fine than to watch the streets. (requires speedometer tech though)",
