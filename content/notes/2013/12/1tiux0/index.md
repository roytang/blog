#### Posted on r/CrusaderKings: [Noob question - I'm the King of England and vikings keep coming and raiding my shores, how can I prevent this?](https://reddit.com/r/CrusaderKings/comments/1tiux0/noob_question_im_the_king_of_england_and_vikings/)

Also, will my vassals not do anything to defend themselves? I keep having to raise troops myself 

Edit: also sometimes i'll chase away some viking troops and they vanish and reappear a few territories over. Am I unable to see them while they are moving?
