[Michael Daniel V. Samson](https://www.facebook.com/682247123) [Joel Caisido](https://www.facebook.com/1417660202) remember this? :p For some reason I had a copy of the programme from the year after we won. (Pisay apparently did not send a team for the '95 event). I remember the last question was some area computation where we knew the formula from a booklet Mike had that we coincidentally read just before the final round.
