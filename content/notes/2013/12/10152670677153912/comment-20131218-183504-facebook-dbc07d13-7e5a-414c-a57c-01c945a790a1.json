  "text": "I'm not saying additional trains will solve everything, but getting more trains is a lot easier than revamping the stations. But what would really help would be additional train lines that provide an alternative to the MRT - probably one near/along C-5 that makes access to BGC and/or Paranaque easier, and probably one more on the other side of EDSA somewhere. And of course better/more reliable buses... sarap mangarap lol",
