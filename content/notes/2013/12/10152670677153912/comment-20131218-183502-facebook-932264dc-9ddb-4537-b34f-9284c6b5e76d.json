  "text": "I don't get why they need to increase the station capacity if they're limiting the number of people allowed in the station? It seems they really just need additional trains.    Getting into North Avenue station was already pretty bad without this crowd control scheme, so it's only going to get worse. On the other hand, it should be slightly easier to get on a train on some of the less populated stations (i.e. Kamuning), so I guess it spreads the wealth around a bit or something.",
