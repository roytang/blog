  "text": "Roy Tang  I think we would be fooling ourselves if we say that \"if only there were more trains there would be no problem\" -- the MRT is severely under capacity in terms of number of trains, station size, and especially the number of carousels.     Merely increasing the number of trains without increasing the number of exit carousels would mean a lot of people are lined up stuck at the exit and probably crowding out people who may want to get a ride. This is where a station size increase will make more sense. Also you can't really add to the number of entry/exit carousels without a larger station.     In my post above however my only point is because the stations are small the lines tend to extend *outside* of the station, causing problems even with vehicular traffic when people spill over to EDSA.",
