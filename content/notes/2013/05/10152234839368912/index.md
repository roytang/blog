Based on social media and discussions among people in the voting precinct, it feels like this time around a lot more people went out to vote and made wise and responsible choices. I hope new voters don't get too discouraged by the results; we've had idiots in the senate before, we can survive them (her?) again. We can't change the outcome anymore, but we should stay vigilant during the counting and figure out what we need to do to make things better next time around. Our responsibility doesn't end with one vote. Cheers :D
