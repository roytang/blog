#### Posted on r/vita: [My Vita uses a US account; Can I buy an R3 SFxT and use the extra characters DLC on my R3 SFxT PS3 copy?](https://reddit.com/r/vita/comments/1e678r/my_vita_uses_a_us_account_can_i_buy_an_r3_sfxt/)

I'm not sure whether the SFxT character DLC comes as a code with the game (in which case there wouldnt be any problem), or if I somehow need to login the Vita with my R3 account.

Edit: To be clear:

PSN account on my Vita - US

SFxT PS3 copy - R3 (Asia) (I already have this)

SFxT Vita copy - R3 (Asia) (I plan to buy this)

I already know the DLC from the Vita copy will work with the PS3 copy (since they're both R3); what I don't know is whether (a) the SFxT Vita copy will come with a redemption code for the character DLC that I can just redeem in the PSN Store on my PS3 (I have R3 accounts for this- HK and SG); or (b) I would need to have an R3 account on my Vita to be able to get the DLC
