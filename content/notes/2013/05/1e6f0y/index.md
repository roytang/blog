#### Posted on r/SFxT: [Question about transferring the character DLC from Vita version to PS3 version](https://www.reddit.com/r/SFxT/comments/1e6f0y/question_about_transferring_the_character_dlc/)

My Vita uses a US account; Can I buy an R3 SFxT and use the extra characters DLC on my R3 SFxT PS3 copy? I'm not sure whether the SFxT character DLC comes as a code with the game (in which case there wouldnt be any problem), or if I somehow need to login the Vita with my R3 account.

To be clear:

PSN account on my Vita - US

SFxT PS3 copy - R3 (Asia) (I already have this)

SFxT Vita copy - R3 (Asia) (I plan to buy this)

I already know the DLC from the Vita copy will work with the PS3 copy (since they're both R3); what I don't know is whether 

(a) the SFxT Vita copy will come with a redemption code for the character DLC that I can just redeem in the PSN Store on my PS3 (I have R3 accounts for this- HK and SG); or 

(b) I would need to have an R3 account on my Vita to be able to get the DLC
