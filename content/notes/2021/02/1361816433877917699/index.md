Globe fiber's been down in the house since yesterday afternoon. On the bright side, I managed to finish a book and a game yesterday. Reading and playing, not writing and making, unfortunately.

<time>[07:15]</time> It's Ash Wednesday, so I guess it's a bit of penitensya for me =/

<time>[20:28]</time> Globe internet outage in tandang sora area into its 28th hour so far. [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) hasnt replied to me DMs in 10hrs. Internet service is crucial during the pandemic, so more responsive customer service would be nice

<time>[20:30]</time> There are so many ways Globe's customer service could be improved and/or streamlined. I am already composing a blog post in my head lol
