Globe fiber's been down in the house since yesterday afternoon. On the bright side, I managed to finish a book and a game yesterday. Reading and playing, not writing and making, unfortunately.

It's Ash Wednesday, so I guess it's a bit of penitensya for me =/

Globe internet outage in tandang sora area into its 28th hour so far. [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) hasnt replied to me DMs in 10hrs. Internet service is crucial during the pandemic, so more responsive customer service would be nice

There are so many ways Globe's customer service could be improved and/or streamlined. I am already composing a blog post in my head lol
