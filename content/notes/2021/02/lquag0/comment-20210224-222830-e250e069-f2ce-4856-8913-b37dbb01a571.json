  "text": "It wasn't a one-off night of no matches found that prompted me to post, this has been the general case for me for about the past two years/seasons, I think. I'm occasionally able to fight a match, but most of the time it takes me a long time to look for one, then I just give up out of frustration.\n\nI didn't have much time last night, but I did actually manage to fight \\*one\\* guy (well, best of 3). Took me ten minutes to find that match, and after playing our 3 matches, I tried waiting another 10 minutes or so, couldn't find another so I gave up. I did lower my settings to 3-5 for this one, so maybe I'll just try that for a few days.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for the advice!",
