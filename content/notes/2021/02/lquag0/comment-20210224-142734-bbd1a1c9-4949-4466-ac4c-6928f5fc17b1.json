Maybe you just were unlucky last night and there wasn't many people on ranked at the time. Some people are just testing the balance changes on Casual mode.\n\nSomething you could do is changing your battle settings to 3-5 connection , this helps finding more people, but you should enable the \"ask for confirmation\" option, that way you can check the opponent's connection before you go into a match.\n\nOne last thing, when I'm looking for ranked and it's taking too long I also enable the Casual matchmaking, that way I have a couple casual matches between ranked.",
