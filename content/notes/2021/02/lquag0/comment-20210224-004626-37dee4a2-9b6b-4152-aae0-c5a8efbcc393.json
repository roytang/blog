  "text": "Maybe your connection settings are a bit ambitious for your area? I don't know how the internet is in your part of the world. Also, if your own connection is bad, you're gonna have a bad time insisting on 4-5 bar opponents, who are more likely to block bad connections, themselves. Try lowering it to 3-5 and see how much that helps. In my experience, you get some awful matches at 3 bars, but if you keep blacklisting the laggy, warping people, you can get it to where 80% or so of your opponents are fine, and that results in a lot more total good matches than with higher connection standards.",
