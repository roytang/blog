Unfortunately, I lent out my PS4 copy a while back and can't get it back easily now due to some kind of pandemic lol. Also, most of my unlocked last DLC from the last 2 seasons is on Steam now.

Would streaming (Netflix, Youtube, etc) interfere with the matching? I'm sure I'm the only one who'd be doing large downloads in the household, so I can certainly avoid that, but other people are almost always streaming video when I'd want to be playing.
