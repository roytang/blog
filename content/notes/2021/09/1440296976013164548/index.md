Iâ€™m a sucker for shiny new things so of course when I saw iPadOS was available I just installed it immediately. Can finally have widgets on the home screen and can remove apps from the home screen without deleting them! (Android has had these features forever lol)

[20:50] Maybe now I'll finally get around to organizing my home screen(s). Also, hopefully this upgrade improves performance!
