title: Magic Arena Decathlon 2021

It took me SIX ATTEMPTS to get my first #MagicArena Decathlon token in the MID+VOW sealed event. Not sure I want to bother with the Alchemy one

<time>[2021-12-21 13:43]</time> I tried the Alchemy event anyway and got there in one run! So much for being better at Limited than Constructed lol. I ran Monoblack blood. One more token to qualify for the finals! I guess this is the #MagicArena decathlon thread now.

<time>[2021-12-23 17:21]</time> #MagicArena decathlon event 3: VOW traditional draft, got there in two tries. I'm qualified for the finals now! Now to decide if I want to try to complete all 10 events lol.



I've already done like 5-6 runs in event 4, it's so swingy!

<time>[2021-12-24 00:25]</time> #MagicArena decathlon event 4: New Player Decks. Finally got there with GW after trying so long with BR. Swept the run too!



I guess I am attempting the rest of the events?

<time>[2021-12-26 14:42]</time> #MagicArena decathlon event 6: Historic Artisan



Got there on second attempt. First attempt was with Monoblack, second with Merfolk.



Four attempts so far with event 5 (bot draft), haven't gotten there yet.

<time>[2021-12-29 21:56] </time> Missed out on event 5 of the #MagicArena decathlon, so the perfect run is out (and I wasted far too many gems), but I did manage to get the 6th token via event 7 (Historic), guaranteeing 2nd run at the finals! Took me three tries with BG Food. Yet to decide whether to go for 8

<time>[2021-12-30 08:49] </time> #MagicArena decathlon event 8: singleton. Got there in 2 tries, using Sam Black's list. Each game took forever though! At least I didn't spend gems. One more token to get a third finals entry!
