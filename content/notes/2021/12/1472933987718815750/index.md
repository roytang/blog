It took me SIX ATTEMPTS to get my first #MagicArena Decathlon token in the MID+VOW sealed event. Not sure I want to bother with the Alchemy one 

{{< photos 1472933987718815750 >}}

<time>[2021-12-21 13:43]</time> I tried the Alchemy event anyway and got there in one run! So much for being better at Limited than Constructed lol. I ran Monoblack blood. One more token to qualify for the finals! I guess this is the #MagicArena decathlon thread now.

<time>[2021-12-23 17:21]</time> #MagicArena decathlon event 3: VOW traditional draft, got there in two tries. I'm qualified for the finals now! Now to decide if I want to try to complete all 10 events lol.



I've already done like 5-6 runs in event 4, it's so swingy!

<time>[2021-12-24 00:25]</time> #MagicArena decathlon event 4: New Player Decks. Finally got there with GW after trying so long with BR. Swept the run too!



I guess I am attempting the rest of the events?

<time>[2021-12-26 14:42]</time> #MagicArena decathlon event 6: Historic Artisan



Got there on second attempt. First attempt was with Monoblack, second with Merfolk.



Four attempts so far with event 5 (bot draft), haven't gotten there yet.

<time>[2021-12-29 21:56] </time> Missed out on event 5 of the #MagicArena decathlon, so the perfect run is out (and I wasted far too many gems), but I did manage to get the 6th token via event 7 (Historic), guaranteeing 2nd run at the finals! Took me three tries with BG Food. Yet to decide whether to go for 8

<time>[2021-12-30 08:49] </time> #MagicArena decathlon event 8: singleton. Got there in 2 tries, using Sam Black's list. Each game took forever though! At least I didn't spend gems. One more token to get a third finals entry!

<time>[2022-01-01 09:28] </time> #MagicArena decathlon event 9: standard bo3. Took me FOUR tries. Monogreen bombed. Two tries with Izzet almost got there but every mirror match was a miserable grind. Finally swept the event with Monowhite. That gets me 3 runs at the final! (No need to do event 10!)

<time>[2022-01-09 23:47] </time> The #MagicArena decathlon finals today, with the format being Arena Cube BO3 draft. Unfortunately, I did poorly in all 3 entries! I only had two wins across all 3 entries! I also have recordings, not sure if I should bother uploading! Here are the decks I drafted:

<time>[2022-01-09 23:49] </time> The annoying thing is I actually had some practice runs in the Cube BO3 event, and all my practice runs went 3-0 or 2-1, so I thought I had a handle on the format, clearly I was wrong! Here are some of the decks I drafted that did well (you will notice a pattern lol)
