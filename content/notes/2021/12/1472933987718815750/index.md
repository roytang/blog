It took me SIX ATTEMPTS to get my first #MagicArena Decathlon token in the MID+VOW sealed event. Not sure I want to bother with the Alchemy one

[2021-12-21 13:43] I tried the Alchemy event anyway and got there in one run! So much for being better at Limited than Constructed lol. I ran Monoblack blood. One more token to qualify for the finals! I guess this is the #MagicArena decathlon thread now.

[2021-12-23 17:21] #MagicArena decathlon event 3: VOW traditional draft, got there in two tries. I'm qualified for the finals now! Now to decide if I want to try to complete all 10 events lol.



I've already done like 5-6 runs in event 4, it's so swingy!

[2021-12-24 00:25] #MagicArena decathlon event 4: New Player Decks. Finally got there with GW after trying so long with BR. Swept the run too!



I guess I am attempting the rest of the events?
