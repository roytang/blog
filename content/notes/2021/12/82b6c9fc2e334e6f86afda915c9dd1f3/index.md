Watched The Green Knight (2021). Wasn't sure what to expect. Description suggested it would be some kind of action movie. It was most certainly not. The movie is captivating, unsettling, ambiguous, and even kind of trippy. <!--sep-->Some great shots and visuals. Also it is surprisingly a Christmas movie. And there is a short post-credits scene!
