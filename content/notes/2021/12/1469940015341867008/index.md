I like Colmenares ([@TeamNeri2022](https://twitter.com/TeamNeri2022/)) as a candidate and will probably vote for him, but:



a) `When asked if a candidate's channel will need at least 100,000 subscribers to get verified, the spokesman answered, "No." ` - https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/12/11/21/comelec-to-verify-youtube-accounts-of-halalan2022-bets
