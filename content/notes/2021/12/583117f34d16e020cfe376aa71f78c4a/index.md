title: Booster Got!
---

So a friend got his booster shot around lunch time and said there weren't a lot of people and it only took 20 mins. So I checked and saw I could still book a slot for 3PM at SM North and I was like why not, if it's only 20 minutes? <!--sep-->FAM I WAS THERE FOR 3.5 HOURS THERE WERE SO MANY PEOPLE. I forgot that today was the last day of the National Vaccination drive or whatever it's called. Rewarded myself afterwards with some Pepper Lunch, first time back at a mall since March 2020!
