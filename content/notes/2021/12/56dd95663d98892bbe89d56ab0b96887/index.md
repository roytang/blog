title: 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage Spoiler-Free Review'
---

- Straightforward superhero film, not particularly exceptional or clever or funny or anything, it's just there. 
- Surprisingly short runtime, around 1:40. Plot proceeds briskly with very little cruft.

- They leaned into the "odd couple" trope which isn't a thing in the comics. 
- Pleasantly surprised that Shriek is played by Naomie Harris (Moneypenny!). 
- There is a post-credits scene.
