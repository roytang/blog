Finished the current Doctor Who: Flux series yesterday. It was a bit meh and loosely plotted, but I kinda enjoyed it. Chibnall definitely won't be missed though.
<!--sep-->
The season seemed to mostly revolved around trying to dig out of the Timeless Child background set up in the previous season while at the same time squeezing out a last chance to use classic Who villains: Sontarans, Daleks, Weeping Angels etc.

Also: So many companions! Anyway, apparently Jodie is getting a few more specials next year with Chibnall before they turn the reins back to RTD. I wish Jodie had gotten a chance with another (probably better) showrunner, but alas.
