It always feels weird for me when the PH president exercises a line item veto, since presumably Congress has balanced the bill as a whole. This is an unusual power, Wikipedia only lists 3-4 countries that allow line item vetoes https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line-item_veto

Note that the PH isn't one of those listed in the Wikipedia article! I think I'll attempt to edit Wikipedia today.
