#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Android/iOS versions not available in Southeast Asia?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/mdf9dp/androidios_versions_not_available_in_southeast/)

Has anyone in SEA been able to get the mobile versions? I'm from the Philippines, me and my friend in Singapore both can't find the app on the stores. Even when using a direct link, the stores will just say Arena isn't available in the country/region. Any others from SEA countries have any luck?

Have they released any official word on this? Or is there any WOTC staff here who can shed some light on why it's not available in SEA?

So annoyed that the MTG twitter accounts have the audacity to claim Arena is now available "everywhere" on mobile when it's definitely not.
