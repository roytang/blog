Got my #mtgarenastats email for Midnight Hunt! I missed 3 weeks of play so I didn't even complete the mastery, but 94 boosters opened is pretty good considering I had 120+ opened for KHM and STX

[16:26] (and I didn't get a stats email for AFR for some reason...)



Also, this stats email didn't give me the "most drafted commons / uncommons" stat, is it because I didn't draft as much this time?
