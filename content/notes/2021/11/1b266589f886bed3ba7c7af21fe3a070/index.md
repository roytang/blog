Watched Dune (2021). Only read the book in 2014, but I can hardly remember the plot except for the broad strokes. Movie is pretty good though; a reasonable adaptation of a supposedly "unfilmable" book. Arrakis is pretty close to how I imagined it in my head. <!--sep-->The sandworms look great. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Timothee Chalamet gave pretty good performances. Ending might be weird if you didn't know it was a two-parter going in. Looking forward to the next movie.

<time>[23:23]</time> Also a bit tempted to look for a copy of the 1984 Dune film lol. Maybe after the second part of this one comes out.
