Watched Blade Runner 2049 (2017), mostly because I had recently watched Dune (2021) and wanted to see more Denis Villeneuve. Was not disappointed. Fantastic visual design and cinematography. <!--sep--> Lots of familiar actors showed up! Harrison Ford only appeared halfway through. I liked the reveal of how what the movie was telegraphing all along was a fake.
