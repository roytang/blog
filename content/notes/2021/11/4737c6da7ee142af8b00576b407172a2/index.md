Watched Blade Runner 2049 (2017), mostly because I had recently watched Dune (2021) and wanted to see more Denis Villeneuve. Was not disappointed. Fantastic visual design and cinematography. <!--sep--> Lots of familiar actors showed up! Harrison Ford only appeared halfway through. I liked the reveal of how what the movie was telegraphing all along was a fake.

[2021-11-11 09:31] I actually don't remember when I watched the original (probably only within the past 10y or so; I never saw it during the time it came out) and don't recall most of the plot, but I feel like this one was much easier to follow. Maybe because I had subtitles!
