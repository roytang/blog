#Loki spoiler-free review:



- overall plot was fine, if not predictable, given what we knew about mcu phase 4 going in

- weak pacing and writing in most episodes; could have easily been a two hour movie instead of six one hour episodes

- good watch for mcu fans because of the larger phase 4 implications, but much weaker as a standalone series
