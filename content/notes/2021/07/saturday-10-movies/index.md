A couple of movies we watched during our Saturday gaming session yesterday:

- **America the Motion Picture (2021)**. Alternate history retelling of American revoluion, complete and utter nonsense. Good fun and we had a few laughs, but I really hope no American takes it seriously.
- **Ice Road (2021)**. Random Liam Neeson action flick that we actual started last Saturday. Somehow they managed to make a two hour movie about driving a truck across the ice. I thought it would be better than it was because it had Laurence Fishburn, but I guess that's not really a good basis. One of those films where I wouldn't have minded sitting through it on cable, if I was busy doing something else.
