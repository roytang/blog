title: Under Siege (1992)
---

Saturday gaming group decided to do a movie watch-along while we played and randomly settled on Under Siege (1992) for some reason. I'd never seen it before and several times I said "Isn't this just Die Hard on a boat?" and apparently that was a universal consensus. Very 90s. <!--sep-->Unsurprisingly this is already Seagal's best-rated movie and has a surprising number of familiar and even good actors, including Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, and Colm Meaney (Star Trek's O'Brien)
