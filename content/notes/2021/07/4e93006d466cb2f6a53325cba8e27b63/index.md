License to Kill (1989): Bond film no 16, Dalton's second and last outing is much darker and yet weaker than the first one. The first one where Bond goes rogue, driven by vengeance instead of duty. Unremarkable theme song. Villain is a drug smuggler; <!--sep-->I guess with the collapse of the USSR they couldn't have another Russia-centered plot. More actors look familiar as we near the 90s. Notable are a young Benicio del Toro playing a henchman and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (known for playing Shang Tsung. <!--sep-->Dalton's performance is mixed, and for some reason he reminds me of Sir Patrick Stewart in some scenes. Too bad he couldn't have had a better sendoff as Bond.
