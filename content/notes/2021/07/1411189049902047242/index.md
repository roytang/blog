I played almost all of FF8 junctioning only 1 of a spell to each stat, not considering that increasing the number might lead to better stats. Got all the way to the final boss this way, which felt impossible with my low stats #gaming

I played through about 20 hours of Skyrim before I was aware of fast travel in the game. 



I also got to the end of disc 1 in FF7 before realizing I could equip weapons and materia. 



Has anyone else made these kinds of mistakes?
