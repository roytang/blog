  "text": "Hi,\n\nplease try to reset your SMC first:\n\nTo reset the SMC on a Mac notebook, first determine whether the battery is removable. Most older Mac notebooks have removable batteries. Mac notebooks that have nonremovable batteries include MacBook Pro (Early 2009 and later), all models of MacBook Air, MacBook (Late 2009), and MacBook (Retina, 12-inch, Early 2015 and later).\n\nChoose Apple menu > Shut Down and wait for your Mac to shut down.\nPress Shift-Control-Option on the left side of the built-in keyboard, then press the power button at the same time. Hold these keys and the power button for 10 seconds. If you have a MacBook Pro with Touch ID, the Touch ID button is also the power button.\nRelease all keys.\nPress the power button again to turn on your Mac.\n\nPlease report back if this helped you.\n\nKind regards",
