title: Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan season 2

I binged season 2 of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan this week (after watching season 1 back in 2018!). This season felt tighter than the first in terms of pacing and such.<!--sep-->But I'm not happy with the way it promotes American interventionism and their easy willingness to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign nation (however justified it may be)
