title: What Matters Now by Seth Godin
---

I finished reading What Matters Now by Seth Godin, a book that is basically a collection of short blog posts by "big thinkers", released for free back in 2009. Interestingly, a lot of the ideas presented in the book still feel relevant today. I didn't think it needed a full review post. 

The funniest part for me is that one of the entries is by Jason Fried about how to apologize, advice he certainly could have used during [the recent Bandcamp brouhaha](/2021/05/weeknotes-2021-05-09/)
