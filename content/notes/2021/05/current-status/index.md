### How am I spending my time

- I'm working on multiple personal projects, most of which I don't want to talk about. The only public one is this website/blog. I write as often as I can and am constantly trying to update this site to make it better or more to my liking.
- I still do a lot of gaming
- Quiz team does online [quiz nights](/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/), a few times a month
- Check the [weeknotes](/tags/weeknotes) for regular updates.

### Recent highlights

- I got my [second dose of Sinovac](/2021/05/1391294087064477699/)! But I'm still hunkering down.
