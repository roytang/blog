This mindset reflects someone who doesn't respect institutions or the  law or civilized agreements, and basically respects only one thing:  power. That's why he thinks people who oppose China want war and why he  doesn't want to offend China, power is all he sees and values, like the thug that he is.  For this kind of person, you can't be right because of the law or  because of principle, or because of justice, you can only be right if you had the ability to  enforce that right. Basically the type of leader who would just  collaborate with any invaders who managed to overpower us and would say wag na lang tayo gumawa ng gulo, andyan na e.
