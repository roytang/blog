title: Strixhaven limited summary
---

Just based on my public drafts, my Strixhaven limited win/loss record is at 54%

I actually started checking this because [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/ni948c/in_less_than_24_hours_strixhaven_draft_challenge/) claimed that if your win% is at least 56% then the upcoming draft challenge should be profitable, so I just miss that threshold lol. Area for improvement!
