Bond film no. 10: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). The best Moore installment so far. Excellent opening sequence. Austria; Cairo, Egypt; Sardinia, Italy. 007 and Triple-X have great chemistry. <!--sep-->Jaws has to be the most unstoppable Bond villain / henchman. Stromberg's Atlantis reminds me of the Legion of Doom's base in the old Superfriends cartoon. Actually, I think his evil plan might be the best one so far as well.<!--sep-->I wonder if I can get through the rest of these before No Time to Die actually comes out lol.
