\>  Hold the power button for 10 seconds and plug in the mag safe connector  while you keep holding down the power button for another 10 seconds at  least. 

Was I supposed to do this while the laptop was off? because of course it started turning on in the middle of the first 10 seconds.

I also tried it while the laptop was on, in which case it shutdown during the first 10 seconds.

Either way, it does not seem to have changed anything.

\>  Have you thought about switching out the battery? 

As you mentioned, macbook airs dont have removable batteries. Also, wouldn't the fact that I am sometimes able to charge it, depending on how I place the magsafe connector, imply the problem is with the connector or port and not the battery itself?
