THE SUICIDE SQUAD spoiler-free review:

- great, fun, violent, hilarious, possibly best of DCEU so far
- trailers have spoiled waaaay too much of this movie
- first act was ok, second act felt a bit meh, third act was great
<!--sep-->
- hard to comment on actor performances without spoiling things, but Daniela Melchior was great and Idris Elba took the role seriously
- there is a post-credits scene
