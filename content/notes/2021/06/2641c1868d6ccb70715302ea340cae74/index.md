For Your Eyes Only (1981): Bond film no. 12. After the sci-fi fantasy of Moonraker, this one is more grounded and down-to-Earth, a callback to early Connery adventures. No megamalomaniacs to defeat, just foreign agents and mercs.<!--sep--> The opening sequence pays homage to the earlier pre-Moore films, acknowledging the death of Tracy Bond and killing off a villain that looks suspiciously like arch-nemesis Blofeld. The opening song is pretty good.<!--sep--> The rest of the film was ok, if a bit forgettable. I liked the rock climbing scene, but the ski chase and car chases felt like things we've seen before. Also, Moore is starting to show his age.

Melina Havelock (portrayed by Carole Bouquet) reminded me a lot of DCâ€™s Huntress - a crossbow-wielding woman out for revenge
