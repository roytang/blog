#### Posted on r/Philippines: [I'm looking for an old Pugad Baboy strip](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/nvukbz/im_looking_for_an_old_pugad_baboy_strip/)

Baka merong may copy. In the strip, Patrolman Durugas has stopped Mang Dagul for a traffic violation, tapos pinilisopo sya ni Dagul, so binigyan sya ng ticket, nakasulat "violation: pilosopo"

I would guess it's from the early books, kasi I remember medyo raw pa yung art style. Probably somewhere in books 1-3, kasi I have book 4 here, parang mas polished na yung art.

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!
