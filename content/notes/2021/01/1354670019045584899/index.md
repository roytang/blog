The whole Gamestop brouhaha reminds me of the explanation I made for stock market prices a while back on reddit's ELI5 forum: https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/6c9plk/eli5_stock_prices_constantly_changing/dhtc9qo/?context=3

"There is no magic formula that predicts what stock prices will be (whoever discovers that first will be rich). It's largely a matter of perception and psychology. Sometimes stock prices move mainly because of rumors or speculation." -&gt; basically everything's made up, lol

And if I may add, if this reddit thing ends up as a catalyst to topple/reform capitalism, unlikely as it may seem, I would find that hilarious
