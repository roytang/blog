#### Posted on r/MagicArena: [Foretell and Revealed Cards in Hand on Arena](https://reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/kw2qun/foretell_and_revealed_cards_in_hand_on_arena/)

I'm wondering how Arena will handle using Foretell when some of the cards in the opponent's hand are revealed to you, since the card you exile with foretell should be hidden information. i.e., if I thoughtseize you and you're holding 3 different foretell cards, then during your turn you pay 2 and exile one of them, the other 2 should no longer be revealed to me, since I would be able to deduce which card was exiled.

Have they made any statement about this? I'm not super confident they'd handle it well lol.
