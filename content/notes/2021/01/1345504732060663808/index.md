PSA: if you keep your timeline in "latest tweets" mode (click sparkly blue icon on top right of app) you will have a chronological timeline and never have to see what your follows like. I always forget that's a thing since I never see it

I feel like folks don’t fully realize that liking a tweet puts it into their followers’ feeds (almost at the same rate that RTs do).



When I see a tweet because “X liked this”, I am now re-evaluating whether I should follow them because of their “like curations”
