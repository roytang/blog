Fun use of the counters to get around memory issues in paper.

If it only has the flying counter -> it's a 4/4 Spirit Warrior Angel

If it has the flying counter and the 2 +1/+1s -> It has the Ophidian ability

(If the +1/+1s get removed, you start to get confused.)

There is no counter to help with the 2/3 mode.
