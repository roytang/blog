I see some people posting like "why are you all excited about biden, the US is still going to be imperialist/not progressive enough/whatever" and i'm like ugh sure whatever, lots of room for improvement still, but did you actually prefer trump?

The US just kicked out a racist, misogynistic, egocentric sociopath president, let them enjoy that for a little bit maybe? There's no shortage of people willing to push their admin for reforms either.
