This was probably the worst of the wrap-ups from the past year.
<!--sep-->

- arrived late
- page didn't even work for me at first, had to try again after a week or so
- design is terrible, lot of wasted space
- includes global stats, when this is **My** Wrapup! Have a separate page for that!

<!--sep-->
I was however amused that my second most played game was the Tales of Arise demo, which I didn't even play for more than an hour lol
