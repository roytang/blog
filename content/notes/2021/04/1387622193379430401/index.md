[@joshagarrado](https://twitter.com/joshagarrado/) [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) Hi Josh! It's you! Lol sorry, for some reason Twitter never gave me a notif for this.



Apparently the bundle is part of the normal package I got when I signed up for my plan, except the first 24mo were free. So when the 24mo were up, they automatically charge me for it.
