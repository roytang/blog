Saturday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven

Managed to do 2 drafts today. First one with Witherbloom only went 3 wins, but I managed 4 wins with the second one using Quandrix before a matchmaking bug ended my draft prematurely (hopefully we get reimbursed!)
