Thursday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven

Went Silverquill, only finished 4-3, mostly due to a really bad misplay on my part in the last game. Decent outcome, but could have been better. I did manage to rare-draft a lot though lol
