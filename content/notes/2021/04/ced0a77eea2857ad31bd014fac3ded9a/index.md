Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973). 

Moore feels a lot more "generic white guy" than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There's a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. <!--sep-->All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There's a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.
