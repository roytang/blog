Throwing away gems on Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven

Internet was weird today so stream was on and off. Probably won't have the full episode on YT (maybe just the last few matches). But spoiler alert: I was able to break my unlucky streak with some Quandrix + Prismari goodness!

I might also get reimbursed lol. Last couple of matches on YT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuXcPVm0YQ
