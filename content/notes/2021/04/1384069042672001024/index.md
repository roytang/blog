Monday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #mtgstrixhaven

Only one draft this session, but I had a lot of fun! Mostly because it was my first 7-win of the season, but also because I drafted an insane quandrix deck with the other 3 colors splashed, and won 3 games off Approach of the Second Sun. I never got to activate codie though!
