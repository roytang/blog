Invincible season 1 finale was pretty great, the fight was intense and afterwards I couldn't believe there was still half an episode to go. It's been a while since I read the books so I'm not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it's fine. The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!
