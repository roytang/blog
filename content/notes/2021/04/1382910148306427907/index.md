Friday afternoon Strixhaven sealed! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #MTGStrixhaven #twitch

Ended up with a 3 hour stream doing 1 sealed and 1 draft. Didn't finish too well, only went 4-3 in sealed with silverquill and 3-1 in draft with lorehold, but it's a decent enough start. I like the set so far and looking forward to trying out the other houses!
