[@joyarmadamba](https://twitter.com/joyarmadamba/) (1) his data is global (I participated), although it is reasonable to assume majority of respondents are americans/europeans. (2) "constant radio airplay" -&gt; not sure if true, I've certainly never heard "Stay" on the radio in the last 10 years.

[@joyarmadamba](https://twitter.com/joyarmadamba/) This may just be an observation bias on your part since you likely prefer listening to radio stations that specialize in "oldies" (and those radio stations exist in other countries too)
