Thread of #mtg JumpStart results: Attempt 1: Milling Elves, 2-0. 

{{< photos 1283901490206109698 >}}

[07:47] Attempt 2: Heavily Armored Enchanted (terrible choices - no way to get things off the board, Thriving lands are bad when monocolored, annoyed whenever I draw Gird for Battle), 2-4 

{{< photos 1283911181674016768 >}}

[08:31] Attempt 3: Feathered Friends + Basri. These white decks aren't good for my daily quests. Even less removal. 2-5. I think that's enough for today. 

{{< photos 1283922305400238080 >}}

[18:18] Attempt 4: Plus One Dragons. 2-0. The sad thing about this format is that you tend to spend more time with the suckier decks and not enough time with the fun ones. (I know, I know, that's actually up to me, but I want to sample as many pairs as possible!) 

{{< photos 1284070052686225408 >}}

[19:30] Attempt 5: Archeology Under The Sea. Why did I go monocolor again? 2-6. Deck was fun, but way too slow (check out that "curve"). Aaaaand I'm out of gold, so that's enough JumpStart for a while. 

{{< photos 1284088031851409410 >}}

[2020-07-20 07:07] Attempt 6: Dinosaurs Reanimated. 2-1. Power level reasonably high, with removal coming mostly from the green side (surprisingly!). 

{{< photos 1284988375355678720 >}}

[2020-07-22 19:11] Attempt 7: Vampires Devilish. Quick 2-1. Kinda boring, but eh. Way too many fours. 

{{< photos 1285895313333485569 >}}

[2020-07-22 20:06] Attempt 8: Liliana Tree Hugging. 3-3. Played a bit extra to complete my quest. 

{{< photos 1285909154700255233 >}}

[2020-07-22 20:32] Attempt 9: Milling Wizards. 2-0. My first repeat! As usual, Milling is super strong.

[2020-07-29 23:29] Attempt 10: Chandra Angels. 2-2. Losses were due to clunky hands (drawings fives and sixes while being stuck at 3-4 lands) 

{{< photos 1288496814853824512 >}}

[2020-07-29 23:48] Attempt 11: Witchcraft Goblins. 2-1. The wins were due to the opponent timing out or randomly quitting early, so that sucks. Out of gold again so I'll just keep this one around for daily quests for a while.

[2020-08-02 23:43] Attempts 12-14! Rogues Cats 2-1, Seismic Predatory 2-3, Phyrexian Plus One 2-3

[2020-08-12 23:18] Attempts 15-17! Rogues Above the Clouds 2-3, Smashing Legion 2-4 (forgot to get a deck list screenshot for this one), Dinosaur Dogs 2-0. YT of the games: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dG6-lNKfyis 

{{< photos 1293567429637861378 >}}

[2020-08-16 03:30] Attempts 18-19! Seismic Doctor (DAMNIT 5th Lavamancer!) 2-2, Basri Walls 2-1. Still missing Garruk and Teferi =/ 

{{< photos 1294718131147927552 >}}

[2020-08-17 05:28] JumpStart Attempt 20, the final one for this set (a nice round number): Reanimated Teferi. Got one of the two missing PW packets, although this combination wasn't too great, only went 2-4. Still missing the Garruk one, hopefully we get it if/when JS returns in the future

[2020-08-17 05:29] Overall, JumpStart was a reasonably fun casual experience, and I fully expect them to bring it back every so often as I think it's very good for the casual new player experience, especially for anyone wanting to build casual historic brews
