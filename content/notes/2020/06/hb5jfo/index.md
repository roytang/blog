#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [What is Miles' "new history" after they got merged into the 616?](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/hb5jfo/what_is_miles_new_history_after_they_got_merged/)

Do Miles, Ganke, Miles' family etc remember the Ultimate universe? Or Ultimate Peter Parker dying? Or were their histories "re-written" and merged into the main universe?

I'm not up-to-date with the Miles comics, but I don't remember this being explained after Secret Wars
