I’ve been alive for 40+ years, I dont think I’ve believed anything in the past that would get me “cancelled” today. (not that I’m worth “cancelling”), so maybe “everyone” is a bit strong

Since everyone in the past believed things that would get you cancelled today, the factor that determines whether they'll actually be cancelled is whether or not they happened to publish such beliefs. Which is almost random, but not quite; those who wrote little are safer.
