Quick WITCHER S1 #spoiler-free-review:

- great season, but what a tease
- I like Henry Cavill in this role more than as Superman
- although he plays the titular Witcher, the season's plot largely involves Ciri and Yennefer's origins as well

- I wish I had watched this before playing the Witcher games, it's the great backstory recap I never had
- looking forward to S2!
