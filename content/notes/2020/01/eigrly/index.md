#### Posted on r/humblebundles: [Is there any way to sort/filter the Humble Store by price?](https://reddit.com/r/humblebundles/comments/eigrly/is_there_any_way_to_sortfilter_the_humble_store/)

I have a $5 coupon that's expiring on the 3rd (from the BS region lock on Soul Calibur VI in the previous monthly) that I want to use, but I don't want to spend more than that (I'd rather not buy anything on the Humble Store if possible - Steam always gives me better regional pricing). The sort/filter options on the store make it tedious to find all games $5 or below
