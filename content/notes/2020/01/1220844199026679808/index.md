Wow, Duelyst is shutting down: https://duelyst.com/news/farewell-duelyst. I played a few hundred hours of this (Review: https://roytang.net/2017/02/review-duelyst/). Pretty good game, but there's a big learning curve and each game can take some time. Hope it can come back in some form in the future.
