  description: There's a bunch of things that don't make sense (even accounting for
    myths etc), but it helps to think this movie takes place pre-crisis.

Finally watched #WonderWoman1984. Maybe don't think too much about what's going on in the movie. My headcanon is that the only reason it takes place in 1984 is because it's pre-crisis
