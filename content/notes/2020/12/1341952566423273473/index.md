Man said, ‘The Universe is dying.’

The Galaxies were going dark. The giant stars were gone, long ago. Now there were only dying stars. New stars had been born, but they were dying, too. The old stars might hit each other and break into a new star. But for every thousand destroyed, only one would be made.

Man said, ‘If we look after it carefully, with the help of Cosmic AC, the energy in the Universe will last for billions of years.

‘But it will still come to an end. Once the energy is gone, it cannot come back. Entropy keeps going.’

Man said, ‘Can entropy be stopped? Let us ask the Cosmic AC.’

The Cosmic AC was all around them. It was no longer in space. All of it was in hyperspace.

‘Cosmic AC,’ said Man, ‘how can we stop entropy?’

The Cosmic AC said: THERE IS A NEW JAVA UPDATE AVAILABLE.
