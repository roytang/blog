I ordered this HyperX Cloud II Gaming Headset off Lazada on the first day of MECQ. It's a bit expensive. Delivery came in Saturday morning, so around a week, not too bad.

I'm actually not super-picky when it comes to audio issues, but lately the 3.5mm audio jack on my Razer keyboard has been giving off static. I couldn't move my speaker connectors to the back of the desktop tower case because I often switch them out for earphones (when I'm doing voice chat or [streaming on Twitch](/tags/twitch/) for example), and it's inconvenient to do so when they're so far in the back, so I've been wanting to buy a headset that can be plugged into a USB slot instead. That way, I can switch output sources via Windows 10's built-in software controls. (You can switch output devices by clicking the speaker icon on the Windows 10 taskbar and clicking the ^ icon near the output device name). 

I decided I might as well get a fancy headset, this will be the most expensive one I've ever bought. On the upside, I get a better (in theory) mic for recordings and voice chats (I was previously using the mic off a cheap webcam), and I can use it on the PS4 as well.

Tried it out a bit, it's pretty nifty. But sometimes the mic attachment seems to fall off too easily. Maybe I'll make a proper review once I've used it for while, although IDK if I'm not enough of an audiophile for any review to be meaningful.
