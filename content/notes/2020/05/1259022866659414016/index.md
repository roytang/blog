#mtgiko quick draft: while this Extinction Event was on the stack, I can see my opponent's cursor mouse over each of his creatures in turn, realizing 2 out of 3 were even, then over mine one at a time, realizing they were all odd. Lol. #mtg

That was my 2nd quick draft. I haven't been streaming them because I don't plan to do a lot, but this one went surprisingly well, so documentation:

And yes, that was a P1P1 rare-drafted Eerie Ultimatum lol. I think it won me like 6/7 games
