Hello [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) , can you tell me what is this "UNLI BB BUNDLE found in our latest globe at home bill

Someone asked me about this so update: The UNLI BB Bundle allows us to call mobiles on other networks from our Globe landline without additional charges. It came standard with the plan for 1yr, so after 1yr, it became an additional charge.

We were able to have it removed from our plan, which I guess is worth it if you don't expect to call non-globe numbers too often.
