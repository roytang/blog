Someone commented to me last night asking why my RSS feed includes my twitter content now. Two reactions:

- happy to get confirmation that someone is actually still using my RSS feeds lol
- because this site now archives content from across my social media behavior, the main site feed now includes *everything* including those twitter content (as notes), photos, links, etc. 

If you're interested only in blog posts or other particular content, there are specific feeds:

- Everything: https://roytang.net/index.xml
- Blog posts only: https://roytang.net/blog/index.xml
- Notes only: https://roytang.net/notes/index.xml
- Photos only: https://roytang.net/photos/index.xml
- Links only: https://roytang.net/links/index.xml

I'll link to this note from elsewhere on the site. Hope that helps!
