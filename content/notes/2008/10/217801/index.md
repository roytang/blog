title: Getting Language for Non-Unicode Programs
---

Anyone have any idea how to get the value of "Language for Non-Unicode Programs" in Control Panel Regional Settings programmatically using c#?

Already tried CultureInfo, RegionInfo and getting the default encoding using the Encoding object, but I can only get the Standards and Formats value or the main code page.
