HEADLINES:

Let’s go back in time, 40 years ago, to 1978. 8 years before the EDSA Revolution, 6 years into Martial Law, 5 years under a new 1973 Constitution ratified by the controversial “citizen assemblies”, a President ruling by decree, a decimated opposition, media that was controlled by the government & preparations for national elections for REGIONAL representation. Did we move forward, sidewards, do a U-Turn or are we running around in circles? *Newspaper headlines from Bulletin Today (predecessor of the Manila Bulletin), published by Brig. General Hans Menzi, former Marcos aide.

1. GOVT FORMS SUPER PARTY. The KILUSANG BAGONG LIPUNAN (KBL) or The New Society Movement  is created to participate in the first Interim Parliamentary Elections. Party members come from the old Nacionalista Party of Marcos, his technocrats, crony businessmen and a few turncoats from the LP. 
2. PROMINENT JAILED OPPOSITION LEADER SEEKS TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS. Convicted by a military tribunal for murder, illegal possession of firearms & sedition, former Senator Benigno Aquino Jr. decides to run for the 1978 Interim National Assembly. (He also smuggles letters & articles from his prison cell and is in solitary confinement.)
3. OPPOSITION FORMS METRO MANILA TICKET FOR ELECTIONS. The opposition fields a coalition ticket for Metro Manila under the “Lakas ng Bayan” (Laban) banner. Heading the ticket is detained leader Benigno S. Aquino with former Senator Lorenzo Tañada as campaign manager. The line-up includes Nene Pimentel (the original & better one), Former Senators Francisco Rodrigo, Ernesto Maceda, Ramon Mitra, former constitutional convention delegate Napoleon Rama, Neptali Gonzales, former Education Secretary Alejandro Roces, labor leader Alex Boncayao (for whom the dreaded NPA “Sparrow” liquidation unit was named after), former detainee and urban poor leader Trining Herrera, former activist Gery Barican and Charito Planas. (They all eventually lose of course 0-21 with Imelda topping the polls. But fabulous that it's the pimped-up ruling party today!) 
4. PRESIDENT WARNS OF OPPOSITION PLOT TO OVERTHROW THE GOV’T. President Marcos accuses the opposition Lakas ng Bayan of inciting the people to overthrow the New Society. Imelda Marcos further warned: “Any victory for the opposition will be exploited by their foreign supporters to agitate our people…It would be a pity if we give any vote to the opposition, which has allowed itself to be used by foreigners to divide the Filipino people and sow hatred and dissension in their midst.”  (No they didn’t blame Loida Nicolas-Lewis but the opposition in exile led by former Senators Raul Manglapus & Sonny Alvarez.)
5. GOVT PROTESTS HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT. The U.S. State Department releases a report criticising the Philippine government for “severe intrusions on individual rights.” The Philippine Embassy defended: “It is incorrect to state that there has been ‘severe curtailment of human rights of individual citizens.”(Damn Human Rights!)
6. GOV’T DENOUNCES FOREIGN PRESS: Foreign Secretary Carlos Romulo accuses some members of the foreign media of being biased for the political opposition. (Hmmm…fake news in 1978?)
7. PRESIDENTIAL CRONY INTERVENES IN CONTROVERSIAL BUSINESS DEAL. Businessman Herminio Disini, a golfing buddy of Ferdinand Marcos, was involved in the bid to construct what would have been the country’s first Nuclear Power Plant. The contract was awarded to Westinghouse courtesy of a 4 page proposal brokered by Disini. The Philippine National Power Corporation, the lead agency for the development of the Nuclear Power Plant, already recommended General Electric based on a 3 VOLUME proposal submitted to them. The President promised to investigate the matter. (May post-it notes rin kaya si Disini sa 4-page proposal? Naimbento na ba ang Post-its in '78?)
8. RP vs CHINA : SPRATLY ISLANDS. The Spratly Islands in the news as RP occupies Panata island bringing the total to 7 islands occupied by the Philippine military. (Still in the news again but now RP ❤ China.)
9. MAYON VOLCANO ERUPTS. Almost same time 40 years later, the volcano rumbles. Does it know something?
10. FL NOMINATED BY PINOY FOR NOBEL PEACE PRIZE. Engineer Virgilio Dionisio sent the nomination to the Nobel HQ in Norway citing Imelda Marcos’s meeting with Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi to negotiate peace with MNLF Leader Nur Misuari. (Too bad wala pa ang interwebs for on-line polling)

The last one probably isn’t as bizarre as the actual declaration of President Rodrigo Duterte as the “Best President in the Solar System” according to a “global poll”. Ano sa tingin n'yo ka-DDS?
