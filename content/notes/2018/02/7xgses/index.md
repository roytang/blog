#### Posted on r/selfhosted: [Looking for an open source self-hosted live support chat solution](https://reddit.com/r/selfhosted/comments/7xgses/looking_for_an_open_source_selfhosted_live/)

Hi,

We need to add a live support chat to a platform we're developing. It seems there's a lot of options out there and it's difficult to sift through them, so I thought I could ask reddit for help/recommendations.

Basically it's for users of our web application to talk to live support. Ideally something not too complicated to setup and support. We are a software dev team ourselves, but our client kind of added this request at the last minute so to save on costs we are looking for a prebuilt solution.

Don't need too many frills/features on the customer/UI side, but some nice to haves:

- control over the backend database
- user account integration (i.e. the operator knows which of our system users he is chatting with)

Any advice or recommendations would be appreciated!

Thanks
