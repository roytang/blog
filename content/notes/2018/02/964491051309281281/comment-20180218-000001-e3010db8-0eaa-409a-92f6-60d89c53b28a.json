And yet they have some of the lowest incidence rates of gun violence anywhere.    Oppose that to, let&#x27;s say here, at home.  It&#x27;s tough to get licensed here.  But nobody would dare say we have low gun violence here, where criminals don&#x27;t use licensed firearms.",

I read this article about Swiss gun control:  https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/swiss-guns/553448/    \nMain takeaways:  \n- Swiss ownership rates substantially lower than US  \n- Swiss gun-related deaths highest in Europe (but still substantially lower than US)  \n- Swiss background checks for gun owners are mandated    \nAs for us, well we both know \"regulations\" around here are treated more like suggestions than rules",
