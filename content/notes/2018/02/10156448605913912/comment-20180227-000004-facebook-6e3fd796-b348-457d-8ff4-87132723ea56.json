  "text": "Status quo changes from the top of my head be like:   - use robots to do jobs like farming or factory work.  - shift from services / tourism backed industry into a goods production one.  - encourage prefab construction for easier automation of construction work; put robots there too.  - higher corps taxes, but introduce a system to streamline robot integration to offset the stink caused by higher taxes.  - pay doctors and teachers more since a UBI may potentially cause an exodus.    And so on.",
