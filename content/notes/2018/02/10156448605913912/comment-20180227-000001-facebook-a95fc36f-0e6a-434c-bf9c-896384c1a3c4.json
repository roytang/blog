  "text": "I am a fan of UBI, but arguing from this perspective peeves me because UBI is unsustainable unless you can guarantee enough needs production to allow for it.    I sincerely doubt a lot (more than 50%) of people working would work if you didn't pay them or allow them career advancement. It's what the author describes as unfulfilling work. But granting UBI to give everyone freedom from work is unsustainable unless we have automated production for food, clean water, construction (+ raw mats prod),  tailoring, and healthcare as well as a myriad of other \"needs\" we deem necessary for life.    Implementing a UBI now would cause an economic spiral of death in countries like ours where it is unsustainable without massive status quo changes.",
