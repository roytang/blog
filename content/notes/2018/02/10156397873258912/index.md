#FLASHBACKFRIDAY: Exactly on this day 47 years ago, UP students walked out of their classes and installed barricades in support of jeepney drivers who were striking against oil price hike. Three were shot and 60 others were injured following military attacks inside the university, the Collegian reported in its February 4, 1971 issue. But the resistance prevailed, and the uprising went on for nine days. This historic event would be remembered as the Diliman Commune.

When no less than the president tells us to confine our education to our classrooms, we remind him of the things we have learned from the walkouts, the barricades, and our tireless activism with the masses. We remind him of every dictatorâ€™s fate.
