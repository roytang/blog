If there were Jews with wizard powers - ANY at all - you think they actually just sat out the Holocaust? Or the 2k years of oppression that proceeded it? Was keeping the wizarding world secret actually worth letting a genocide go by unopposed?

It would have to be a dark movie because the Nazis would also have wizards on their side and despite the young'uns efforts the holocaust still happens although they are able to secretly save a few people
