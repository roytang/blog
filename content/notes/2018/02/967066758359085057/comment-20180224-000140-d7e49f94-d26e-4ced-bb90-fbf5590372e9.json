If what you term as the &quot;progressive left&quot; seems to be repeating the same demands over and over again perhaps it is an indication that these are some issues that are never fully addressed in our society. Yesterday&#x27;s walkouts in particular seem to be focused on press freedom and human rights, things that I would hope to be universally valued regardless of left or right leanings. Hopefully we can agree that such things are worth fighting for.",
