There are actually people who question why state-sponsored students are protesting against the government. As a taxpayer and as someone whose education had been state-sponsored from high school, I would expect that educational subsidies produce well-informed good citizens.

And being a good citizen means being willing to stand up and  question the actions of those in power when the need arises.
Even if as  some say "rally lang ng rally", it is better for the country  that they  err on the side of activism than the other way around, as a  deterrent to  the power of the state. Student activism isn't a bug, it's a feature.
