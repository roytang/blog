  "text": "I faced a similar problem last year when I wanted to automate something. I tried learning python, but then I realised even if I learnt it, I would still need to learn to set it up on the PC, etc. I had limited time I can devote to this (clingy toddler), so I looked at other things. I  figured out I can use Google Sheets' version of VBA for my problem (and I had used it before so it wasn't starting from scratch for me). This way my time was spent on programming, and not on setup or learning a new environment. Bonus was not having to learn another language  \ud83d\ude42",
