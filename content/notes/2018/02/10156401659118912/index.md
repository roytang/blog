This article goes into more detail than that last one. Apparently the interviewees were asked about "murder, teenage pregnancy rates, terrorism, and vaccination among other topics." If the questions were about statistics, I think the general ignorance would be understandable. Like, I wouldn't be able to quote teen pregnancy rates off the top of my head. However, I surely won't be confident in any answers I give. Also David Ramirez I think we *are* one of the poorest among the countries who participated in the survey.

Edit: The ignorance would be more understandable, because statistics aren't usually the concern of most people. But of course it's always better if awareness were higher.
