One thing I learned about the US federal government during Trump's stint that I like is that the DoJ and the FBI have some semblance of independence from the Office of the President. Enough so that Trump himself has to deny planning to fire the Special Prosecutor investigating him (in what would be a blatant conflict of interest) 

...in the Philippines on the other hand, the President gets to pack each office with obvious lapdogs and brazenly, publicly suspends an official that's investigating him from a supposedly independent body. (Not a lawyer, so I won't comment on the jurisprudence thing, but how is suspending someone who's investigating you not blatantly wrong?) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
