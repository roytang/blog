#### Posted on r/Philippines: [Used book stores in QC?](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/a75srs/used_book_stores_in_qc/)

Any recommendations? Baka lang may alam kayo na di ko pa alam lol

There's Book Sale sa malls of course, but the selection isn't really that good.

There's Bookay-Ukay in Teacher's Village, selection is a bit better than Book Sale, but parang hindi sya bukas the last time I was in that area.

There used to be a small used book store with a pretty good selection called Chapter IX in Circle C mall along Congressional Avenue, but it doesn't seem to be there anymore.

The best one I've found sa Metro Manila was this pop up stall that often appeared in Greenfield near Shaw on Friday evenings. Haven't been there for a few years, so IDK if this is still a thing, pero maganda yung selection nila madaming sci-fi/fantasy classics (I got my copy of Dune there)
