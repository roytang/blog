Christmas Steam giveaway! Somehow yet again I've accumulated a bunch of extra keys for Steam games, so I'll give some away this Christmas. Here are some games I'm giving out:

Darksiders II: Deathinitive Edition
Shadowrun: Dragonfall - Director's Cut
Shadowrun: Hong Kong - Extended Edition
Sniper Elite
Sniper Elite V2
Resident Evil Revelations
World of Goo
Elders Scrolls Morrowind

Edit: Adding some other keys I found, but I'm not sure these are still valid (we'll find out when someone asks for them!)
Crusader Kings II
Legend of Grimrock

If you'd like one of these, please add me on Steam (my account name is "hungryroy"), comment below with your Steam account and the game(s) you want. The Steam account is required. If you list multiple games, you'll still only receive one if you win. If multiple people want a particular game, one will be chosen randomly or at my discretion. (There is no DTI representative.). Recipients will be chosen on Saturday the 29th.

I don't ask for anything in return, but if you have any extra Steam trading cards you're not using, I wouldn't mind if you sent me some.

Merry Christmas!
