<p>Arrowverse Elseworlds crossover spoiler-free review!</p><p>- if you&rsquo;re not aware, episode 1 - Flash S05E09, episode 2 - Arrow S07E09, episode 3 - Supergirl S04E09<br/>- I don&rsquo;t usually review TV show crossovers but TBH I can&rsquo;t recall any other any TV show crossovers and I just really, really enjoyed this one<br/>- basically a love letter to DC comics fans, a celebration of dc comics/TV/movies from the past four decades, and apparently a prelude of things to come. Non-comicbook fans might not be as happy as me lol<br/>- all three episodes were great (middle episode slightly worse because Arrow lol), I was smiling all the time and apploauding all the references</p><p>
- frankly not everything made sense, but I&rsquo;ll forgive it (I mean, have you *read* crisis on infinite earths? lol</p><p>- bonus: for more zaniness, also watch this week&rsquo;s Legend&rsquo;s of Tomorrow, they didn&rsquo;t want to be outdone! <br/></p><p>- I also watched Aquaman today, and that was fine (review later) but I decided to write a review of this crossover first!<br/>- tonight&rsquo;s reading list (image attached)</p>
