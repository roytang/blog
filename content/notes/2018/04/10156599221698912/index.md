Avengers Infinity War Spoiler Free Review:

- I'm amazed that so little of this movie has been widely spoiled
- movie was fantastic. the movie somehow managed to do everything it needed to do while not doing disservice to any of the bazillion characters involved.
- the plot moves quickly. there is no good time to pee.
- there is one post-credits scene.
- very happy to have watched in imax
