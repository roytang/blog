Retweeted Alex McElroy (@abmcelroy1):  

Three easy steps to writing a novel: 

1. Think of a joke.  
2. Create a fictional character who might tell that joke.
3. Spend next 2-7 years creating a fully-realized fictional world where fictional character will have an opportunity to deliver joke once at a fictional party.
