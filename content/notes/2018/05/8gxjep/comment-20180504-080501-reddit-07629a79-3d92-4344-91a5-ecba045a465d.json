  "text": "There's a fairly significant \"what is\" and \"what it should be\" gap in here (and in many other parts of Philippine governance), but yes I think that there is utility to the Barangay as a level of administration below cities (and above HOAs).\n\nIf anything, it should be MORE important to us than even national-level positions, because things like neighborhood gentrification, public spaces, roadworks, and low-level enforcement all interact with the Barangay on some level, and those things tend to have much more effect on our daily lives than *Senatorial debates*. The decision of a Barangay to allow its inner roads to become \"friendship routes\" (or to compel interior villages to comply with such a decision) has relatively significant implications for traffic, as another example.\n\nThis is also the level of governance where individual votes can matter, and also the level of governance where grass-roots activism can have an effect. From a sociological perspective, it's worth noting that the Barangay is the closest you can get to the \"100 persons within any individual's tribe\" model (HOAs are probably even closer, but aren't a normally defined/recognized entity).",
