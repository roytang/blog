Deadpool 2 SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:

- entertaining enough; kind of a popcorn movie. i kinda liked the first movie better
- if you watched the first movie, you kinda know what to expect in terms of tone and humor and all
- dont bring your kids. but if it matters to you, there is significantly less sex in this movie than the first one
- the plot did go in ways i was not expecting
- i did not watch in imax, it seemed fine
- there is a mid credits scene. well, scenes. like five of them strung together
- there is no end credits scene but there is a... small bonus near the end if you pay attention
- would i recommend na panoorin ni mama: definitely not
