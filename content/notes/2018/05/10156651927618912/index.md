  I absolutely love this.
 </p>
 <p>
  Edit: Okay so I deleted the Facebook app on my phone last night because I was getting bogged down by not knowing what’s next for me having just graduated from college, but I had to come back when I realized the kind of traction this was getting.
 </p>
 <p>
  I got my degree in Communications and got minors in Global studies and political science because I think there’s nowhere near enough conversation happening in our world. It’s way easier to polarize groups of people, and take part in what Rene Girard called the “scapegoat mechanism” when we’re talking about “them” and not “us”.
 </p>
 <p>
  I posted this series of tweets because I really enjoyed this story and it inspired me (being the daughter of two educators and someone that considers herself a global citizen), and I thought I had lots of friends that would enjoy it too. But since it’s gotten so much attention, I feel responsible to encourage all of you to follow this user on Twitter (he’s great, and has a lot of insights that I would never consider on my own), and identify concrete ways that we can help people in this position. Social media is a wonderful tool, and “slacktivism” is often helpful, but we can’t stop there.

  Here is a list of organizations that help immigrants and refugees:

  This whole thing has renewed my faith in the power of stories, and given me hope for my future as a professional communicator, and for our worldly community.
