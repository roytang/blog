  "text": "But they are judges.  They're supposed to decide only on the merits, not the personalities involved.  They can only consider things established in court following the rules of evidence, and not their own personal feelings.  That is the fairness, presumption of innocence, and due process guarantee of court actions as promised by no less than the Constitution.    \"The business of a court is to try the case and not the man; and sometimes a very bad man has a very righteous case.\"",
