  "text": "I would like to say also, for the record, that, after their finality, I have respected every decision handed down by the courts, even the ones I feel are completely biased or downright wrong.    Because that is the rule of law.  We lawyers submit controversies to the courts.  We ask them to adjudicate.  And then we obey the decision, regardless of how we feel about it.  The rule of law is based not on the correctness of a ruling, but on the respect that is accorded to it.    This is the legal process.  Of course it's imperfect, because it is run by people, using laws enacted by people, sometimes dependent on the perception or understanding of witnesses who are people, and people are imperfect.  But at least we have a process to resolve issues so that we don't have to kill each other on the streets every time we have disagreements.",
