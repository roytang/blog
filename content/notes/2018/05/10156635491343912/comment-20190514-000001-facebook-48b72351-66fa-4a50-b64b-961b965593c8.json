  "text": "I obviously have a different experience regarding CJ Sereno than Atty. Maranan does, in how the CJ treats litigants, makes decisions, and administers the court.    In case you're wondering, based purely on the reasoning of his opinions in our cases, I also have very little faith in getting what I believe is justice from J. Leonen.  So much so that, when I make a pleading that he has to rule on, I always list him as an automatic \"no\".    I can give you specific examples but I don't want to do it here and get in another keyboard fight, or cause somebody to doubt the relevance of my profession, or have my character questioned.  So, if you ask, I will PM.    So because of that, I believe differently that Atty. Maranan.  Plus, I didn't study at UP Law, so there is no reason for me to be fanboy regardless of my personal experience.",
