I have heard of literally no one that wants us to go to war. When a person thinks that any criticism or protest should immediately translate into violence, it says a lot about how he thinks. There are other options between war and treason.

[@JMAurelioINQ](https://twitter.com/JMAurelioINQ/) [@10avendanoINQ](https://twitter.com/10avendanoINQ/) President Rodrigo Duterte: “We will declare war against China, provided that those noisy should go first. I will be there behind them. But when we get there, I will leave them behind. It’s up to them. They are the ones who want to fight.” #WestPHSea
