As to whether those who testified in the impeachment proceedings should have recused, I agree it looks bad that they didn&#x27;t.    Lawyers know this: whenever we feel a judge us biased, we file a motion for inhibition, to ask the judge to desist from hearing a case.  But unless the judge is a relative of one of the litigants, in which case the inhibition is mandatory, the question of whether the judge should desist or not is left to the discretion of the same judge.  It is called voluntary inhibition, and the judge can choose to continue or desist.    If judges recused all the time at every allegation of bias, it would allow litigants to forum-shop; to try out judges until they find a favorable one.  Pretty soon there will be no one left to adjudicate a matter.  So jurisprudence also cautions judges from recusing voluntarily, reminding them that it is their duty to render judgment.
