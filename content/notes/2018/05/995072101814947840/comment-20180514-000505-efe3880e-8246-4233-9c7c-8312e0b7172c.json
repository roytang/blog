  "text": "Weng, your stance here makes the entire practice of law worthless, as it makes the profession of law and the implementation of law in the courts entirely arbitrary and dependent purely on the personnel involved. The bar exam may as well forget about memorizing things and the application of precedent and be about who you know.    The law either applies all the time or it applies none of the time. If you only support it when it is convenient to you, it is a prop that can be set aside rather than an applicaiton of reason.    Every new act can be justified as &#x27;establishing a new precedent&#x27; or a new interpretation.  Being a lawyer becomes entirely fluid, every wrong can be defended, every right can be denied, entirely dependent on who your client is.",
