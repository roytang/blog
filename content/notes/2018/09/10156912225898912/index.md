So today the police came round and arrested several men in the area for not wearing t-shirts... Hauled them off to jail, to book them and process them, for not wearing a t-shirt. It's a real sight to behold uniformed, well armed policemen (full assault rifles), wandering and driving round the streets looking for poor people to round up and arrest on the flimsiest excuse... 

The damage the police have done in communities like Payatas is difficult to explain. Difficult to fully express. But the damage done within the culture of the police will not be repaired for decades. 

It will take decades for the country to recover from this... politically, economically, and socially...

You may not be scared that you'll be randomly targeted in order to fill out the quotas for arrest, but once they've run out of options in the poor communities, yours will be next.
