Earlier I was out walking and a tiny kitten no bigger than my foot started following me around. It would run ahead of me a little bit, darting between my legs and sometimes over my feet (almost made me trip one time), then crouch down a bit until I was past him again. This wâ€¦

This went on for a bit until we ran across a slightly larger puppy that sort of gave the kitten a death glare. I walked past, but the kitten didn't follow. I looked back a few meters later and the two were still locked in their death stare.
