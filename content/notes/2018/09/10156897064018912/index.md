Poor Bicol :(

{{% quoted url="https://www.facebook.com/jcbpbayan/posts/10160742713085103" label="JC Punongbayan's Facebook post" %}}

There's one more aspect to the whopping 6.4% inflation rate last month: It hides the fact that inflation feels differently across different regions and commodities/services.

Bicol, for instance, experienced the highest overall inflation rate at 9%, followed by ARMM 8.1% and Soccsksargen 7.9%. Again, for comparison, the national average is 6.4%.

Meanwhile, rice inflation is 7.1% nationwide, but 12.5% in Bicol, 12.4% in Soccsksargen, and 11.7% in Ilocos. Vegetables are particularly worrisome, because it experienced double-digit inflation nationwide at 19.2%. In Cagayan Valley, it even reached 35.6%!

Is this what the econ managers call "not alarming" and "quite normal"? ðŸ˜¤
