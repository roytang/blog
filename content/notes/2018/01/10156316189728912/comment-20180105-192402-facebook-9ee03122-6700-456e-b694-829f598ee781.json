  "text": "Much like testing, I would prefer if startup storytelling like this show the negative cases as well. Unfortunately, because startup failures are way more than successes, we rarely get to document or read about them.  :(    Once you have that, I bet you will find little correlation with sheer grit (assuming this was measurable) and success (assuming this was measurable as well) because (1) people can just move the goal posts; a success story isn't potentially done until the person dies or a company's exploits end in failure.    Let's look at Uber and Nokia. Uber is a success now. Nokia used to be one, but is regarded as a \"failure\" because it got disrupted by smartphone tech and the iPhone.     If in the future, some landmark legislation bans Uber that has repercussions worldwide (eg. Uber gets banned because an Uber car is used as a getaway vehicle for a robbery, or otherwise abetted a crime) or Uber itself gets disrupted, it will be marked as a failure like Nokia - success becomes a footnote instead of a defining feature.    Let's also take a closer look at the Angry Birds story. If Angry Birds creators failed with Angry Birds, just like they did with their previous 51 games, what would be a reasonable time to change it up because continuing on is stupid, and when would it be considered giving up too early? The 200th game?    Elbert Hubbard's quote might be 100% applicable to sweat equity, but the leap is quite demanding when looking at financial equity. Without angel investor funding or sheer luck, many of these companies would not have these infographics written about them.  :|",
