Black Mirror S4 spoiler-free review! (episodes listed from most enjoyed to least):

4.6. Black Museum (reminds me of White Christmas)

4.1. USS Callister (fun, but I was annoyed by how infeasible the technical premise was)

4.4. Hang the DJ (kind of telegraphed the ending)

4.3. Crocodile (felt like a police procedural)

4.5. Metalhead (would have probably appreciated it more if it wasn't a Black Mirror episode)

4.2. Arkangel (kinda boring and draggy)

Overall I liked S3 a lot more
