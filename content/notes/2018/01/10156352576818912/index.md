  "Three Iloilo town mayors on President Duterte’s list of local officials with alleged links to the illegal drug trade have joined the Partido Demokratiko Pilipino-Lakas ng Bayan (PDP-Laban) [Duterte's own political party].
 </p>
 <p>
  "Iloilo Gov. Arthur Defensor Sr. said the names of the three mayors have been removed from Duterte’s updated narco list, as confirmed by Alvarez before the oath-taking."
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems politicians are only part of Duterte's drug list when they are in the opposition.
