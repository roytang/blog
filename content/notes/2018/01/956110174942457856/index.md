I had put off watching PUNISHER (on Netflix) since i wasn't really too hyped about it. But now that I finally got around to it, I really like it.

The pacing was good throughout the season (which was one of the weakness of the recent MCU Netflix seasons such as Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Defenders) and it didn't falter halfway through and stuck the landing.
