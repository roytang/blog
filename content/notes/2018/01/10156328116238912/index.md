Fellow Filipinos.

We may be divided on many things but I think we all acknowledge that traffic is shit.

I announce to you now a great secret: give way and take turns. Especially when merging. 

If you let someone ahead of you, that person did not take anything from you. We all sit in the same traffic and your angry attempts to prevent people from getting in your lane do not make you any faster--they increase odds that you will get stuck squeezing against another vehicle with no way for either of you to get through, and then you added traffic for everybody. Or you get into a stupid accident and instead of losing 20 seconds to let a person ahead of you, you have to wait for cops to come and resolve the accident. And then you also lose time and money to fixing it. 

Or you leave it and every time you see that gouge/dent you can remember that you were being a fucking idiot.

Don't fing speed up in full stop traffic 5 feet trying to keep another car from getting ahead of you.
