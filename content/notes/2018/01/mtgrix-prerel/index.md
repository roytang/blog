I went to The Habbit to play the Rivals of Ixalan prerelease, but the event did not fire. Apparently most of the regulars had played the midnight prerelease and didn't want to do anymore. Weirdly, I still have a record in my PWP history of playing in a prerelease for this set, with a 3-1 record! Lol shrug. I did end up buying a couple of prerelease packs though. Posting pictures of the Prerel packs here for posterity.
