[@GoingAnalogShow](https://twitter.com/GoingAnalogShow/) [@FFGames](https://twitter.com/FFGames/) does randomized mean (a) "you don't know which deck from a list of possible decks you're getting" or (b) "you know which deck archetype you're getting but the the actual cards may vary" or (c) "you have no idea at all what your deck may contain" or (d) something else?
