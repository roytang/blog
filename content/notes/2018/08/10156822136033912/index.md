  For linguists, Tagalog is one of the most fascinatingly complex languages, primarily because of the way verbs conjugate.  In many languages, verbs conjugate mainly by tense (past, present, future) and by voice (passive, active).  For Tagalog speakers, thatâ€™s just the tip of the iceberg, as the language has multiple triggers.

  On top of this, there are no rules about which prefix to use: ma, mag, or um.  What psychotic society invented this verb system anyway?
