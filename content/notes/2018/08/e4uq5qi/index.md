Amazing, this was it! I last posted this a couple of years ago and no one was able to identify it! Thanks a bunch!

But why is the video posted in English? The Wikipedia page doesn't list an English release for the game and I definitely remember only playing it in Japanese. Or is there a romhack translation?
