#### Posted on r/tipofmyjoystick: [[Famicom][Unknown year] Side scrolling RPG-ish metroidvania](https://www.reddit.com/r/tipofmyjoystick/comments/9adwh8/famicomunknown_year_side_scrolling_rpgish/)

**Platform(s):**
Famicom (probably no NES version)

**Genre:**
RPG/Platformer/Metroidvania

**Estimated year of release:**
Famicom era, so sometime 1986-1990 maybe

**Graphics/art style:**
Side-scrolling 2d graphics. The environment was all in, uh, I want to say "blocks" (like a mario game I guess?), with the main character being like 1.5-2 blocks high.

**Notable characters:**
The main (and only) character was I think some kind of bluish knight kind of person with a sword. 

**Notable gameplay mechanics:**

**Other details:**
A friend and I played it back in the Famicom days, we had to study katakana/hiragana to figure out how to advance. It was some sort of primitive metroidvania-style 2d platformer with exploratory elements. This is all I have to go on unfortunately. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
