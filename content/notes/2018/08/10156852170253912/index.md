Wow. Hard to add anything to this commentary. When the enforcers of the law decide to abuse their authority, not even being a lawyer would protect you. These days perhaps the only real protection is clinging to those in power in this administration.

  “This is the first instance I have ever heard that the POLICE have started GOING AFTER the LAWYERS directly, using 'obstruction of justice' as their trump card. As of this writing, the police have not shown any report or evidence of what amounts to “obstruction of justice” from the NOTE-TAKING and BANAL PHOTOGRAPHY that those three young lawyers did,”

  Akala ba ng mga tao e porke kaya nila kumuha ng abogado, safe sila sa mga kagaguhan ng mga pulis?

  Sinabihan ng mga pulis yung kilala kong lawyer na nasa listahan na siya ng mga abogadong tumanggap ng drugs cases. Ni hindi kasalanan nung lawyer kasi naassign lang sa kanya yung pro-bono case nung drug defendant.

 <p>
  Read up on Martial Law.  Things are bound to get worse. We warned people about these pero talagang ipinaglaban ng mga DDS ang polisiyang pagpatay ng Poon nila. Eto na po yung effect nun: police impunity.
 </p>
 <p>
  Kapag takot na mga lawyer ipagtanggol kayo, puwede na kayo taniman ng mga pulis ng kahit ano. Puwede na kayo gawan ng kahit anong kaso at wala kayong magagawa.
