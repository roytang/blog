Thread of historical OS bugs 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/Foone/status/1058676834940776450" label="Foone's tweet" %}}

It is 2018 and this error message is a mistake from 1974.

This limitation, which is still found in the very latest Windows 10, dates back to BEFORE STAR WARS. This bug is as old as Watergate.
