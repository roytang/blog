#### Posted on r/EternalCardGame: [Please indulge me: After one year and 400+ F2P hours, I finally hit Draft Master, the last Steam achievement I was missing. This was my 3rd month that I tried going for this. I started out with 80k gold and ended up with around 40k](https://reddit.com/r/EternalCardGame/comments/9yqj5i/please_indulge_me_after_one_year_and_400_f2p/)

<span class="source">(Twitter)</span> After 1 year and 400+ hours of F2P with [@EternalCardGame](https://twitter.com/EternalCardGame/), I finally managed to hit draft master, the final achievement I needed to complete the Steam achievements (there's a lot more in-game though)

<time>[17:09]</time> I had previously tried going for this with 30k and 50k gold, both times weren't enough. Got lucky this time. Made it to master in 21 drafts.
