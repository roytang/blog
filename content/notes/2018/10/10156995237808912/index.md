A while back I decided to try posting to the blog (https://roytang.net) more often. FB now prevents me from automatically cross-posting the posts into my timeline, so if for some reason you'd like to read more of my writings, feel free to follow the blog via an RSS reader (those are still around, I use https://feedly.com) or if you prefer staying inside Facebook's walled garden, I also created a page https://www.facebook.com/roytangpage (automatic crossposting to pages is still supported). I don't write about any specific topic per se, but if you knew me in person, you have an idea of what I like to talk about. I claim to write mostly for myself (it helps me think), but I would appreciate commentary and feedback as well!
