This is why I find ridiculous the idea of airbnbing out a room in the same house where you live. I wouldnt do it unless I stayed at home all day to watch my stuff.

So, I Airbnb out a room in my apartment. I had a guest checking in;  Everything was normalâ€” I come home to this man cleaning up my apartment. He picked the lock on my bedroom, threw away every photo I had of male friends, and went thru my closet..
