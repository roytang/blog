  "text": "Ours is probably the last or close to the last generation that will remember \"normalcy.\" The grandkids of our generation will have to deal with desertification  and flooding on scales we only imagine in apocalyptic fiction. Their coldest days will be hotter than our hottest days. Our worst storms will be their average bad weather.    And while carbon sequestration tech may improve and get cheaper, I just don't think there will be the will to impose it on the global scale required. By the time that starts happening, it will be a matter of keeping the Earth from turning into Venus, instead of keeping us \"normal.\"",
