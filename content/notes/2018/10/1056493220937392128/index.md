[@mlq3](https://twitter.com/mlq3/) [@noelledeg](https://twitter.com/noelledeg/) Hm, would it be better to have an index page that lists the post titles ordered chronologically? Something like the attached, so that visitors can scroll easily to find specific time periods 

[@mlq3](https://twitter.com/mlq3/) Might want to reduce archive lists to either title only or title+excerpt. For example if I click the tag douglas macarthur the resulting page https://philippinediaryproject.com/tag/douglas-macarthur/ will show all the content of all the posts with that tag, making it difficult to scroll through
