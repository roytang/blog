Huh, surprisingly despite Yahoo Messenger being dead, you can still download your messenger data until Nov 2018 https://ph.yahoo.com/?p=us

<time>[2018-10-08 23:52] </time> sheesh. I got the notif that my download was ready and I clicked the link but it said "Your download request has been completed, but no data of this type is available in your account." I'm sure I used that service [@Yahoo](https://twitter.com/Yahoo/)!
