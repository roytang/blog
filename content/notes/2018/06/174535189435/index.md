<p>
Playing Skyrim: I have my wife (Aela) and adopted child move into my 
homey cabin in the woods. I ask Aela how the kids are doing and she asks
 what I was thinking bringing us out into the wilds where there are 
wolves and bears and whatnot. Ignoring her, I talk to the child and 
offer a game of tag. The child immediately runs outside and I chase 
after her to find her being attacked by wolves. I hurriedly draw my 
sword, Aela would never let me live this down
