#### Posted on r/Philippines: [r/PH: What do your bookshelves look like?](https://reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/83ncai/rph_what_do_your_bookshelves_look_like/)

I'm told that [Filipinos are still reading books](http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/288486/good-news-filipinos-still-reading-books/?utm_term=Autofeed&utm_campaign=Echobox&utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#link_time=1520720516). When I visit other people's houses I like looking at their bookshelves. What do yours look like?
