Today's grammar pet peeve: "cope up"

This morning on TV, a reporter was interviewing a Thai student of the PMA. The student said at first he was not fluent in English and Filipino so he had difficulty "coping up"

Me: Okay, he's not fluent, that's fine.

The reporter follows up with narrative. "But he was eventually able to cope up..."

Me: Argh, that reporter has no excuse!

For reference:
