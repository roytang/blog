#### Posted on r/tipofmytongue: [[TOMT] SNES (?) space shooter where you move around in a circle](https://reddit.com/r/tipofmytongue/comments/826qp0/tomt_snes_space_shooter_where_you_move_around_in/)

I'm trying to remember this game, basically it's a space shooter (like Gradius) except the POV is from behind the ship and you always face and fire towards the center of the screen and you can only move your ship in a circle around the center of the screen using left-right keys. Probably SNES era based on my murky recollection of what the graphics looked like
