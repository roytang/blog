The long weekend wasn’t super productive but at least I managed to finish reading this novel I’ve been halfway through for a couple of months now (it was Stephen King’s 11/22/63)

<time>[21:58]</time> Oh 11/22/63 had a recent miniseries starring James Franco! ...on Hulu lol. Lemme see if I can find a copy of that somewhere
