  "text": "Playing a weak devils advocate here:    1. US bills have changed. Latest being the &quot;big head&quot; ones that can no longer be called greenbacks because they have touches of other colors now.    2. We do need to change bills and coins every so often (although probably not as drastic as this) because of security feature leapfrog against counterfeiters and because of wear and tear on the currency.    3. I thought they used nickel coated steel on all the coins? So its cheaper because we are the top Ni producer worldwide (almost twice as much output as Russia) before Sec. Gina Lopez shut down several mines.    That said, they could still have put in more thought into making distinctions between coins more obvious so that mixups wouldn&#x27;t be such a problem to expect.",
