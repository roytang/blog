Hi! This demo is great! I'm new to procreate so I'm still learning the features. 

I wonder if you could give me some advice. One thing I learned here is that there is a feature like when you draw in a circle then hold the pen in place for a bit, it will automatically "smooth" the circle. However, when I tried doing this, I can't get it to work consistently. The main problem is that I have unsteady hands, so when I hold the pen in place to do the smoothing, there is often still some slight movement so I guess this is why I can't trigger it consistently. Would you know if there is any workaround or alternative for someone like me?
