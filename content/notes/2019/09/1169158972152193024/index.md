Not a fan of the templating "When &lt;trigger condition&gt;, do X, then do Y. Do Z." The full stop after Y makes it like Z is a separate thing, since it's no longer in the same sentence as the trigger condition. (Yes I know it doesn't work that way.) https://twitter.com/wizards_magic/status/1169142807564640257
