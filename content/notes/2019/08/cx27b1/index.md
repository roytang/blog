#### Posted on r/coins: [How to clean grimy and rusty coins?](https://reddit.com/r/coins/comments/cx27b1/how_to_clean_grimy_and_rusty_coins/)

I had a bunch of old coins from different countries and they were stored in a rusty metal container that was also exposed to water at some point. I checked it recently and many of the coins inside are covered in rust and grime and some of them are even stuck toģether. Any recommendations for cleaning them?
