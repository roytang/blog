#### Posted on r/MagicArena: [Settings aside the issues with wildcard pricing, what curated cards would you like to see enter the Historic format?](https://reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/cxguf6/settings_aside_the_issues_with_wildcard_pricing/)

Of course the suggestions from Wotc twitter (Bob, Bolt and Wurmcoil) are a bit ridiculous. I imagine that a lower power level would be needed. Historic needs to differentiate itself from Standard but not be as ridiculous as modern, and build up slowly but surely. I would like to see cards that had their time in Standard but haven't really found a good place in Modern. I don't agree with those saying it should be Origins-forward though, I think that's unnecessarily restrictive.

Some of my initial ideas (the first 10 are color balanced, but the rest are not):

Knight of the White Orchid

Keiga, the Tide Star

Korlash, Heir to Blackblade

Pia and Kiran Nalaar

Wren's Run Packmaster

Ojutai's Command

Shadowmage Infiltrator

Demigod of Revenge

Huntmaster of the Fells

Dauntless Escort

Siege Rhino

Cruel Ultimatum

Desolation Angel

Mystical Teachings

Char

Kessig Wolf Run
