I went 5-2 running Bant Golos. My wins were vs Monoblack aggro, Monoblack vampires, two Golgari decks (one conceded after I Treachery'd his 6/6 Questing Beast), and I forget what the other one was (definitely not monored or the mirror)

Losses were to mono-black aggro (I had the realm-cloaked giant for the wrath, but failed to notice I didnt have two white and played the wrong guildgate the turn before) and to the mirror (I got 2 field of the dead first, but he had kenrick and agent of treachery + teferi to take my fields =/)
