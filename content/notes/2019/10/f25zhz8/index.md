Oh, that wasn't what I meant. I was on the iPad app when I made the last comment, for some reason the first character of some lines is missing there. See [https://imgur.com/gallery/XVpJ0Ge](https://imgur.com/gallery/XVpJ0Ge) for what I mean. Is fine on the reddit web page itself though so  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
