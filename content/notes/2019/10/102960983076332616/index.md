<p><span class="h-card"><a href="https://mastodon.social/@Gargron" class="u-url mention">@<span>Gargron</span></a></span> ActivityPub question: does Mastodon ever refresh the content of the actor profile from the remote server after the initial retrieve? I&#39;m testing integrating with a separate ActivityPub implementation and when I changed the inbox url, it was still sending things to the old url. When I tried it from a different instance, that had never seen my server before, it got the correct inbox url</p>
