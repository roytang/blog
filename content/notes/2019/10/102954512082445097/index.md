<p>Started digging into what it would take to make my personal site connect to Mastodon by implementing ActivityPub. @roy@roytang.net is now discoverable via the Mastodon search bar, but (a) the instance seems to be caching the details, updates won&#39;t show? (b) I have my outbox list out some recent posts, but they&#39;re not appearing as toots when I search my profile on Mastodon?</p><p>I&#39;m not sure if I have to implement following and sending notifs to follower inboxes first or sth, everything currently static only</p>

<time id="102954515233638597">[18:07]</time> <p>I foresee a lot of digging into code samples and the ActivityPub spec if I want to get this done</p>
