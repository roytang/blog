"The price for being the best is always having to be the best" - nanny ogg, lords and ladies 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1182789819115724800" label="dhh's tweet" %}}

Remember when “working real hard” had a goal? Like getting out of a shitty situation, so you could stop wearing yourself thin. Now the prize for “working real hard” and making it big is that you get to “work real hard” forever.  Hustle culture sucks.
