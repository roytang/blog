Current desktop images (Windows 10 PC and Macbook Air). I've been toying with the idea of dual-booting my PC with Ubuntu because reasons (and also I miss having an Ubuntu desktop to toy around with), and I figured maybe I should document my current setup first before I try something that might end in disaster. Both of the pictured wallpapers are from [here](https://roytang.net/2019/05/street-fighter-background-wallpapers/). Also, yes I am generally bad at cleaning my desktops of icons.
