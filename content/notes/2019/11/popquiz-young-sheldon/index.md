We attended [PopQuiz: Are You Smarter Than Young Sheldon](https://www.facebook.com/events/727654121080603) at the Warner TV Pop Expo at the Eastwood Mall

- Round 1 - Men and Women of Science
- Round 2 - Gadgets and Gizmos
- Round 3 - Pop Culture Math
- Round 4 - Flora and Fauna
- Round 5 - Robots and Machines
- Round 6 - The Bazinga Round! 

We finished 2nd place and only the 1st place had prizes, and the prizes included Arrowverse figures so I was really annoyed lol. We could have won if we had used an ace in any of the rounds!
