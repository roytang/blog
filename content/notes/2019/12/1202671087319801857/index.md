This (mentioned below, read the thread) is a skill I wish I was better at (I was surely a lot more straightforward when I was younger!). Additionally, when I make a mistake, I try to explicitly say sth like “I was wrong” to signal that admitting to mistakes isnt a problem

A tip for negotiation/life is to realize people hate saying “I was wrong” so give them easy outs. They’d prefer to say:



I forgot

I wasn’t thinking of that scenario

I didn’t realize you meant adding x

I didn’t know there were multiple options

I didn’t know you talked to y already
