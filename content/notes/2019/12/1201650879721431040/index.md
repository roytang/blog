Belated realization: This is why Batman doesn't fit the Arrowverse, there is no opportunity for Wayne family drama

I watched an episode of Batwoman to see what it was like before Crisis, and it was mostly Kane family drama. Unsurprising because:



Arrow S1: Queen family drama

Flash S1: Allen family drama

Supergirl S1: House of El family drama



This is why Legends is the best one
