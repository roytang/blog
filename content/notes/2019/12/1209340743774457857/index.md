This is insightful because it’s also a sign of an abusive society. Case in point: in the Philippines when you dare to criticize the govt, their supporters will paint you as a bad guy for being disruptive and say “why cant you just be helpful”

I once read that you can spot an abusive system because when you point out a problem, you ARE the problem.
