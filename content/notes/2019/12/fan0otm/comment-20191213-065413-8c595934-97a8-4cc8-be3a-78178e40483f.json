That 8% tax is called withholding tax, then gave you 2 forms correct? one 2307 and a 2306. Those certificates should've been attached in your supposedly filed ITR for that year. Technically, you are still violating the tax code and are liable for penalties, however, you will not feel it yet and may never will (who knows lol depende sa bir kung hahabulin ka o hindi). But! If in the future, your client requires you to provide official receipts, you can only get that when you are a registered business :) so it can never hurt to be legal and a law-abiding citizen.",
