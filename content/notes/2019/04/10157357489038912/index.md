I'm going to try to log out of Facebook and Twitter for the rest of the month. Not because of Lent or anything, but because frankly I can't trust any of you not to spoil Game of Thrones or Avengers Endgame for me! Lol. (And frankly, we all need to be doing less social media anyway.) If you wanna know what's happening with me, I still post regularly on the blog over at https://roytang.net/ and you can still contact me via Messenger/Viber.
