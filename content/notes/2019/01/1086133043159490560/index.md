Now we need a skyrim mod that prompts “does this no longer spark joy?” when discarding items. and when you try to discard quest items change the message to “This item still sparks some joy”

Marie Kondo: “What’s this?”



Me: “Someone’s diary I stole from an inn in Markarth while looking for evidence to discredit the Foresworn separatist movement.”



MK: “Does it spark joy?”



Me: “No.”



MK: “Throw it away.”



Skyrim: QUEST ITEMS CANNOT BE REMOVED FROM INVENTORY.
