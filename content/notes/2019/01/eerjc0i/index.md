I started tracking my BO1 Arena games today. Out of 35 matches, I faced 8 RDW, won 50% (4 matches). I think the matchup overall is about 50-50, maybe 55-45 in Golgari's favor, and your win rate goes up if you get at least one life gain off Wildgrowth Walker. The 3 out of the 4 games I lost I either didn't have access to one color, or never got off 2 lands. (I might need to mulligan better or add more duals - I've been saving my rare WCs so I only have 3 shock 2 check)

I've played both decks on Arena; red has some explosive hands, but has a tendency to run out of steam. If they get the nut draw, there's not much you can do, and you'll be down to 6-8 before turn 4. 

Having wildgrowth isn't necessary to win - 2 out of my 4 wins I didn't draw one. 

The ideal opening hand has 2-3 explore creatures (ideally two 2-drops, squire is preferred over branchwalker and a jadelight) to ensure a steady flow of lands. On turn one you play an elf if you have it, even if you have to use a shock, because they'll bolt it everytime, and 2 <= 2-3. I kind of wish I had been tracking who was going first - I suspect it matters a lot, I'll do that tomorrow.

You want to play creatures on turns 2-3 and just assume they're going to die. You want them to waste their burn spells on your creatures. Play wildgrowth last, but if he's your only guy, it's okay to run him on 2 (especially if you have Find to get him back later). 

When exploring during the early turns, send to the graveyard Tyrant, Karn, big Vraska, or Vivienne, those won't be much help. Getting more creatures is better, just make sure you can play them.

You're going to stabilize at around turns 4-6, with around 6-10 life, and hopefully the red deck's hand is spent. 6 life is scary - you're basically hoping he doesn't have two bolts, but it happens. Stay scared, never attack without leaving a blocker for a hasted 2/2 mage. You're hoping he doesn't draw LUtS, Risk Factor or Frenzy (frenzy is the worst for him, light up is the best)

From turn 4, your priorities are:

- if you have wildgrowth and an explorer, judge whether he might have an instant bolt. If you're at 6 he probably doesn't, and even if he did, you're dead to it if you don't gain some life. If he's at one card in hand, I say go for it. If the wildgrowth was revealed (via an explore), the red player will hold back a bolt in anticipation so be aware of that. But in many cases it's better to just go for the lifegain anyway, better the wildgrowth eats the bolt than you
- start playing removal. Chupacabra takes out Chainwhirler/Steamkin and can block or eat a bolt. Contempt gains some life. If you have smaller Vraska on 4, use the -3 if he still has a creature - don't worry about letting her die, it's better than the bolt going to your head. 
- play more blockers

Past turn 6ish, if you're still at 8 life or more, you've probably won. Heck, even just getting to turn 6 is pretty good. From my notes, I finished 3 of my 4 wins at 6 life, 10 life and 9 life (I didnt note it for the 4th win). 

I also run... um, that 3/2 black guy, forget his name, "when a creature you control dies draw a card and gain 1 life". He's a bit of a disadvantage against red, you have to be careful with him. If I have enough creatures, I will explore him to the yard.

My 2-drop removal is Assassin's Trophy. If you want to improve your RDW matchup, you should use moment of craving instead, but Trophy is better vs control decks (can hit PWs) and white weenie (since it can counter their exile effects) and any of the riot decks.
