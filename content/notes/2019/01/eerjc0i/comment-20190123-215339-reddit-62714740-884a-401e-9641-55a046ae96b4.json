  "text": "Good to see that it's not as one-sidedly brutal as the mono-red players seem to claim. I'm curious though - since mono-red is the majority of the meta at my ranking, what deck would be best to punish that deck? I'm trying to play pre-boarded against mono-red but I think I've realized in the hours since I posted this that I was over-boarding and warping the deck too severely. I get the feeling that Vivien is still an excellent card and that Carnage Tyrant does a really good job stopping Chainwhirler beats as well. The upside on Vivien is that she can help you assemble the 'combo' of Wildgrowth Walker and explore creature more reliably, or at least draw lands for you to do something like find+wildgrowth+explore creature all in the same turn. She also kills enchantments, so I think boarding her out is the wrong call.\n\nI cut Midnight Reaper in favor of maindeck Thrashing Brontodon since 4 toughness matters a lot against them and I don't like the life-loss. It doesn't hurt my other m/u's too much. \n\nI was finding that I was one running out of steam against the red decks before they were. Now I think the matchup is a little better. ",
