<p>BUMBLEBEE Spoiler-Free review!</p><p>- attached image summarizes the plot. loljk (credit: Transformers (1985 - Marvel) #2)<br/>- I&rsquo;m a big Transformers fan, more G1 than Bayverse (I didn&rsquo;t even watch the last Michael Bay one). If you are like me, you will probably enjoy the film<br/>- if you grew up in the 80s like me, you will enjoy the film a bit more. Props to the 80s soundtrack<br/>- the plot is simple, straightforward and unambitious, unencumbered by any of Bayverse Megatron&rsquo;s super-complicated plans that he has been plotting for million of years in case he gets stranded on earth<br/>- not having a plethora of autobot and decepticon characters to develop on each side means the transformers are more distinctive and easier to identify, a big problem I had with the later bayverse films<br/>- i didnt understand some scenes where it looked like the characters were talking to some kind of human soldier but I can&rsquo;t see him?<br/>- foolish humans!<br/>- there is a &ldquo;mid-credits&rdquo; scene; I say &ldquo;mid-credits&rdquo; because they really only show the director credit before immediately going into the &ldquo;mid-credits&rdquo; scene<br/>- magugustuhan ba ni mama: no, she&rsquo;s not into giant robots. the movie is family-friendly, other than the violent explosions<br/>- after the movie, I went to the CR to pee, and I overheard two kids talking: &ldquo;Ano pangalan nung autobot na pula? Christopher?&rdquo; &ldquo;Cliffjumper!&rdquo;</p>
