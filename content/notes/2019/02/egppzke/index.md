See my edit above. It's hard to give an average. At 15 years, I'd certainly be expecting a six-digit ask at least. I did interview a dude once who was older than me, but his asking salary was below 100k (I think he was running some side business or sth so he didn't care too much). The range would also be highly dependent on skillset and the client and the position - at 15 years it's not unreasonable to be CTO of a small-medium-sized company. If you can get a remote job (working for US companies or such), a few hundred thousand a month wouldn't be unreasonable. Sorry for the non-answer
