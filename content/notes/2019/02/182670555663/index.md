<p>Itâ€™s Spider-Man week on ireadcomicbooks! During the DC/Marvel Amalgam crossover, Spider-Man got crossed over with&hellip; Superboy? I always felt like Spider-Man got a poor deal here given how popular he was, he should have at least gotten an adult to cross over with! At least he retained the hyphen!
