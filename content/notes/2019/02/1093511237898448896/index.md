  title: "Alita: Battle Angel (2019)" 
---

Watched Alita: Battle Angel earlier today. Pretty good. Fast pace, excellent visuals and fight scenes. They tried to cram a lot of the source material into a two hour movie. I felt like they ended in a weird spot, obviously expecting to be able to do a follow up

After watching I immediately passed by a friend's house to borrow these. Must be more than a decade since I last read them
