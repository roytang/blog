I'm a bit bored. Anyone have any programming or software dev questions? I'll answer them.

Edit: Thanks everyone for the questions! Although TBH I was expecting more like StackOverflow type technical questions haha. Also, for the career-related ones, please note I'm not claiming to be an expert or anything, these are just my opinions based on experience.
