<blockquote><p>there’s nothing purer or better than how much kids enjoy being picked up and then hurled at soft surfaces </p></blockquote>

<p>anyone who’s ever been around kids for ay meaningful amount of time should know exactly how much kids long to be hefted up and then just fuckin tossed! it’s so good! they’re so excited to get fucking tossed around like a sack of potatoes it’s so pure </p>

<p>Why do kids love it so much? Like I remember when I was a kid at diving practice during the summer, the best part was when one if the coaches would toss you into the deep end. And in gymnastics coaches would toss us into the foam pit. Do kids just have a evolutionary urge to die?</p>

<p>“Vestibular sense provides information about where the body is in relation to its surroundings. This is the sense that helps you understand balance, and it connects with all the other senses.</p>
<p>When the vestibular system does not develop properly all other senses will struggle to function properly. Without a strong vestibular sense, kids will have no choice but to fidget, get frustrated, experience more falls and aggression, get too close to people when talking, and struggle with focusing and listening. Because they literally cannot help it.”</p>
<p>“Here are a few ways to support your child’s vestibular sense:</p>
<ul><li>Spinning in circles.</li>
<li>Using a Merry-Go-Round.</li>
<li>Rolling down a hill.</li>
<li>Spinning on a swing.</li>
<li>Going upside down. </li>
<li>Climbing trees.</li>
<li>Rocking.</li>
<li>Jumping rope.</li>
<li>Summersaults or cartwheels.</li>
<li>Using monkey bars. </li>
<li>Skating.</li>
<li>Going backwards.</li>
<li>Swimming.</li>
<li>Dancing.</li>
<li>Wheel-barrel walks.”</li>
</ul><p>Yeeting kids, spinning them, flipping them upside down, tossing them in the air, and otherwise disrupting their balance temporarily, is Important For Their Development, specifically for their vestibular sense. </p>
<p>Kids love this because they NEED it. </p>
