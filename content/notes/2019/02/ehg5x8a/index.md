Might be travelling to the US for the first time later this year. Do console game prices really go so low over there? They're always pretty expensive over here (SE Asia), even used copies never go as low as a dollar. Would it be worth it for me to visit some stores and which stores would be good to visit? I'll be in california if that matters.
