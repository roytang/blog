#### Posted on r/Seattle: [A couple of tourist questions](https://reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/bzykkq/a_couple_of_tourist_questions/)

Hi,

&#x200B;

I'll be visiting Seattle for a few days later this month, a couple of questions, possibly noobish:

&#x200B;

\- I want to visit the museum of pop culture, but due to logistics and scheduling, I can only do this during a time when I need to be bringing around a small piece of luggage (on wheels), in addition to my backpack. Will they let me into the museum with the luggage? Or is it not a good idea to try this?

&#x200B;

\- my flight out of SeaTac is Southwest at 5am on a Tuesday. I plan to be at the airport maybe 9pm-10pm the night before, will they let me check in my luggage that early so that I can just hang out/sleep near the gate? (I guess this isn't really a Seattle-specific question, but more of I'm not sure if a US airport will let me do this. Where I'm from they typically won't let me check baggage more than 3 hours before my flight)

&#x200B;

Thanks!
