Ugh started out 1-2 at #mtgseattle. Time for the mythical 6-0 run!

<time>[04:01]</time> Damn it I forgot my own rules!

<time>[05:02]</time> Sigh. Dropped out of the #mtgseattle main event at 1-3. D: Deck didnt even want to play this time gave me 15 lands drawn in one game. Sad face

<time>[10:07]</time> It's okay to mess up. Don't dwell on it, learn what you can, and move on

<time>[10:35]</time> Very humbling that as i was dropping out of #MTGSeattle, Kai Budde, who's about the same age as me and started playing #MTG around the same time, made top 4 of the Mythic Championship, after having been semiretired for almost a decade!
