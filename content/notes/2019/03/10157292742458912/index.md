I mean, from their POV it's true, there is absolutely no benefit for poor or less capable candidates to participate in a debate, as it only highlights their weaknesses. Debates are for the benefit of the electorate, but I imagine the type of voters who would be inclined for the likes of Bato or Aguilar aren't the type to be swayed by debates. Pag may naghamon na maglaban na lang sa Tawag ng Tanghalan sa Showtime, baka pumayag pa sila (and it might even be effective, which says a lot about local politics)
