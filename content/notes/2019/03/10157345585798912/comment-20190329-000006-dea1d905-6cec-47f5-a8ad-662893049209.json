  "text": "My hypothesis is that lower quality candidates who rely only on popularity/ name recall (you know who they are) benefit from our system of voting 12 senators at large. With so many slots to fill and so many choices, voters will be less inclined to deep dive into the candidates. Whereas if we elected say 1-2 senators per region, from among a pool of maybe 4-6, lesser known but higher quality candidates might have a better chance",
