So, Manila Water (miss ko na mag bidet and shower). Catching up with all the "explanations" given out so far, the thing that makes the least sense for me is this: Supposedly MW is allocated 1600mld from Angat Dam, which is insufficient because the demand is at 1750mld. That's around a 9.375% deficit. Given that, why would it be necessary for a large number of areas (I'm not sure if there are even unaffected MW service areas) to have service interruptions for majority of the hours of the day? (Over here, I think we get like very weak water pressure a couple of hours a day and that's it). Obviously they can't just cut 9.375% of the hours, they need to add some buffer, that's fine. And households would of course compensate for reduced hours by consuming more during the time they do have water. But why so extreme, so immediately? At worst I would have expected that they cut service hours by at most 50% (so households have water during half the day), then if that's not enough come out with an advisory saying "okay, we're still consuming too much water, we need to cut more hours". As it is, their announced service interruption hours are highly inaccurate, so it seems they can't even predict what's going to happen with their service. Conspiracy theories aside, I prefer to attribute all of the issues to sheer incompetence first, but is there something I'm missing here, some kind of engineering reason or what, for the service interruptions to be so widespread and unpredictable?
