  "text": ">Let's not forget who controls the police and military back then.. wasn't it Fidel Marcos and JPE?\n\nActually, Fabian Ver was in charge of the military. From wikipedia: \" As Marcos disregarded the authority of then Defense Minister [Juan Ponce Enrile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Ponce_Enrile) in the 1980s, he changed the military [chain of command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy).  Under the new chain of command, the authority would evolve from Marcos  as president and commander-in-chief of the armed forces up to Ver, the  chief of staff of the armed forces. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRe: Marcoses, do you mean that you don't think they are corrupt? You don't think that Imee Marcos had Archimedes Trajano killed for speaking up against her? (There is already a court judgment on this)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>  People get fired and cases were filed iirc. Do you have anyone in mind? I have some means to get information. \n\nYung example ko above were the Tulfos? Is there any case against them now? I think the former sec of justice was also removed for some shenanigans, I forget his name, yung may wig? Ano nangyari sa kanya? Yan lang mga examples. Meron pa mga iba na tatanggalin nya for issues supposedly tapos irerecycle lang sa ibang position, like Faeldon or La Vina.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>  They don't offer alternative solution. And if they did, I didn't hear about it. \n\nSi Chel Diokno primarily judicial reform ang focus nya, since he is a lawyer. It is easy to search for it, here's the first article I found: [https://www.bworldonline.com/why-everyone-should-vote-for-chel-diokno/](https://www.bworldonline.com/why-everyone-should-vote-for-chel-diokno/)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"From his diagnostics, Chel has offered a coherent set of policy and  institutional reforms. The reforms he champions include the following:\n\n\u2022 The insulation of justices, judges, and prosecutors from partisan politics;\n\n\u2022 The filling up of vacancies in the  trial courts and prosecution agency by recruiting the most competent  lawyers who possess integrity;\n\n\u2022 The simplification of the rules on evidence and procedure;\n\n\u2022 The reorientation of performance standard for the police and prosecution toward achieving high conviction rates;\n\n\u2022 The creation of transparent information and monitoring system to track cases and convictions;\n\n\u2022 The transfer of police\u2019s disciplinary jurisdiction to the Civil Service Commission;\n\n\u2022 The expansion of the Ombudsman\u2019s scope to investigate justices and judges;\n\n\u2022 The strengthening of the law on witness protection by allowing the perpetuation of testimonies of whistleblowers.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI largely agree with this because I believe problems with the judicial system are one of the primary systemic problems in the country, facilitating corruption and delaying or outright denying justice especially to those with fewer resources. My impression is that this admin has shown little interest in improving judicial processes at all (despite the President being a former prosecutor who supposedly knows all the problems in the processes). Imagine if the so-called \"intelligence fund\" and/or political will was applied not just to identifying supposed drug users but instead to identifying corrupt judges, prosecutors, law enforcers, etc.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\>  First, I would suggest that you watch the full speech for all the  instances the president expressed support for all the topics listed  above. Again, half truths are the best lies. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPinapanood ko naman lahat. Are you saying hindi naman yun sinasabi nung president? Also, I'm not clear whether you are saying the media is engaged in half truths/lies or the president is?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\> Don't trust the media too  much. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the same vein, I think we should not trust any politician too much, whether we supported them or not. Discernment should apply to all sources, and even in cases where you trust someone, \"Trust, but verify\" should apply.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThank you for responding!",
