Oh wow, i would love to win this giveaway because i need to add a drive to my desktop so i can set up linux dual boot! Ive been wanting to slowly transition away from windows since all the ai shenanigans but i need more space to do so plus my secondary hdd (a 2tb seagate barracuda sshd) is already like 7yo at this point so i am worried it start having problems soon
