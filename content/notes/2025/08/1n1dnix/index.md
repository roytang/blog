#### Posted on r/MagicArena: [Midweek Magic: Pick-Two Draft doesn't let you pick 2 of the same card.](https://www.reddit.com/r/MagicArena/comments/1n1dnix/midweek_magic_picktwo_draft_doesnt_let_you_pick_2/)

I had a pack with 2 Etali and trying to pick both of them just resulted in a network error and the pack reloaded and I had to choose again. I tried this again a second time later with some uncommon that was also doubled in a pack, same issue. I guess midweek magic is a good way to beta test this sort of thing.
