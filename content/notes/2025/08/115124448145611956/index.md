<p>Last minute mythic on <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/MagicArena" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>MagicArena</span></a> tonight. Had to give up on my pet omniscience decks and switch to Vivi Cauldron to get there, still took a while. I wish Arena had an emote that was like &quot;Please let me win, I just need 1 more to rank up!!&quot;</p>
