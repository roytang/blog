How would it work with multiple devices? Does each device get its own keypair? But that means you would still need a traditional password as well, in order to do the initial auth and keypair generation on a new device?


Also, if your device is compromised or your phone is lost, doesnt that mean someone else will now have access to all your accounts that had passkeys stored on that device, without needing a passwors?
