We attended [Pop QUIZ! a Back-to-School themed Trivia Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1726406558237073)

This was one of their 9th anniversary events, so each team was given a bunch of giveaways.

Round breakdown:

- "Introduction to Psychology": 5pts
- Adulting 101: 6pts
- Advanced Chemical Linguistics: 8pts, x2 for power-up. The round involved spelling out the answers using elements from the periodic table.
- Poetry Analysis 103: 7pts + 1 bonus point - 4 points for failed gamble. The round involved identifying if a quote was from a poem or a song, with bonus points for correctly identifying the artist or poet.
- Applied Guesstimations: 3pts + 2pts bonus for exact answer. The round involved guessing large-valued numbers, with bonus points given to exact answers.
- Music Theory: 9pts. The round involved identifying the common theme between 4 song clips.

The rounds were very challenging for us and the failed gamble meant we ended up far from the top, a mere 7th among 9 teams.
