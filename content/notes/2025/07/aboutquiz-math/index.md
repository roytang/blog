We attended [The Limit Does Not Exist!: A Quiz Night About Mathematics](https://www.facebook.com/events/1258315569035064) at a new location, Kyodo Lounge at Robison's Magnolia.

This one was an 8-rounder with 2 power-ups! Round breakdown:

- 🧮 Arithmetic: 5pts x2 due to power-up
- ❌ Algebra: 0pts
- 🔷 Geometry: 4pts
- 📐 Trigonometry: 0pts
- 📈 Probability and Statistics: 4pts
- 👨‍🏫 Advanced Math: 1pt
- 🍾 Pop Culture Math: 3pts x2 due to power-up
- ⁉️ Math Trivia: 4pts

We did so terribly! I was expecting some level of problem solving, but not this much! Six out of the eight rounds were 99% problem solving! I should have gotten an idea when they provided us with copious amounts of scratch paper. Many of the problems required remembering procedures, theorems, or equations we have long forgotten! That meme of the lady trying to compute things was a very accurate way to describe how we felt for most of the night.

We finished a mere 7th out of 10 teams. Honestly i was happy we weren't in last place! And the competing teams all skewed young, probably college-level or a bit older, so we suspect they were mostly math majors or instructors. The top 2 teams were SOLO teams even!

I'm still kinda proud of the 20% of the actual math problems I was able to solve, mostly by myself. There were also a few where I knew how to get there but I made some dumb arithmetic mistakes (unsurprising), and a few where we got there most of the way, but needed some missing info to complete the solution.

Quiz nights these week have been hard!
