title: 'Back to School - STEM Edition: A Quiz Night about Science & Technology, Engineering and Mathematics'
---

We attended another AboutQuiz quiz night at Saludo's! 

[Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1263496038647719)

Round by round breakdown:

- 🧫 Biology (spelling round) - 4pts
- 🧮 Mathematics - 6pts. There were 2 questions where we had to solve problems on paper again!
- 💊 Anatomy & Medicine - 5pts
- ⌨️ Computer & Technology - 6pts, x2 for power-up
- 🧪 Chemistry (before and after) - 5pts
- 🪐 Earth Science & Astronomy - 4pts
- 🫸 Physics (anagrams) - 14pts
- 👷 Engineering (pictograms) - 7pts
- Pabibo: Mohs hardness scale - 1pt

We were once again in clear first place before the Pabibo round, so I only wagered one point lol. So far, we have attended quiz night at Saludo's 3 times this year and won every time! Too bad the prizes aren't great though.
