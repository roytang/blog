<p><span class="h-card" translate="no"><a href="https://mastodon.world/@jikomayo" class="u-url mention">@<span>jikomayo</span></a></span> i had a weeks-long customer support with over this reverification because my legal name on my id did not match my account name sa maya and i had to do a change of name process which involved submitting a birth certificate which they ridiculously refused to accept at first because i submitted a scanned image and not a photo. It was kind of a waste of time but i had the documents already so i just powered through it lol</p>
