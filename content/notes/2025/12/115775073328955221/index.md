<p>After playing <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/EternalCardGame" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>EternalCardGame</span></a> for something like 8.5 years, I finally completed all the Steam Achievements!</p><p>(There are a few more achievements in-game, but honestly that might take another decade or so lol)</p>
