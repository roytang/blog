title: Pisay B2K Quiz Night @ Gacha

I attended [B2K: Battle 2 Know Quiz Night](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=122148065636523831&set=a.122104433474523831) @ [GACHA](https://maps.app.goo.gl/MRQXQkK83DYtTpVf6). This was a fundraising event by PSHS batch 2000. The usual trivia team opted against attending this (the entrance fee was expensive!) but my PSHS batchmates wanted to join, so I went along with them.

The place was packed, and mostly with PSHS alumni (not surprising). The round by round breakdown:

- science and math: 8pts
- brand logos: 4pts
- sports GOATs: 7pts
- hollywood hits: 8pts
- national flags: 2pts
- pinoy tv: 0pts
- PH provincial capital cities: 7pts
- song lyrics: 6pts

The first few rounds weren't too difficult, and we even did surprisingly well in the sports round, which we expected might be a problem. We were actually tied for first place after the 4th round! And then, disaster struck and the flags round and the pinoy TV round just tore us apart, and we ended up finishing tied for last place D:

This event also had a very audacious pay-to-win mechanic: after the 8 regular rounds there would be a bonus round with 5 questions worth 2 points each, but in order to particpate, teams had to buy the right to answer those questions. The first opportunity to buy was after round 2; each team could buy 1 bonus question at P100 each, or all 5 at P400 in all (20% discount). And then every two rounds, you have another chance to buy BUT THE PRICE INCREASES EVERY TIME!! After the eighth round, the bonus questions were P250 each! I understand it's a fundraiser, but that still seems ick lol. Anyway, after round 4 we were so behind there wasn't any point buying in!

Not too fond of the venue: they took forever to serve 3 of the 4 burgers we ordered, and the prices are quite expensive. 

Overall even though we did terribly it was a fun night and a good chance to reconnect with the batchmates.
