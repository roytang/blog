We attended another AboutQuiz quiz night at Saludo's! 

[Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1344736346786768)

Round by round breakdown:

- R1: Foreign Languages - 4pts
- R2: Business - 7pts
- R3: Performing Arts - 6pts
- R4: Vocational Education - 4pts
- R5: Visual Arts - 8pts (x2 for best joker): This round was very fun because they made bad reproductions of classic artworks that we had to identify and we were all laughing so hard
- R6: Adulting 101 - 8pts
- Pabibo: Electoral positions - 2pts

We were in clear first place before the Pabibo round, so once again we only wagered enough to make sure we won, and this was an easy round so we got there easily. We ended up winning the whole event with 1pt! Our AboutQuiz attendance for this year has been spotty, but so far we have won every AboutQuiz we have attended, 100% win rate! (2 out of 2 lol)

Afterwards I complained to the host about the prize voucher only being valid for 3 weeks but they said it was the request of the venue partner (unsurprising). They also had some slides from a recent Seventeen (K-Pop group) quiz night they had that they ran at the request of some of my teammates.
