Attendance: Me, Liz, Chi, Jaime, Cole, Macho

We attended a games-themed PopQuiz at a new venue this Thursday. The venue was Quantum Neon mini-golf at Home Depot Ortigas. They have a sister restaurant calle Xin Xin.

Rounds were:

1. Sports Goats - 7pts
2. Video Game Bosses - 5pts x2 for powerup
3. Boardgame Meeples - 9pts
4. Sports in Pop Culture - 4pts
5. Video Game Music - 9pts x2 for ace. This was a fun round. We missed the Breath of the Wild main theme because honestly that seems kinda forgettable.
6. Boardgame Rules - 9pts
7. (Hail Mary) Hollywood actors in video games - 7pts
8. (Tiebreaker) PBA Teams - we won the tiebreak!

We had a terrible power-up, but with a successful ace we were still able to tie for first place. The tiebreaker was a sports question, luckily we had a sports guy! We won a voucher for free minigolf for 4!

Fun things:

- while trying to identify a hollywood actor who played Cal Kestis in Jedi Survivor: I describe him and Liz knows who I'm talking about and writes down "Dominic Monaghan" and I'm like "Wait, isn't that a hobbit?" and she quickly erases the first name and luckily they accepted it.
- struggling to remember what the name of Red Guardian's actor was and at the last second just writing "Red Guardian"
