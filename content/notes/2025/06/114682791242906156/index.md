<p>I think I read something like if when you try some new thing and then you&#39;re not immediately good at it and you find that annoying/disappointing/discouraging, that this is a sign of <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/ADHD" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>ADHD</span></a> or <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/Neurodivergence" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>Neurodivergence</span></a> or something like that. How true is this?</p>
