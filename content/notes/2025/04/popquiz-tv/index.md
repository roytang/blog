Attendance: Me, Liz, Chi, Chry, Chery

We attended a TV PopQuiz at Int/Ext this Thursday. This is only my second quiz night for the year!

Rounds were:

1. Actors - 5pts
2. Animated Theme Songs - 8pts
3. Reality TV - 7pts x0 for failed ace
4. Actresses - 4pts
5. Original Song - 9pts
6. Plots - 6pts x2 for power up
7. (Hail Mary) Emmy Winners of Best Comedy/Drama Series since 2010

We thought we were dead after the failed ace in R3 (we were expecting a Drag Race question which our teammates could handle easily; we did not get that), but somehow still managed to finish in 3rd place. The first place team was so far ahead, in order for us to have won, we would have needed to get the ace question AND get a couple more points from elsewhere.
