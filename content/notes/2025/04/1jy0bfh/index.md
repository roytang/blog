#### Posted on r/ps2: [Help trying to get an old PS2 to work](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/comments/1jy0bfh/help_trying_to_get_an_old_ps2_to_work/)



We found an old PS2 in our house in storage from who knows how many years ago. I wanted to get it running primarily to check if there were any save games of interest on the memory card. I hooked up everything and I used an old monitor we had which still had AV inputs. The PS2 boots and the controller works (the red light lights up) and it makes the PS2 boot sounds, but the video looks like this (see image) and fades to black after a while. I tried it also on our LG TV, but on the TV it wouldn't even show any video (though the startup sounds are still there). At first I thought maybe the cable is faulty, so I bought a new one (I found them for sale cheap online), but even the replacement had the same behavior.

Does it mean the PS2's video out is broken? Or is it just some issue with NTSC/PAL resolutions? Anything I can do? Or is there a way I can read/view the memory card contents from my PC directly?

If it matters, most likely the unit has a modchip (the vast majority of PS2s in our area from that era were modded)
