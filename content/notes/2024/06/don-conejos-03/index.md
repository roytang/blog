We attended our third quiz night at Don Conejos. It was a rainy evening, and Jason was a bit late this time.

This night's categories and our scores were:

1. "Back to school" -> Fictional schools: 10pts
2. "Grey's Anatomy" -> Human anatomy: 10pts
3. "Fowl territory" -> Chickens: 6pts
4. "Elementary" -> Sherlock Holmes: 9pts (x2 for joker)
5. "Mugging for the Camera" -> Celebrity Mug Shots (visual): 6pts
6. "How Things Work" -> Technology: 5pts
7. "He's got it all" -> Brad Pitt: 8pts
8. "How Deep Is Your Love" -> Songs with "Love" in the title (audio): 14pts

We did extremely well! We finished with a clear lead over the other teams.
