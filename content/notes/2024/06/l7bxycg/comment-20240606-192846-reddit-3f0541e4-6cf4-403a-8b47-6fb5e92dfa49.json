  "text": "Oh this is such a thing, and I don\u2019t understand nor do I agree with the logic. \n\nAdjectiveless X-Men does indeed have its own legacy numbering. Without having all the details in front of me, it\u2019s essentially the numbering from Claremont and Lee\u2019s 1991 X-Men #1 through Morrison\u2019s New X-Men, Carey\u2019s X-Men Legacy, and maybe Spurrier\u2019s(?) renumbered X-Men Legacy featuring Legion all totaling up to 300 issues, none of them featuring \u201cUncanny\u201d in the title. Apologies if I\u2019ve left anything out there. \n\nUncanny X-Men numbering includes everything from Lee and Kirby\u2019s 1963 X-Men #1 (even though many of these issues do not include \u201cUncanny\u201d in the title, that didn\u2019t start until issue 142) along with Gillen\u2019s, Bendis\u2019, Bunn\u2019s, and Brisson & Rosenberg\u2019s relaunches (again apologies if I\u2019m leaving some out). This totals to somewhere just north of 600 (I think ~641 but could be wrong). This is all generally accepted as making some degree of logical sense. \n\nHow we get to 700 is less straightforward. \u201cUncanny\u201d now includes the three issue War of the Realms Uncanny X-Men limited series (OK it has \u201cUncanny\u201d in the title and during those months was the only Uncanny series), along with Hickman\u2019s 21 issues and Duggan\u2019s 35 issues of \u201cX-Men\u201d. Those last two runs are specifically adjectiveless yet they go to Uncanny numbering.\n\nWhat irks me most though is that there was another choice here. While I get why Marvel would maybe not do this, they could have included the 300 issues of X-Men with the 700 issues of \u201cUncanny\u201d and made issue 35 of the current series legacy number X-Men #1000. My brain gravitates to this mostly because you\u2019re not adding an \u201cUncanny\u201d where it\u2019s not, but it would have denied publishing an issue 700, 800, and 900. \n\nAnyway\u2026 this is where we are and I am clearly displaying some deep feelings here. As a philosopher once said \u201cthe numbers don\u2019t lie, and they spell disaster for you.\u201d",
