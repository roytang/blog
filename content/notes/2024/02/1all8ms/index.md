#### Posted on r/Stellaris: [Haven't played since 2020, have there been a lot of base game changes? Which DLC would be good to get?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/1all8ms/havent_played_since_2020_have_there_been_a_lot_of/)

Thinking of giving it another go. I only have Utopia and Apocalypse. If I could only get one of the other available DLCs, which one would be most interesting?
