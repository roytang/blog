title: 'Popquiz Trivia Night: Sexy Halloween'
---

Attendance: Me, Cole, Liz+2

It's been a couple of months, but we managed to attend another quiz night at the end of October. This one was themed around occupations that were often used as sexy halloween costumes. We had no expectations for this one; I just missed going out for quiz nights honestly.

Rounds were:

1. Teachers and Librarians - 8pts
2. Construction Workers/Engineers - 5pts
3. Priests and Nuns - 2pts
4. Doctors and Nurses - 9pts
5. Police/Military - 6pts (x2 for joker)
6. Maids/Butlers and Servers - 5pts
7. (Hail Mary) Identify the punny costumes - 3pts
8. (Tie breaker: Did not affect us) Village people songs

The scores were super close among the three teams, but we were the only one who didn't use the Ace so we ended up a few points behind the other 2 teams that tied. If only we were more brave!
