#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Iron Fist question](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/1dxhaua/iron_fist_question/)

Hi, I'm reading through Iron Fist stuff.

In Iron Fist #73 (Oct 2017), Danny has Shou-Lao in a hidden dragon den in his condo building, feeding him cows. I don't know how/why Shou-Lao got there?!?

The last thing I remember is that at the end of Iron Fist: The Living Weapon #12 (May 2015), Pei brought back all 66 previous versions of Shou-Lao, and Luke and Danny say they'll handle it, but I don't think them handling the dragons was ever shown anywhere either?!? Pei's story continues in Immortal Iron Fists #1, but there's no mention there of what happened to the dragons.

I am not sure if I missed some Iron Fist-related thing or event in between IF:TLW and IIF by Kaare Andrews and Iron Fist (2017) by Ed Brisson.
