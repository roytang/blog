Last Wednesday, quiz host Jason said he was hosting at Don Conejos again the next day. A bit last minute, but I wanted to get out of the house to do something enjoyable after an exhausting past few days, so I asked the team to go.

This night's categories and our scores were (I was unable to note all the misleading category names):

1. movies with numbers in title - 10pts
2. anatomy - 6pts
3. "The China Crisis" -> china - 9pts
4. voice actors - 7pts
5. "Real Steel" -> superman - 5pts: even though I'm a comics guy, this round was a bit too deep cut for me!
6. fictional geography - 8pts
7. "Secret Identities" -> real names of celebrities - 9pts (x2 for joker): We reserved our joker for this one, assuming it would be a superheroes thing, but apparently not.
8. songs by one-named artists - 18pts

Not a lot of competition this time, the only other veteran quiz team that regularly attends arrived a round a half late, so we easily won this one.
