title: 'Popquiz 8: The Power of Friendship'
---

We attended the Pop Quiz 8th anniversary quiz night at Int/Ext, themed around friendship. This was originally supposed to be scheduled last Wednesday and was a two-part event with the Deadpool and Wolverine screening I attended last week, but the quiz night had to be pushed due to weather problems.

Attendance: Me, C, S, DJ+2.

Seven main rounds this time, plus the Hail Mary. For their anniversary quiz, they have the "choose your own adventure" mechanic where for EVERY QUESTION the teams would vote to pick among four subcategories: People/Characters, Events, Places, or Things/Creatures. This meant the quiz ran much later than usual, we finished around 11:30pm.

Also, their Ace mechanic has been changed to "Gamble" where you choose how many points to wager for the 10th question. It's a bit confusing.

The categories were each different topics that relate to friendship (very loosely). Here's how we did:

1. Pokemon - 3pts. We had a pokemon guy, but they were late so we only got the last 3 questions
2. Marvel - 9pts, x2 for power up. I missed a question about Miley Cyrus' character in GotG2 because it took me forever to remember the character name and I just wrote "YuNG COMPUTER" lol
3. Friends - 7pts
4. Taylor Swift - 3pts. I actually answered one here!
5. BTS - 9pts
6. X-Men - 9pts + 8 for gamble (maybe?). That's right, they had a Marvel round AND an X-Men round. I missed a question about the 1989 MS-DOS game [X-Men: Madness in Murderworld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men%3A_Madness_in_Murderworld) (what a deep cut!) but confidently gambled as much as I can (or assumed I can) on the final question.
7. Disney - 7pts
8. (Hail Mary) Deadpool and Wolverine - 9pts. That's right, on top of the Marvel AND X-Men round, we got a round specifically about the movie as well. They promised only light spoilers but I'm still glad I'd already seen thefilm at this point.

In the end it was a close top 3, but we managed to come out ahead thanks to the confident gamble lol.s
