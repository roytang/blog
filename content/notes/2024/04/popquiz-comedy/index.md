I think this is our first time back at the Vault for the year? The quiz wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, but we screwed up the Ace, using it on the one round where we missed the Ace question. If we had used it on any other round we would have won, but instead we ended up tied for third place (we won the tiebreak, which was to name people who had hosted the Oscars more than once!)

Rounds were:

1. TV comedies - 7pts
2. Sketch/improv comedy - 9pts
3. Funny movies - 10pts (x2 for powerup)
4. Memes - 7pts (x0 for failed ace)
5. Comedians - 7pts
6. Song parodies - 8pts
