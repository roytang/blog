 The Rock has joined the franchise! I enjoyed the ensemble cast coming together (but how is Han alive?!? And that other person?!?) and the stunts and action set pieces were good as usual, though I suspect there are some laws of physics being violated in there somewhere. It helps my suspension of disbelief that I don't know much about driving - but the film never takes itself too seriously anyway. I also liked the transition from a street racing focus to a heist focus, as I generally enjoy heist films anyway.
