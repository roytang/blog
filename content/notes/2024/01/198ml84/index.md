#### Posted on r/Philippines: [I'm trying to remember an old Filipino movie from the 80s (or possibly early 90s)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/198ml84/im_trying_to_remember_an_old_filipino_movie_from/)

Baka may makatulong. I remember we watched it in the province; very rarely lang kami manood ng Filipino movie nuon. Some details I remember are:

- andun si Aiza
- may ninjas (?!?) or something similar
- meron isang scene na madilim sa gubat na may kalaban sila na "alien"/"monster", but they used a Transformer toy to represent it. I remember this part kasi mahilig na ko sa Transformers toys nun so I recognized it (It was one of the G1 Predacons)

The first two suggest it might be "Me and Ninja Liit" (1988), but that movie is on YT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2a5epNtXI1c) and the scene I describe above doesn't seem to be there, so baka ibang sine sya?!? Or did I combine two different movies in my memory?!?
