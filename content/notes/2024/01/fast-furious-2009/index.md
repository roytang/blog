Action set pieces are still on point, but the plot here felt a bit contrived to be able to bring Dom and Brian on the same page, with a twist you could see coming. Oh and also not sure if I just wasn't paying enough attention, but there was a part here about a fingerprint lookup that didn't make sense?!?
