"I think we went past ridiculous 3 or 4 movies ago."

Sooo many over the top stunts! Still fun to watch, as long as you try not to make too much sense of everything.

Feels like Dom accepting the whole God's Eye plan was unnecessary, Shaw wasn't hard to find, he kept coming at them. Deckard Shaw acts much more like a blunt instrument compared to his brother.

I kind of assumed they would kill off Brian due to Paul Walker's death, but apparently not? I suppose I'll see what happens to him in the next film. His face looks a bit weird in some of his scenes here, probably because they just cgi'ed him onto the standins.
