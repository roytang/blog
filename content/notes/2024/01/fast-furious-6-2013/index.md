Found this one a bit boring compared to the last one, at least until the final set of action set pieces at the end of the film. And ok, the tank reveal was fun. Still need to suspend a lot of disbelief! Tanks can't go that fast! This can't happen before Tokyo Drift, they still had flip phones there, this timeline makes no sense! And the weird height perspective scene between The Rock and Vin Diesel is here lol. I will admit to being entertained though, so maybe that's enough.
