I attended a quiz night at a new venue with a new host, with another trivia team this time. Some HS batchmates wanted to attend this Batang 90s quiz and I volunteered to come along, because I wanted to check out this trivia host, Trivia Down Tuesdays. The regular trivia team had attended one of their quizzes before, pre-pandemic, but it seemed like they had changed their style and format a lot recently so I wanted to check it out. And they now have quizzes every day of the week (they have multiple people doing the hosting) instead of just Tuesdays! For this particular quiz, the venue was at 225 Bistro along Katipunan extension.

Only 3 teams attended, but we did not do very well, finishing a distant 2nd place. The main problem was that the questions were mainly focused on local (PH) content - celebrities, movies, TV shows, etc - and I'm not especially good at that kind of thing, so I wasn't much help.

Their format was 9 rounds with 7pts each. Round by round breakdown:

- R1 History - 4pts
- R2 Celebs - 5pts
- R3 Identify the song (audio round) - 6pts (Bonus: +5 for having a rep sing in front of everyone)
- Break
- R4 Name the cartoon character (visual round) - 5pts
- R5 Name the TV show (visual round) - 3pts
- R6 Name the movie (visual round) - 3pts
- Break
- R7 Name the company based on 90s logo (visual round) - 6pts
- R8 Name the local ad (audio round) - 5pts
- R9 Philippine games (charades WTH) - 6pts

The team rankings were:

1. team 12 - 65pts
2. lechon rice 95 (that's us!) - 48pts
3. gwapitos - 45pts

Overall, not too enamored with this host's format. A lot of the questions were very simple/straightforward "name the thing", unlike some of the other quizzes we attend where there's usually some kind of trickiness or cross-domain puzzling to be done. Not sure if I'd attend again.
