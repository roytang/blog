Attendance: Me, Cole, Jaime, Faith, Chery

We attended a Disney-themed PopQuiz at the Vault this Wednesday. This is the last quiz night I can attend for the year. The venue was packed; Disney always draws huge crowds.

Rounds were:

1. Heroes - 6pts (x2 for power-up)
2. Sidekicks - 8pts
3. Soundtracks - 6pts
4. Villains - 7pts
5. Locations - 15pts (with wager)
6. Disney Songs / Lyrics - 17pts (out of 20)
7. (Hail Mary) Questions about upcoming films Moana 2 and Mufasa - 5pts

We were behind the eventual winning team and sadly only finished in 4th place.
