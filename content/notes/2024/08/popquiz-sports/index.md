title: 'Popquiz Trivia Triathlon: Sports-themed Trivia Night'
---

Attendance: Me, Cole, Liz+3

We attended another quiz night this week. I had low expectations for this one because sports! Only four teams attended.

Rounds were:

1. Boxing - 6pts
2. Soccer - 6pts
3. Basketball - 8pts
4. Winter Sports - 5pts
5. Olympics - 5pts
6. Fictional Sports - 4pts (x2 for joker)
7. (Hail Mary: Did not participate) ???
8. (Tie breaker: Did not affect us) Enumerate PH Olympic Medalists

It turns out the rest of the teams had low expectations as well and we somehow still won despite no Hail Mary, no Ace, and using the joker power-up on our lowest-scoring round!
