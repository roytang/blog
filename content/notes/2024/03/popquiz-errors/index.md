title: 'Popquiz: The Errors Tour'
---

First popquiz for the year! This quiz was not entirely Taylor Swift-themed though that was a strong component. Alas, our Ace went poorly and with it our chance of winning the event. We ended up finishing 3rd out of 5 teams which wasn't too bad (still got a prize!)

Rounds were:

1. Fearless Women in Pop Culture - 7? points, x0 because of failed Ace
2. Cottagecore in Pop Culture - 4pts
3. Paint the Town Red - 8pts
4. Epic Fails and Faux Pas - 5pts
5. References of Time - 5pts
6. The Year 1989 - 8pts x2 for joker
7. (Hail Mary): Name the TS songs from foreign language covers - 5pts
