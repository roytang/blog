We attended a Disney/Pixar movie themed quiz night at a new venue (new for us), Cinema 76 Cafe. The venue was a combination of cafe + a small theatre were they screened a couple of movies a day. 

While this quiz still followed the usual whiteboard answer format as our other quiz nights, it was a bit more strict. Spelling/punctuation had to be accurate, and we had to put our phones into a white box they gave us while the rounds were ongoing!

There were 4 regular rounds and 2 bonus rounds with I think 15 questions each. 

- Round 1: Name the movie (given anagrams or cast members or characters) - 8pts
- Round 2: Name the movie (given a short soundtrack clip) - 8pts
- Round 3: Disney Awards and Numbers - 8pts
- Bonus round 1: Telepathy - 3pts
- Round 4: General Disney trivia - 12pts
- Bonus round 2: x5 multipler - 100pts (!!)

The telepathy round was where one member of each team was separated and the rest of us had to have the same answer as our corresponding team representative to questions like "Name a Disney princess" or "Name a talking Disney animal". We did not do so well here!

The second bonus round was kind of random, and I didn't really like the bonus multiplier because it kind of made the rest of the rounds insignificant by comparison!

We were just barely leading for most of the game, and managed to win in the end. Prizes were free movie tickets + popcorn that we can use anytime this week, plus some movie-themed swag.

We did enjoy the quiz night, and the host was pretty good, so we will probably be coming back.
