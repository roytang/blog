<p>I love RSS, but one thing I don&#39;t like is that readers typically homogenize the appearance of posts from different sources, which is fine that&#39;s how aggregators work. But I miss seeing the flair of individual websites so I often find myself clicking thru entries to see their site designs. I kind of want a stylesheet element in the RSS feeds and feed readers could have a toggle where you can view each feed&#39;s entries with their custom styles. I understand how that could break things though.</p>
