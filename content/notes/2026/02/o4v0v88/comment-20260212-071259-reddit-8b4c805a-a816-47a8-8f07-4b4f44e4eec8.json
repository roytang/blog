  "text": "You solved it homie, thanks! The issue was the disc - it's the same disc as before but it was region 3, so I needed to download using my HK account instead, even though the save was for my US account. (I was confused by the fact that my US account had also downloaded the DLCs before for whatever reason.)\n\nI have successfully loaded my save. Thanks again!",
