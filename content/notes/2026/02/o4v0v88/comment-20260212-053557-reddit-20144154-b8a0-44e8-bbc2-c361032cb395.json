  "text": "Saved data and DLC are region locked on PlayStation. A USA game requires USA DLC.\n\nWaiting to install means you need to launch the game to install the DLC. If it won't install after that, it means your game and DLC are from different regions.\n\nMore info:\n\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/1pmz1k4/general_questions_tech_support_megathread/nu547h1/\n\nHowever there's also 2 versions of Witcher 3 in each region. A GotY with all DLC included and Wild Hunt which does require all that DLC downloaded separately.",
