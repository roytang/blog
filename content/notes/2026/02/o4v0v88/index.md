Hello,

I'm trying to run Witcher 3 and load my old saves from 2015 which are still on the PS4. I still have the disc and installed and updated the game. But when I try to load my saves, the game says I don't have a bunch of DLC needed in the save. Looks like it was some free updates like "Neutral Gwent Card Set", "New Quest - Where the Cat and Wolf Play...", etc.

I can see them listed if I go to Playstation Store -> Library -> Purchases -> The Witcher 3 and download them one at a time. But after I download them they are shown in the download list as "waiting to install..." and they never install. I try to click one and choose "Start" (the only other option is "Cancel and Delete"), but when I do that it says "Cannot find the application. Do you want to look in PlayStation Store?" and clicking OK in this dialog just loads the store page for that DLC and it says I have purchased it.

Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
