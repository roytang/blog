<p>Today in trying to dig up the past:</p><p>Found an old 1TB SATA hard drive in storage that was probably from 2 PCs ago (pre-2015), and I was excited! What treasures I might be able to find in there! But I needed an enclosure for it, so I ordered one and it arrived after a few days, and to my disappointment the drive was empty and the Disks program says it is &quot;likely to fail soon&quot; D: Sad.</p>

<time id="116091484636033277">[19:51]</time> <p>I also found two 40gb IDE hard drives, which are most likely from two PCs I bought in 2003, and of course I also wanted to see what was there. I already had an IDE enclosure so I was able to check immediately, but these couldn&#39;t even be read sadly.</p><p>But I was able to recover some files from a 160gb hard drive we used from around 2009-2014, but it looks like things I&#39;ve already archived before, although I&#39;m happy to dig into it to check</p>
