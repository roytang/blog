Today feels like a good day to try to install [#linux](https://indieweb.social/tags/linux) dual boot and potentially screw up my windows partition

<time id="115890867619414992">[09:31]</time> [#linux](https://indieweb.social/tags/linux) installation success! Windows still seems to be working properly as well. Now for the hard/fun part: setting up and logging in to all my stuff again
