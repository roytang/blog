There is a general strategy for draft (see guides like https://draftsim.com/mtg-draft-guide/): pick powerful cards first, try to read signals, make sure your deck has a good mana curve, try to find an open lane, etc. 

There can also be format-specific quirks depending on the set being drafted. You do need some level of familiarity with the draft environment (what cards are in the sets, what are the archetypes for each color pair etc). There are guides available online for specific sets.
