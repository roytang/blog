| # | Title | Release Year | Date Watched | Notes | Rating (out of 5) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sicario | 2015 | Jan 05 | Great thriller movie, but the lesson here is so bleak | 5 |
| 2 | Paprika | 2006 | Jan 08 | Colorful, vivid and great animation but so so bizaare | 4 |
| 3 | Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) | 2014 | Jan 08 | Insanely good, I can see why it won best picture | 5 |
| 4 | Looper | 2012 | Jan 09 | Entertaining enough, but raises so many time travel questions | 4 |
| 5 | John Wick 2 | 2017 | Jan 12 | Better than I expected | 5 |
| 6 | Ad Astra | 2019 | Jan 13 | Kinda draggy | 3.5 |
| 7 | Klaus | 2019 | Jan 13 | Surprisingly good. Fantastic animation | 5 |
| 8 | Marriage Story | 2019 | Jan 14 | Great performances. Ma didn't like the ending. | 5 |
| 9 | Fist of Fury | 1972 | Jan 14 | Great fight scenes. Actually a bit more plot than I expected | 5 |
| 10 | Coming to America | 1988 | Jan 15 | I had low expectations, but it was better than I thought it would be. Ma would like it! | 3.5 |
| 11 | MIB International | 2019 | Jan 15 | Kind of predictable | 3 |
| 12 | Batman vs TMNT | 2019 | Jan 16 | Ridiculous, but fun. Good for kids. | 4 |
| 13 | 6 Underground | 2019 | Jan 17 | The editing and scene transitions were all over the place. A very Michael Bay film. | 3.5 |
| 14 | The Wolf of Wall Street | 2013 | Jan 18 | This movie does nothing to improve my opinion of modern capitalism. | 4.5 |
| 15 | Parasite | 2019 | Jan 19 | Really good, but IDK how to begin to describe it. Worth overcoming the 1 inch subtitle barrier for. | 5 |
| 16 | Kiki's Delivery Service | 1989 | Feb 04 | Very light-hearted and idyllic. At first it felt a bit boring, but it had me smiling by the end. | 5 |
| 17 | Uncut Gems | 2019 | Feb 07 | Sandler gave a good performance, but I struggled to get through the early parts of the movies because his character and situation are so unrelatable to me personally. | 4 |
| 18 | Knives Out | 2019 | Feb 09 | A fantastic murder mystery, maybe the best I've ever seen, great performances all around. | 5 |
| 19 | Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World | 2003 | Feb 10 | Watched this because a redditor said ROTK robbed it of best picture in 2003. This is a great war movie, but he was wrong | 5 |
| 20 | Jojo Rabbit | 2019 | Feb 11 | Best movie about a Nazi ever. Most colorful depiction of Nazi Germany. Fantastic movie. | 5 |
| 21 | Superman: Red Son | 2020 | Feb 27 | An acceptable adaptation of one of my favorite Superman stories. Minus points for not including the "House of L" epilogue. | 4 |
| 22 | Coach Carter | 2005 | Feb 27 | I watched this because I saw it in a "top inspirational speeches" YT video. Pretty good sports movie. | 4 |
| 23 | Billy Madison | 1995 | Mar 23 | Watched this so I know the context of the "I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul" clip. Typical early Sandler movie. | 3 |
| 24 | Princess Mononoke | 1997 | Mar 23 | Much more action-packed than the last Ghibli movie I watched. Beautifully animated. | 5 |
| 25 | Birds of Prey and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn | 2020 | Mar 25 | [Spoiler-free review](/2020/03/birds-of-prey/) | 4 |
| 26 | Logan Lucky | 2017 | Mar 25 | Fun heist movie, but I find it hard to take the characters seriously. Might be some anti-redneck bias. | 4 |
| 27 | The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey | 2012 | Mar 30 | See below | 4 |
| 28 | The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug | 2013 | Apr 07 | See below | 4 |
| 29 | [Project 88: Back to the Future Too](https://www.bttftoo.com/) | 2020 | Apr 10 | Fantastic fan-made shot-by-shot recreation of Back to the Future II, put together during quarantine, w/ stop motion, kids, sock puppets, bananas, potatoes and much more! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GcUUjWbVc4I | 5 |
| 30 | The Hobbit: Battle of the Five Armies | 2014 | Apr 10 | This trilogy had far too many extra things that weren't in the books, but it was pretty good. I rank them Desolation > Five Armies > Journey. | 4 |
| 31 | The Departed | 2006 | Apr 10 | This was intense. I liked it more than Goodfellas. | 5 |
| 32 | Spirited Away | 2001 | Apr 15 | Shades of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard of Oz. Easily the best Ghibli film I've watched so far. | 5 |
| 33 | Psych the Movie | 2017 | May 03 | It's like an extended episode of Psych! | 4 |
| 34 | Ready Player One | 2018 | May 05 | A predictable yet fun romp. | 4 |
| 35 | The Siege | 1998 | May 05 | Caught this on Cinemax when I went down for lunch. Much too idealistic in hindsight, given what happened in New York 3 years after this film released. | 3 |
| 36 | Kong: Skull Island | 2017 | May 07 | Exciting popcorn movie. | 4 |
| 37 | Ang Huling El Bimbo: The Musical | 2019 | May 08 | Ok, so this one isn't really a movie. The appeal for me is mostly the music and the nostalgia. The plot was serviceable, though some may find it problematic. | 4 |
| 38 | Justice League Dark: Apokolips War | 2020 | May 15 | This was great, and appropriatly dark. Good send-off for the DCAMU. | 4 |
| 39 | Zombieland Double Tap | 2019 | May 27 | A fun romp, but pretty much more of the same. | 3 |
| 40 | Sonic the Hedgehog | 2019 | Jun 27 | Fun with Ben Schwartz, but James Marsden's character is kinda dumb. Needs a lot of suspension of disbelief. | 3 |
| 41 | Mission Impossible Fallout | 2018 | Jun 29 | Good watch, it's MI, you know how it goes. Maybe 40% of it is Tom Cruise running.  | 3 |
| 42 | Atomic Blonde | 2017 | Jul 11 | I came in thinking it was a John Wick style action movie. True, but it's also a Cold War spy thriller. Nice twists, but might be a bit hard to follow near the end. | 3 |
| 43 | The Old Guard | 2020 | Jul 12 | Didn't know what to expect, never read the Greg Rucka graphic novel on which it was based. Action-packed, fun watch. | 4 |
| 44 | Superman Man of Tomorrow | 2020 | Aug 28 | Not too good. Weird animation. Writing all over the place. | 3 |
| 45 | Bill and Ted Face the Music | 2020 | Aug 29 | A most excellent sequel, echoing the earlier two movies. A midlife crisis journey full of heart and time travel nonsense. Little Billie and Theda are great!  | 5 |
| 46 | Enola Holmes | 2020 | Sep 27 | It's okay. Basically young adult/Nancy Drew Sherlock Holmes, with a bit of feminism thrown in. Mycroft annoying as usual. | 3 |
