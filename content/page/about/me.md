**About Roy Tang**

- I'm from the [Philippines](/tags/philippines) (GMT+8)
- Technically, this entire site is about me (and my thoughts), so this page is a bit redundant. Maybe that alone already tells you everything you need to know?
- [programmer, engineer, scientist, critic, gamer, dreamer, and kid-at-heart](/2006/02/programmer-engineer-scientist-critic-gamer-dreamer-and-kid-at-heart/)
- Frustrated writer and [sketch artist](/album/sketchbook/)
- [Magic](/tags/mtg) player on weekends
- [Software developer](/tags/software-development/) since 2003. If you'd like to work with me, take a look at my [resume](/resume).
- Topics I am generally interested in at the moment:
  - technology
  - software development
  - self-improvement
  - gaming, movies and tv
  - puns
  - possible solutions to our impending doom
- The picture of me wearing dice on my head has been my go to profile pic for a while. It was taken back in 2008 when I still worked a regular job.
