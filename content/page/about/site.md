**About roytang.net**

- [roytang.net](https://roytang.net) is a personal site, an [E/N site](http://sawv.org/en.html), and kind of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)
- I post about a random assortment of topics that interest me including [software development](/tags/software-development/), [Magic the Gathering](/tags/magic-the-gathering/), [pop culture](/tags/pop-culture), [gaming](/tags/gaming), and [tech life](tags). This site is [perpetually under renovation](/2019/08/perpetually-under-renovation/).
- I've had a site on the internet since around 2001, in some form or another. 
- I've had the domain roytang.net [since 2006](/2006/02/welcome-to-roytang-net/). 
- You can view a [changelog](/tags/changelog) of this site. 
- The site is [perpetually under renovation](/2019/08/perpetually-under-renovation/), as we all are.
- This site is powered by [a Python/Django stack on the backend](/2020/10/site-migration-to-django/).
    - Search is handled via a custom search backend using [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). 
    - Webmentions are handled via [webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) + [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) (incoming) and [webmention.app](https://webmention.app/) (outgoing).
    - content I post on Twitter, Reddit, and other services are fed back into this site via custom Python scripts.
- The source for all site content is [available on Github](https://github.com/roytang/blog). The source for my Python stack is unfortunately not publicly available, mostly because I think it's terrible.
- This site is hosted on [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/6c2e6b11b260) (affiliate link). 
- An off-site mirror/backup is generated every so often to [mirror.roytang.net](https://mirror.roytang.net/). (Hosted on Netlify.)
