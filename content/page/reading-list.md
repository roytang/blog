title: Reading List
---

This is a lifetime to-read list and also tracker of books I've read. The initial list came from [Reddit's Favorite Books](http://www.reddit.com/r/raerth/comments/cpxkq/reddits_favourite_books/) in 2010. In 2011, I added entries from [NPR's top 100 sci-fi/fantasy novels](http://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/1180501-npr-top-100-science-fiction-fantasy-novels). Every so often I'll add some books recommended to me to the list. The items are generally sorted in the order given above. I don't restrict myself to reading books only from this list. You can browse the [books tag](/tags/books) to see other things I've read.

Finished reading (parentheses indicates year read, and link to relevant content if any) (You can [jump to the unread list](#unread).)
