      "html": "Let me start by saying that I love playing the Fire Emblem series, but that I've almost never finished any campaigns.\nWhy? Because I'm not very patient. I love strategy games, but I hate taking my time. What does that have to do with this supposedly huge change? Well... let me tell you!\n\n---\n\nFirst, let's talk information. Some games make information discovery a game mechanic. In these games, obtaining new information is non-trivial and part of the excitement. Take [fog of war](https://www.spritesanddice.com/sites/default/files/Civilization%205%20Comparison.jpg), as seen in the Civilization series, as an example. Guess Who is another classic game about discovery.\n\nFire Emblem isn't a game about information discovery. In most situations, you have enough information to mentally simulate the outcome of any individual turn. In fact, Fire Emblem can be at its most frustrating when it mimics [the exact same fog of war mechanic](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/7/7a/FE5_Fog_of_War.png).\n\nDespite the information in Fire Emblem being freely available within the context of the game, however, it has never really been truly free. You were still required to spend your own time and energy digging for it, incorporating it into a mental simulation. To put it simply, macro battle strategy took a back seat to the micro turn-by-turn tactics.\n\n\nSo, *what's my point?* Well, Three Houses represents a big change in design focus. A monumental leap forward, in my opinion. Intelligent Systems is very consciously choosing to put the spotlight back on strategy. Why do I think that? **Intents.**\n\n---\n\nTake a look at two excellent, recent strategy games: Into The Breach and Slay The Spire. Both employ a mechanic I'm going to call Intents. Intents are forecasts of the enemy AI presented to the player transparently as possible. For Into The Breach, you know exactly [where the enemy is going and what they will do](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/intothebreach_gamepedia_en/d/d1/ITB_ss_1.png). For [Slay The Spire](https://roytang.net/uploads/2019/slaythespireintent.jpg), the information is still absolute, but it's not complete.\n\nIf you've been playing Three Houses, I think you know what I'm getting at. Take a look at these [intent lines](https://i.imgur.com/6LA3veq.jpg) and [automatic combat forecasts](https://i.imgur.com/aoRnxQk.jpg). You immediately know who intends to attack your unit and are given the tools to quickly gauge the level of danger that unit is now placed in. No menu navigation or mental simulation required. You can see from the two screenshots how I used that information to make a more fun and interesting move with my unit, since I was sure that it wasn't a suicide play.\n\n---\n\n**tl;dr:** Three Houses loosens up on the \"Take Your Time\" (or reset) mentality by choosing to directly provide information that you otherwise had to seek out. Uncertainty is now eliminated for you, automatically, allowing the game to focus more on overall battle strategy instead of unit micro.\nBookmark: <a title=\"reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/cii5wc/the_big_change_in_three_houses_ive_seen_nobody\" class=\"u-bookmark-of\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/cii5wc/the_big_change_in_three_houses_ive_seen_nobody/\">reddit.com/r/fireemblem/c...</a>\n<a class=\"u-mention\" href=\"https://roytang.net/uploads/2019/slaythespireintent.jpg/\"></a>\n<a href=\"https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/intothebreach_gamepedia_en/d/d1/ITB_ss_1.png\">https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/intothebreach_gamepedia_en/d/d1/ITB_ss_1.png</a>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/6LA3veq.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/6LA3veq.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/aoRnxQk.jpg\">https://i.imgur.com/aoRnxQk.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"https://roytang.net/uploads/2019/slaythespireintent.jpg\">https://roytang.net/uploads/2019/slaythespireintent.jpg</a>\n<a href=\"https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/7/7a/FE5_Fog_of_War.png\">https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fireemblem/images/7/7a/FE5_Fog_of_War.png</a>\n<a href=\"https://www.spritesanddice.com/sites/default/files/Civilization%205%20Comparison.jpg\">https://www.spritesanddice.com/sites/default/files/Civilization%205%20Comparison.jpg</a>",
