### DCI Number

#36918016. this is really only here for me to look at if I forget it, but you can also [look me up](https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/36918016) if you like.

#56883435. In January 2020, I managed to recover a second DCI number that I had only used for a few events in 2001. This has since been merged into the history of the above DCI number with the help of Wizards support.

** I wish I also had lifetime stats for Magic Online and Magic Arena, but I don't have any data sources for those

### Arena Limited stats

In March 2022, I made a "limited recap" post for Kamigawa Neon Dynasty, collating my Arena limited stats for that format. I think I'll keep doing it moving forward. I've also been back-tracking through the sets where I streamed my limited games so I can compile stats for them as well.
