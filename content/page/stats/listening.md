### Listening Stats

I don't actually listen to music too often, much less track what I'm listening to. There is some amount of data I have been able to track using [Last.fm](https://last.fm)'s scrobbling feature. Prior to 2010, my listening was tracked using a scrobbler plugin for Winamp. (Since this requires an internet connection, it does not include music I was listening to at work during this period). After I started using [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) in 2016, the data is now tracked using the Last.fm scrobbler app for spotify. There is no data from 2011-2015.

Note 1: Most likely the pre-2010 data includes my brothers playing Winamp on the same computer as me, because I don't even like Urbandub so there's no way I played that many of their tracks, but the data is what the data is, so here we are. My 2017 listening history also has a bunch of tracks from animated movies mostly because my niece kept listening to them when she visited.

Note 2: Data is extracted via [this service](https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/).

General stats:
