Probably the most useful ones:

| What | RSS | JSON | HFEED |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Everything | [RSS](/index.xml) | [JSON](/feed.json) | [HFEED](/hfeed.html) |
| Blog | [RSS](/blog/index.xml) |
| Notes | [RSS](/notes/index.xml) |
| Photos | [RSS](/photos/index.xml) |
| Links | [RSS](/links/index.xml) |

Generally, almost every list on the site has an RSS feed generated. For example: for tags, go to `/tags/<tagname>/index.xml`.

There might also be some secret feeds somewhere that I use for mysterious purposes, but then I can't go about announcing those can I now?
