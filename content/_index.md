## Hi, my name is Roy

It's 2020, and this is my personal website. Look around, maybe you'll find something that interests you. There's [the blog](/blog), a [microblog-like notes page](/notes), and maybe some more stuff lying around.

I'm a freelance senior software developer, solution architect, and technical consultant. If you have interesting work for me, you can check out [my resume](/resume).
