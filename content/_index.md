## Hi, my name is Roy

<a href="https://roytang.net">roytang.net</a> is a personal site, an [E/N site](http://sawv.org/en.html), and kind of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book). The site is [perpetually under renovation](/2019/08/perpetually-under-renovation/), as we all are.

I'm a freelance software developer, solution architect, and technical consultant, with over 15 years of experience. If you have interesting work for me, you can check out [my resume](/resume). 

I have a bunch of stuff here. Look around, maybe you'll find something that interests you. 

There's [the blog](/blog), where I write about things like [software development](/tags/software-development/), [Magic the Gathering](/tags/mtg/), [gaming](/tags/gaming), and [tech life](tags). I also write [weeknotes](/tags/weeknotes), which are more of personal updates, but also sometimes include links I find interesting. Here are some of my [favorite posts](/tags/favorites).

I also write about and maintain lists of media I consume: [books](/reviews/books), [movies](/reviews/movies), [tv](/reviews/tv), and [games](/reviews/games)

There's also a [notes page](/notes), which is more like shorter, day-to-day microblog entries. A lot of my other activities on platforms are also syndicated back here as notes.

There's a [links page](/links), where I share various links of interest.

There's a [photos page](/photos), which is just all the images and videos publicly available on the site (and via my social media stuff, etc). Liberally sprinkled with memes and gaming screenshots. I also do this daily sketching thing, which I collect in an [sketchbook album](/albums/sketchbook).

There's some other stuff around as well. I'm not yet sure how to organize everything, so I made an [explore page](/page/explore).

I am open to talking to strangers! Or friends even! Feel free to [contact me](/page/about/contact/).

Here's more [about me](/about). And more [about the site](/page/about/site/), if you like.
