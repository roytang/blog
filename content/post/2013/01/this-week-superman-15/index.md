Props:
<ul>
	<li>Kenneth Rocafort's art is as usual the highlight of the book for me. This time he gets to draw a full book of Superman in his <em>Action Comics</em> shirt and jeans, plus a few panels of the Justice League. Rocafort is easily the best artist DC comics has at the moment.</li>
	<li>Amazing build-up of Lex Luthor and how much of a genius/threat he is to Superman. It's terrific that faced with a threat beyond his grasp, Superman's first move is to consult his arch enemy before the Justice League. This book gives us a glimpse at how far Luthor has come since his days of being a mere military consultant back in <em>Action Comics</em>, and hopefully we're soon going to get an epic Lex Luthor arc in one of these books (or maybe in Snyder's upcoming new Superman book?)</li>
	<li>The Justice League! Nice to know that even Superman is smart enough to call for help, although this is apparently the first time he's done it. Also nice to know that he's managed to keep at least one secret from Batman!</li>
</ul>
Slops
<ul>
	<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Superman calling Diana "my beloved" in his head. Really? They've kissed a couple of times and gone out to dinner, I hope he doesn't already think they're soulmates or anything like that. Sheesh, that single panel of dialogue poured more cheese into the relationship than the last few issues of <em>Justice League</em></span></li>
