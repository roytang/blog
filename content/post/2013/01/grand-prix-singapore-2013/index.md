title: Grand Prix Singapore 2013
---

*(Archivist's note from 2023: While crawling through my socmed archives, I found that I attended a GP in Singapore in Jan 2013 but never wrote a blog post for it. This is a back-dated post to log what I can reconstruct of the events of that weekend.)*

#### Overview

Grand Prix Singapore 2013 was held from Jan 12-Jan 13 and the format was Return to Ravnica limited.

My schedule for this weekend trip was insane. I left Manila Friday evening and arrived just past midnight on Saturday and we headed to the GP in the morning. Crashed at a friend's place Saturday night. Then my flight back was from Monday just past midnight, so I had to be at the airport by Sunday evening. That meant I brought my bags with me on day two so I could head straight to the airport after. I would arrive home around 5am and I had to work on that Monday!

From an email before the trip:

> I feel strangely underprepared for this trip, it's like in my head it's just a normal weekend tournament. *Mahal lang ang commute lol*
> 

The event did not go well. From my personal notes:

> Went to Singapore to fight in the GP this weekend! Went 4-3-drop during the main event, and 4-3 during the Sunday super series sealed side event. Won 2 packs! Mike beat me by winning 4 packs during the weekend (but joining 3 events)
