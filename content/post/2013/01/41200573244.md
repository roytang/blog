title: So I finished reading A Memory of Light today (last Wheel of Time book)
---

<p>It&rsquo;s a satisfyingly good ending. The book is action-packed, with 80-90% of the book just bloody, bloody fighting, and very little of the whiny manipulative bitchiness that characterized some of the weaker books in the series. As far as I can tell most of the dangling points are wrapped up neatly, many characters get to be heroes and die, etc. Part of me wonders whether I&rsquo;d be this satisfied if Jordan had managed to finish everything himself.</p>
