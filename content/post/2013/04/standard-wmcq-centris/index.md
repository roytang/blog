title: Standard WMCQ @ Centris
---

Played a WMCQ at Neutral Grounds Eton Centris. Format was Standard. I was very unprepared, as I was only able to confirm I could play the day before. I put together a "weak junk reanimator" deck, I think it was something with Craterhoof Behemoth maybe? Probably similar to [this deck](https://mtgdecks.net/Standard/junk-reanimator-decklist-by-brad-nelson-47786) but issing some cards due to availability issues.

Well that was a wash. Dropped out of the wmcq at 2-3

<time>[16:59]</time> Not sure if im still cut out for long tourneys, headache after 5 rounds. Of course, having only 4 hours sleep was probably a factor

<time>[21:41]</time> Now I have the sniffles because it was so cold in the WMCQ venue earlier. Bah.

<time>[21:45]</time> I just used the word sniffles because i didnt want to say cold twice
