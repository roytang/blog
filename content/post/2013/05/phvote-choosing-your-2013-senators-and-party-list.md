**Resources**

The content of this post is regarding my own opinion and who I plan to vote for. If you want to do your own research (I highly recommend it), here are some links to get you started:

  * [<span style="line-height: 13px;">Movement for Good Governance briefers on Senatorial candidates</span>][1]
  * [Rappler Senatorial profiles][2]
  * I would also Google "rappler [candidate name] interview" for the interview article for each candidate (too many to list here)

Here's a [link to a Google doc of my own notes on each candidate][3], which I used as basis for recommendations below. (I didn't want to clutter up the blog post with details)

&nbsp;

**Recommendations**

A number of people have asked me to recommend who they should vote; while I prefer that they do their own research I don't mind giving suggestions. Here are my recommendations:

**Strongly recommended: **Jun Magsaysay, Risa Hontiveros, Teddy Casino

**It's okay to vote for: **Legarda, Escudero, Pimentel, Madrigal, Zubiri, Hagedorn, Poe

**It's okay to vote for the following if you don't mind them being members of or associated with political dynasties: **Cayetano, Gordon, Angara, Ejercito, Aquino

**It's okay to vote for the following if you don't mind their strong association with religious groups: **Delos Reyes, Villanueva

**Definitely DO NOT VOTE: **Honasan, Trillianes, Maceda, Mitos Magsaysay, Villar, Enrile, Binay, Cojuangco

For the "it's okay to vote for" groups, just use your own preferences, i.e. if you don't like Erap you probably won't vote for JV Ejercito.

&nbsp;

**My Ticket**

The following will most likely be the 12 I will vote on Monday (barring something ridiculous happening):

  1. <span style="line-height: 13px;">Jun Magsaysay (Team PNoy)</span>
  2. Risa Hontiveros (Team PNoy)
  3. Teddy Casino (Independent)
  4. Legarda (Team PNoy)
  5. Escudero (Team PNoy)
  6. Pimentel (Team PNoy)
  7. Madrigal (Team PNoy)
  8. Zubiri (UNA)
  9. Hagedorn (Independent)
 10. Gordon (UNA)
 11. Angara (Team PNoy)
 12. Aquino (Team PNoy)

I understand that the choices aren't perfect (I'm not too fond of some of them... ), but we have a limited selection of viable candidates and I'd rather fill up all 12 slots to at least have an infinitesimally small chance that the candidates I don't want don't get in.

&nbsp;

**What about the Party List?**<span style="line-height: 13px;"> There are really too many Party Lists to evaluate. Just don't vote for some ridiculous group; look for a group with a strong advocacy and track record. My personal preference is for <strong>#95 AGHAM Party List</strong>, because SCIENCE! Here's <a href="http://agham.org.ph/category/legislation/">a list of legislation they've supported</a> if you're interested.</span>

&nbsp;

That's the last post from me before the elections on Monday (I'll probably be ranting more [on Twitter][4]). If you have a chance to vote go out and do so, but be sure to do so wisely; it's your privilege and an expression of what you want for this country. Let's hope that the surveys are wrong and the voting public miraculously smartens up.

&nbsp;

Edit: The original recommendations list missed out Grace Poe. Also added a short note on imperfect choices.

Thanks for the summary, Roy. This makes things a lot easier. So, when are you running for public office? #SRJTfor2016
