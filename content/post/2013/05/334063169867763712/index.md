title: Elections 2013 Aftermath
---

Welcome to the new world. It looks a lot like the old one, I still have to go to work today.

<time>[05:56]</time> I'm looking at the partial results and 4 of the top 12 are in my "Do not vote" list =/ Hopefully the lower half can still change.

<time>[05:56]</time> In 2010 only 2 people I voted for made the Senate; today 6 of my 12 are in the partials maybe because I went with a full slate this time.

<time>[06:02]</time> Compare to the 2010 senatorial election results, more neophytes this time around: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_senators_elected_in_the_Philippine_Senate_election,_2010

<time>[Wed, May 15, 2013, 5:52 a.m.]</time> Poe, Legarda, Escudero, Pimentel, Trillianes, Honasan, Zubiri, Jun Magsaysay, Hontiveros, Hagedorn, Villanueva, Madrigal - the top 12 if members of political dynasties were banned
