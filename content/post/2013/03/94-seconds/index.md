94 Seconds was a mobile game we played for a little bit in March 2013. 

94 seconds is a trivia-like game-app. You have to give an item that fits a category and starts with a given letter. Answers are invalid, common, or rare. Rarer answers get more points. Once you answer, you're given a new cat and new letter. You answer as many as you can in 94 seconds.
