  "text": "Spoilers:  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  V    I like it primarily because the fight scenes have that grand scale I want out of Superman fight scenes.     I'm willing to forgive his being unable to move the fights out of populated zones, as the enemies are at the same scale of strength and as much as Superman wants to prevent loss of life, Zodd&co would rather do as much damage as they can. Even if he wanted to move the fight to a different location, they can move it right back. It's not like he can run to draw them away when they know they can just smash up the city to get him to show up again  =P    I liked that Louis isn't an idiot and quickly found out his identity.     I disliked the ending where now everybody else including the US military are idiots and either can't recognize him or can't use facial recognition software to figure out the disguise of those eyeglasses.     And yeah, surely all of Smallville knows it's him! His dad's death was done in a pointless way.",
