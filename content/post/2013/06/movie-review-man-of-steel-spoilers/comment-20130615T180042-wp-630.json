  "text": "(spoiler) when kal was forced to kill zod, i think it made sense for him to hate to have to do it. even if so many people died because of their fight (though i doubt millions), it would still be psychologically different when you do it up close. also, zod wanted a home only for kryptonians, jor el wanted both races to co-exist, and kal killing zod is almost like committing genocide (1 left, so almost), and to his own people to boot. he must have hated having to kill his last fellow kryptonian after just learning where he came from. i guess it could be better if after stopping zod's plan and meeting with lois, he could have expressed sadness looking at all the rubble around. that might have made it more consistent. still, i think that part is fine.",
