XBox One debuting at $500, a terrible price point. PS4 coming in at $400 or less would blow them away

<time>[04:04]</time> I could get another couple hours of sleep...or I could just stay up and watch more e3 stuff

<time>[04:07]</time> Went ahead and preordered Duels 2014 on Steam. duh, it's not like I'm going to skip it.

<time>[04:10]</time> So apparently Plants vs Zombies is a third person shooter now #E3

<time>[04:15]</time> Bah, the stream quality is terrible #E3

<time>[04:26]</time> Looks like Morrigan's back in Dragon Age: Inquisition. Won't be out til late 2014 though. #E3

<time>[05:21]</time> Sleepiness starting to catch up. Time for a short jog

<time id="344289060531085315">[11:04]</time> Sony just won E3 over Microsoft, hands down

<time id="10152280828908912">[20:23]</time> No way to verify if what he's saying is true, but damn Sony completely blew Microsoft away, all guns blazing. I wasn't even considering getting a PS4 at launch at all, but now I'm a bit tempted. (Realistically it's still going to be expensive/hard to find over on our side :p)
