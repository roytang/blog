It's the end of the year, so it feels like a good time to look back at the books and games I've gone through in 2013.

I guess it's my lack of focus really but my reading rate has really gone down over the past few years, I guess in favor of TV, comics and games. (I guess comics count as reading too, but I'm talking about full-length novels.

For 2013 as far as I can tell I only finished reading the following novels:

  * Slaughterhouse Five (Kurt Vonnegut)
  * Foundation Trilogy (Isaac Asimov) -- I only read up to Second Foundation, I'll get around to the later books sometime I guess
  * A Memory of Light (Sanderson/Jordan) -- been reading the Wheel of Time for years and I'm glad Sanderson was able to bring it to a decent end
  * Shadows in Flight (Orson Scott Card)

I suppose I should make it a new years resolution to read more books. I have a reading list that I have [stored on Dropbox][1]Â that I'm trying to work through. I think getting more paper books helps -- most of my reading the past few years has been mostly e-books but having at least one paper book around that I can pick up without worrying about a charger or something is also good. I'm around halfway through a copy of Dune I picked up at a used bookstore.

As for games, this is the hobby that takes up most of my free time, however my backlog is horrendously large. Inspired by a [NeoGAF thread][2], I've started tracking purchases and finishes/completes.

Here are the game purchases I made in 2013:

  * Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm (PC retail)
  * <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">FTL (humble bundle)</span>
  * Humble Weekly Sale: Telltale Games (8 games)
  * Humble Bundle 8 (9 games)
  * WB Humble Bundle (9 games)
  * Borderlands 2 + season pass + mech/psycho dlc (GMG + Steam)
  * Civilization 5: Brave New World (GMG)
  * Morrowind GOTY (Steam)
  * Oblivion GOTY (Steam)
  * Legend of Grimrock (steam)
  * Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 (steam)
  * Tales of Graces F (PS3 retail)
  * Injustice (PS3 retail)
  * The Last of Us (PS3 retail)
  * Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix (PS3 retail)
  * Final Fantasy 13-2 (PS3 retail)
  * Tales of Xillia (PS3 retail)
  * Capcom vs SNK 2 (PS3 via PSN)
  * Ni no Kuni (PS3 via PSN)
  * Speklunky (Vita via PSN)
  * Guacamelee (PS3/Vita via PSN)
  * Marvel vs Capcom 2 (PS3 via PSN)
  * Shin Megami Tensei 4 (3ds retail)
  * The Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds (3ds retail)
  * Persona 4 Golden (Vita retail)
  * Disgaea 3 (Vita retail)
  * Street Fighter x Tekken (Vita retail)
  * FF9 (PSN)
  * Persona 3 Portable (PSN)

And the games I finished in 2013:

  * Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm campaign
  * Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014
  * Borderlands 2
  * Injustice story mode
  * Mass Effect 3
  * The Last of Us
  * Tales of Graces F
  * Tales of Xillia (Milla side only)
  * The Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds
  * Persona 4 Golden
  * Disgaea 3 main story
  * Civ5 BNW (I'm going to go ahead and count this since I'm sure I got more than a full game's worth of it already)

So the count is at -41 or such. It's pretty bad, but also around what I expected lol. I'm fairly close to finishing a number of those games (I'm at the SMT4 final dungeon and the last chapter of FF 13-2 right now). A lot of the backlog is due to me randomly picking up Humble Bundles which increase the count significantly. Hopefully I'll be able to have a much smaller backlog in 2014 -- but there are already a number of release I'm looking forward to, not to mention the possibility of picking up a PS4 early next year.
