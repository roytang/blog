title: Movies I Watched In 2013
---

#### Iron Man (2008)

<time>[2013-04-25 21:42] </time> Now watching: Iron Man (2008)

#### Iron Man 3 (2013)

<time>[2013-04-29 22:23] </time> Iron man 3 (@ SM City North EDSA w/ 12 others) http://4sq.com/18dMuKv

#IronMan3 It was ok. Not as great as some people have said, but probably better than 2. [@alvinjtang](https://twitter.com/alvinjtang/) says it'll look worse in a few years.

Some people I know (big comic fans) were disappointed at the Mandarin build-up then the let-down reveal. I dunno, I was kinda fine with the deception.

I felt like the second half of the movie was way too predictable.

Did Tony Stark just utter a bunch of gibberish to get Happy Endings Max to climb to the top of the van and tweak a screw on a satellite dish?

Apparently it's all right for Pepper to wear the armors (one of them at least, and a hand or two), but Tony can't spare one for Rhodes because "they're all coded for me"

How did two Mark 42 parts make it out of the garage while the rest had to bang against the door to get a kid's attention?

I watched this movie more than a week ago, so those are all I could remember right now. I thought it was okay, but not "best in the trilogy okay".

#### El Presidente (2012)

<time>[2013-05-19 16:43] </time> Now showing on this bus: El Presidente. Idk how historically accurate this movie is

#### The Wolverine (2013)

<time>[2013-07-27 17:10] </time> The Wolverine was :okay: (@ Ristorante Bigoli - @bigoli_official w/ 7 others) http://4sq.com/1bY9CCV

<time>[22:59]</time> In The Wolverine, Logan is really, really bad at planning. But we already knew that from the first 3 X-Men movies.

#### The Princess Bride (1987)

<time>[2013-08-24 02:01] </time> Now watching (for the first time): the princess bride

#### GI Joe: Retaliation (2013)

<time>[2013-08-31 06:51] </time> Watching GI Joe Retaliation. This movie's plot is ridiculous

They wanted to be faithful to the 80s cartoon, so they let Cobra Commander escape in the end.

#### Star Trek: Into Darkness (2013)

<time>[2013-09-28 20:41] </time> Just watched Star Trek: Into Darkness. Movie was okay, made better by the fact that I had just seen Wrath of Khan the other day

#### Thor: The Dark World (2013)

<time>[2013-11-01 15:26] </time> Thor2 was okay, I like it more than Iron Man 3, mostly because I like the Star Wars x High Fantasy style---
