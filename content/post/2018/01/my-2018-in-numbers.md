title: My 2018 in review
type: post

Happy new year! Last year I [posted some year-end statistics](/2018/01/my-2017-in-numbers/). That seems like a good way to recap the year, so let's do it again. Random statistics from 2018:

Work, Learning and Self Improvement:

  * Hours worked: 1,163 (up around 50% from last year)
  * Programming languages/frameworks learned: I'll say 5. I'm counting: (a) C++ which I revisited this year after more than a decade of not using it; (b) Go, which I used for the templating in the Hugo blog; (c) Flask, which I had dabbled in before but only used in a full-scale project this year; (d) Laravel, which I also used in a couple of projects this year. 
  * Books read: 4. Sad. Down 5 from last year. Must finish more books in 2019.
  * Duolingo streak: 92 days (Hooray!)

Writing and Social media:

  * Facebook status updates: 1093, down from 1463 last year, that's a good sign I think. Last year I measured my FB activity using the "facebook report" on Wolfram Alpha, but this seems to no longer work, probably due to the recent FB API changes. This time I instead downloaded an archive of my FB activity and counted the "status_updates" from your_posts.json using a python script.
  * Instagram posts: 21 (Down 100 from last year. I'm not sure if I'll continue using it too much...)
  * Tweets: 1566 (up from 1484 last year)
  * Answers written on Quora: 3. Down by 14. I may be [winding down my Quora participation anyway](/2018/12/quora/).
  * 104 blog posts (including this one; total of 818 up 59 from last year)
  * 0 words written for [Nanowrimo][2] (hopefully I can have another go next year)
  * 0 sketches submitted to [r/sketchdaily][3] (I might try to pick this up again this year)

Gaming:

  * Games purchased (not including any I got for free for some reason): 37, not including DLC, most of it from my three-month experiment with Humble Montly. This is a huge improvement from last year's 67. In fact, my gaming spend for 2018 was 1/3 what it was in 2017, so huge props to me lol. Breakdown: 4 steam, 34 humble, 3 dlc)
  * Games "finished" (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete): 10, up 2 from 2017! The list: [Twilight Princess HD](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/974999316036136960) (WiiU), [Eternal](/2018/11/review-eternal-or-eternal-primer-for-mtg-players/), [Skyrim](/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/), [Ni No Kuni (PS3)](/2018/10/late-game-review-ni-no-kuni-wrath-of-the-white-witch-2013/), [Spider-man (PS4)](/11/game-review-marvels-spider-man-for-ps4/), Invisible Inc, Orwell, Tomb Raider, [Life is Strange](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/949318192073121792), Papers Please (not yet achievement complete, but close), Final Fantasy XII: Zodiac Age (I had this on last year's list as 95% done, I decided to finish it a few hours before 2019 lol). Down 1 from last year, not too bad. I also haven't bothered finishing my FFXII run from last year lol
  * Best Eternal Rank: Ranked Master (363), Draft Master
  * Best MTGA Rank: Gold 4
  * Average points per turn in Words with Friends: 26 (down from 27)
  * MTG GPs attended: 0, but I did [do an RTPQ in KL](/2018/06/kuala-lumpur-and-the-mtg25a-rptq/) this year. Most likely 0 again for 2019.

Others:

  * Fitbit activity: 1,820,053 steps, 1,419.64 km walked
  * Donuts eaten: 4 (down from 12 last year!)
  * Other countries visited: 0, as predicted. Likely 0 in 2019 as well.
  * Baptisms attended: 1 (same as last year)
  * Weddings attended: 0 (down 1)
  * Wakes attended: 0 (thankfully)
  * Things watched on Netflix: 789 (Up 69 from last year)
  * Quiz nights attended: 8 (we won once) - down from 3/19 in 2017
  * Uber trips: 18 (down from 64 in 2017, RIP uber)
  * Grab trips: 101 (!)
  * Times I won the lotto: 0 (I kind of regret putting this number two years ago, as now I can't remove it without looking suspicious)
  * Bears defeated in single combat: 0

Overall, the year was a lot busier than 2017, since I took on a lot more work, especially in the middle half of the year. I'm looking to lighten the load a bit in 2019, we'll see.
