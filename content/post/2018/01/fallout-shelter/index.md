Fallout Shelter was a fun little management/simulation game I played for a couple of months in Dec 2017 / Jan 2018. Steam says I almost had 35 hours of playtime.

<time>[2017-12-14 03:36] </time> Crap. I forgot to tell my Fallout Shelter explorer to return to the vault before going on vacation. Sheâ€™s gonna die...

<time>[2018-01-27 05:36] </time> I'm not sure I want to bother grinding out these last three Fallout Shelter achievements
