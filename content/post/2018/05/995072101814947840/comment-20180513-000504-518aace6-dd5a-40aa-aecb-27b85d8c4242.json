I get a fair judge, which is better for me, my practice, and my clients, and for me, the justice system in general, and I could just call this entire episode karma- a &quot;you reap what you sow&quot; kind of thing- and call it a day, OR I could throw my hat in this mess, do everything I can to insist on &quot;impeachment only&quot; for her so that she- somebody I dislike- gets to keep her job and gets to continue treating us litigators for controversial clients unfairly.    Maybe I&#x27;m a lesser person for for being this way, but I think you understand the choice I made.    Oh, and her removal via quo warranto has legal merit, even J. Velasco who dissented on her removal, said that quo warranto is the proper remedy.  And J. Carpio, who also dissented, voted &quot;yes&quot; on the question of whether or not she violated the Constitution, unanimously with all the other justices who voted on that issue.      It only seems &quot;unfair&quot; because this is the first time a justice has been removed via quo warranto.  There was no precedent to speak of.  Thus, it was the duty of the Court to set a precedent using their own interpretations  of the laws and facts, and admittedly, she is not well-liked by the Court, so if a precedent such as this was desired, this was the Court to do it.",
