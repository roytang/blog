Not all points raised were damning; some were even favorable.    J. Del Castillo, in the quo warranto case, voted in Sereno&#x27;s favor despite having given testimony about her in Congress.    The issue in the quo warranto case only relates to the SALN, which is not the topic of most of the testimonies given in Congress.  Remember, the reason these Justices were asked to give testimony in Congress is for impeachment, which is a different proceeding from quo warranto.  Quo warranto questions the qualifications for the office; impeachment questions acts done while in office. So the testimonies given in Congress is largely about what was done when Sereno was already CJ, not whether or not she submitted the requirements in her application for CJ.    Sereno never disputed, even admitted, that she did not submit some SALNs in her application for the CJ post.  Her defense was that the vetting body- the JBC- accepted it as substantial compliance.     Joy Reyes-Madamba",
