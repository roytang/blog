I've been meaning to add SSL to this blog ever since I first heard of [Let's Encrypt][2] last year. Unfortunately, support on my otherwise awesome webhost was not yet first-class and seemed complicated at the time, so I kept putting it off. But recently I was testing something unrelated and found out that I [needed to have SSL on my server in order for OAuth2 to work][3], so I grudgingly got to it.

Luckily I found out about a handy utility written in Ruby that does most of the stuff for me: [letsencrypt-webfaction][4]. It was surprisingly easy to setup, with only a [single false start because I had a silly typo][5].

So now this site has SSL! Hooray!
