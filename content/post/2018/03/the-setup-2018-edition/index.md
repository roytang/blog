While browsing through my old blog posts, I found one about [my setup from 2010][1]. I figured it was a good time to do an update. I like doing posts like these because it provides an easy reference for me to look back and see what I was working with at a certain point in time.

### What Hardware Do I Use?

**Desktop.** I bought a new desktop rig back in late 2015, here are the specs:

Case: Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B
  
Fan: 120mm internal aux fan
  
PSU: Cooler Master B600 V2 600W
  
CPU: Intel Core i5-4460
  
MB: ASUS H97ME
  
RAM: 2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600
  
Graphics: Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb
  
SSD: Samsung 850Evo 250gb
  
HDD: Seagate 2tb
  
OS: Windows 8.1 OEM which I immediately upgraded to Windows 10 (upgrade was free at that time)

This cost significantly more than any desktop I had assembled before, but it's worth it. Still going strong up to now. Can easily handle most programming tasks I throw at it, including the notoriously resource-hungry Android development process and of course Google Chrome. Pretty good for gaming as well, although I'm not really the "4k 120fps" kind of gamer.

I have two old monitors (a 19&#8243; and a 21&#8243;) hooked up to this desktop (haven't bothered buying a new monitor...  it's on my list).

Late last year I also impulse-bought a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2016, I'm mostly happy with it (it's my first "real" mechanical keyboard") Recently one of the keys has been acting up, being a bit unresponsive but it got better after I removed the keycaps and cleaned up a bit under there.

As you can see above, I also have a much wider desk now than the dinky old computer table in the old post.

**Laptop.** My only laptop currently is a work-issued Acer Aspire ES1-433-38DR. It's nice and handy and workable, but it's not even a year old and I've already had some issues with the laptop suddenly dying when it's not plugged in. For this reason (and a few other reasons like being able to publish iOS apps), I've been considering getting a Macbook Pro. (The only thing holding me back is the ridiculous price!)

**Gaming consoles.** Gaming is one of my indulgences, so there's a few:

  * I still have a PS3, but it's no longer the original model from the old post. We had to buy a new one after some time because the original conked out. The PS3 is rarely used nowadays however. I still keep it around because I actually still have some backlog that I like to fantasize about finishing one day. \*Shakes fist at Ni No Kuni\*
  * I also have a WiiU that I purchased around 2012 or 2013 I think. My WiiU library isn't huge, but it let me play 3 different Zelda games! I often think about getting a Switch, but I want to finish what remains of my WiiU library first. (Only Twilight Princess and Earthbound remain AFAIK)
  * I have a PS4, purchased in October 2014. My PS4 library is larger than my WiiU one, but these days I typically only play one game on either console at a time.
  * I also bought a [Steam Link][2] to stream gaming from my desktop. I use my Logitech F710 wireless controller with it. It's great when I have platformers on Steam that I want to play.
  * Handhelds: I have both a [PS Vita and a 3DS][3]. Okay, actually I have two 3DSes, the other one is a 3DSXL. I rarely do handheld gaming anymore though, unless there's a long ride or something. I do still tend to carry one of these whenever I go out with a bag. Just in case.

**TV.** Mid 2017 one of our 32-inch Samsung TVs in the house conked out with a bad display so we decided to buy a new one. We decided on a [43&#8243; LG Smart TV][4]. Super happy with this, the display is much better than the previous TV. IDK how it works, I think they have some sort of software optimization that makes things look better. It's great for Netflix, Youtube, Gaming, etc.

**Tablet.** I have an 9.7&#8243; iPad Pro that I bought late 2016. I also bought an Apple Pencil for it, my main intention was to have a tool for sketching. Pretty happy with it, even though it looks pretty battle-scarred by now as I'm not the most careful user.

**Cellphone.** Wow, I was still using the Nokia 5800 in that last post. I've gone through quite a few Android smartphones since then, mostly Samsung Galaxy models, with the most recent one being a secondhand S5. I always have problems with battery life (probably due to being on data all the time) so last December I decided to buy myself an ASUS Zenfone Max 4. It's not as high-spec as the Samsung Galaxy line, but this has 10000mAH battery which means I can go all day without having to scrounge around for a charger. I haven't used my Powerbank in a while!

**Others.** I have a 10,0050mAH Asus Zenpower powerbank that was way more useful before I got the Zenfone. (I just now realized they're related brands). I also have a Fitbit Charge 2 for some reason. I find it more useful for tracking my walking than the mobile apps I used to use.

### What Software Do I Use?

**OS.** Windows 10 is mostly serviceable. I'd love to have a Linux setup as well, but it's difficult to justify that as a primary OS when Windows has games! Instead I have a Linux Mint VM that I run on my desktop when I need to do Linux-y stuff.

**Text Editor.** These days any programming I do usually involves some combination of Python, JavaScript/Node or PHP, so the text editor is my weapon of choice. I tried [Atom][5] for a while, but it was a tad too slow for my tastes. I also tried [Sublime Text][6], which is great and has everything I need but for some reason keeps nagging me to pay for it. Recently I installed [VS Code][7], which has been pretty good so far so for now it's my main editor.

**Other Programming Stuff.** For times that I need to dig into any Java stuff, I also still have an installation of [Eclipse Mars][8] on my machine. (I don't miss Eclipse). I also have Unity3d installed on my desktop, as I still like to pretend I have time to work on one of my gamedev projects. For SSH, I used to use Putty, but lately I discovered the great ["Bash on Ubuntu on Windows"][9]. The name is a handful, but it makes doing Linux shell stuff like SSH and curl and whatever a lot easier.

**Web Browser.** Most of my work is web-related and I often use cloud resources, so the web browser is important. I recently switched from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox as my main browser, since the latest Firefox promised a bunch of speed improvements. TBH, I can't quite tell the difference.

**Office Suite.** As mentioned above, I often use cloud resources, so it's mostly GMail, Google Calendar, Google Drive and Google Docs/Sheets for my needs. I also have a local installation of [LibreOffice][10] because sometimes I have to open Excel files that are hundreds of megabytes large and Google Sheets refuses to import it. For cloud storage, my preference is Dropbox.

**Note-taking.** I've grown fond of [Google Keep][11]. It's lightweight and handy enough for my usage, and the Android widget means I can use it to capture random thoughts and ideas throughout the day. On the iPad I also use NotesPlus if I happend to be in a meeting where I feel like writing notes down with the Apple Pencil.

**Communications.** Usually some combination of Slack + Skype for work-related stuff, although some clients prefer WeChat or WhatsApp so I have those too. For personal comms, it's mostly Viber and FB Messenger and sometimes Discord.

**Sketching.** On my iPad I use and am a big fan of the Procreate app for digital sketches, which I think I even paid for a while back.

**Odds and Ends**. I have a bunch of other software utilities I often recommend. I use [VLC Media Player][12] for watching stuff on my desktop (doesn't everybody?). I use [Space Sniffer][13] to check disk usage. [Audacity][14] for the rare instance that I have to do some kind of audio editing.
