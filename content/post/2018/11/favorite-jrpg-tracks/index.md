I used to play a lot of JRPGs, especially back during they heyday of the Playstation Era. These days, I only get to play a few, but I still enjoy a lot of the music tracks from this game, often the battle music since I prefer more upbeat tracks. Here are some of my favorite JRPG tracks from recent years:

Rivers in the Desert (Persona 5) -- easily the best song in the OST for me, and the rest of this OST is amazing so that's saying a lot.<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

Reach Out to the Truth (Persona 4) -- P4G was the first Persona game I played, and I found the battle music had dug a permanent place into my brain. I sometimes find myself humming this to myself randomly often when I'm out walking.<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

Crazy Chocobo (Final Fantasy XIII-2) -- this is kind of a left-field choice, but this ridiculously metal version of the traditional Chocobo theme leapt out at me the first time I encountered it in-game. I liked it so much that I now use it as my regular alarm tone. It's really hard to sleep through!<figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio">

I'm sure there's a lot of other great JRPG tracks I'm missing out on. After starting this post, I collected the above tracks into [a Youtube playlist][1]. Maybe I'll expand it later on when I encounter other tracks, feel free to recommend some to me!
