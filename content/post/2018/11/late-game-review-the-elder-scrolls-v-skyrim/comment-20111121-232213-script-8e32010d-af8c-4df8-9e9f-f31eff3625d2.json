Trouble is i've already cleared this dungeon and have the book in my inventory, but i dont get the option to turn it in, and the quest marker still points to the empty chest in the crypt that i got it from. I tried putting it back in the chest (so i could pick it up again) but apparently i cant because its a quest item. Anything i can do about this?</p>",
