I ask Aela how the kids are doing and she asks\n what I was thinking bringing us out into the wilds where there are \nwolves and bears and whatnot. Ignoring her, I talk to the child and \noffer a game of tag. The child immediately runs outside and I chase \nafter her to find her being attacked by wolves. I hurriedly draw my \nsword, Aela would never let me live this down\n\n<br/></p>",
