  "text": "The Kill Yourself quest is doable the dying way without, y'know, death.     It triggers success when you pass a certain point on the death jump. Simply hit escape after you reach this point (but before you SPLAT!) and quit the game. Reloading causes you to appear in your last saved New-U location with no one the wiser.    Jack will still call you out on it as if you had died though. It's a long drop, and he starts talking the moment you leap and it reaches the point of no return.",
