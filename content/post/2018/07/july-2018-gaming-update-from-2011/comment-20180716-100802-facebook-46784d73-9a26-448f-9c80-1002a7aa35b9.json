  "text": "I actually never finished Borderlands 2. I dunno, I just never liked the gameplay enough, and I tried and played a lot of hours with all the classes except for one of the dlc guys.     Currently playing Warhammer Inquisitor because it's been a while since I've played a Diablo style aarpg. It's got some buggy skills and has inadequate documentation, but it's kinda fun, and it seems like it's getting patched at a decent rate.     Also still playing NBA 2k18 and Battletech.    Skyrim, I mess around with now and then. I miss the customizable spells of earlier Elder Scrolls games. I really wish Elder Scrolls would put customizable spells and customizable skills into the next game (surely not going to happen). Like you get a bunch of slots you can use to modify a spell or melee or stealth skill.    Two Worlds 2, a blatant Elder Scrolls copy, did one thing amazingly better--the custom spells. It was possible to make a spell that shoots a spread of projectiles, which then bounce around and hit multiple targets, applying a dot to each target... and then summoning a skeleton at each detonation. Too bad they didn't do that for other skills. They could have had customization that lets you add aoe damage to a sword skill that then stealths you after, for example.",
