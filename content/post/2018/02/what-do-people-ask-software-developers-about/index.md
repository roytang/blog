title: What do people ask software developers about?

I'm not sure non-technical people really understand what it is software developers do for a living, or that there are different kinds of software developers that do different kinds of things. I'm not even sure my parents understand the kind of work I do, even though all four of their children are in the same industry.

I think non-technical people generally just put you into a "technical person" bucket and assume you can do all sorts of technical wizardry. (I am not saying this is untrue!) The usual stereotype is relatives and friends asking you to fix their printer or their wifi, but I've gotten a few different kinds of requests over the years:

  * A high school friend who I haven't contacted in years messages me out of the blue because she wasn't receiving emails from her friends anymore. (It turns out she had somehow managed to block everything coming in from Gmail and Yahoo domains)
  * A different high school friend who I also haven't been in touch with also messages me to ask about an error on his laptop (I had no idea how to help him!)
  * Another high school friend asks me for advice on how to resolve a problem he has with permissions on his Windows 10 OS
  * A relative messages me with "You're a graphic designer right?" (I'm not, and IDK why I would give that impression). Follow-up: "Which one of your siblings is the graphic designer?" (None of us are!)
  * An acquaintance once asked me "You can hack someone's Facebook right?" (Not saying I can't, but I probably won't!)
  * Another acquaintance asked me if I could help him access a password protected Excel file. (Okay, I might be able to do this one, but it depends and it might take some time)
  * Recently there has also been an uptick in people asking me about Bitcoin (I know how it works, but please don't ask me in detail about the mining!)
  * Even technical people ask me stuff outside of my usual scope all the time. A client I help maintain the webapp for sometimes randomly asks me about networking issues on their internal network (I have no idea how that is set up! But I try to help anyway)

I actually don't mind people randomly asking me technical questions. Or any kind of questions or advice really. I'll always try my best to answer and help if I can. I'm just slightly amused at what people imagine I'm able to do.

Slightly related: I recently opened up my DMs on Twitter, so you can also ask me questions there!
