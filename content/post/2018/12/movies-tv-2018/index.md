title: Movies/TV I watched in 2018
toc: true

This is an archive of movies/TV I watched in 2018 that haven't otherwise had blog posts, cobbled together from social media posts.

### Movies

#### Black Panther (2018)

<time>[2018-02-16 21:09] </time> BLACK PANTHER spoiler-free review!

- it's a fun, action-filled romp and Wakanda is amazing
- tchalla was ok, killmonger and nakia were great, shuri was badass
- some of the actions scenes didnt seem too well-shot/edited, making them hard to follow
- I realize I'm saying this about a universe where there are talking raccoons and magic hammers, but some of the Wakandan tech push the boundaries of my suspension of disbelief
- my expectations were probably set a bit too high what with some people saying it's the best MCU movie since Iron Man or calling it revolutionary or eye-opening
- off the top of my head I'd say I consider Civil War, Spider-Man Homecoming and Thor Ragnarok better than this one
- I understand that it's revolutionary in the sense that it's a major hollowood motion picture filled with a cast of mostly african descent and that some of the characters are motivated by real world racial issues. But the plot itself was typical for an MCU first movie (maybe I've seen too many MCU movies? lol). I dont think it presents the issues it covers under any new or revolutionary context. I guess I kind of went in hoping to be impressed on the level of The Dark Knight or such, but I was disappointed in that regard. It's a very straightforward movie
- I didn't watch in Imax, which I kind of regret, as I can imagine some of the scenes being pretty good
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly, pero baka mahirapan sya intindihin accent ni Chadwick Boseman
- There's a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene

#### Annihilation (2018)

<time>[2018-03-15 00:53] </time> I just finished watching Annihilation. I have no idea what happened in this movie

#### Baby Driver (2017)

<time>[2018-05-03 00:41] </time> I watched Baby Driver. Great movie. Might have been a bit better if I knew sign language. Kind of makes me want to visit that parallel universe where Edgar Wright got to finish Ant-Man. No post-credit scenes.

#### Snowpiercer (2013)

<time>[2018-05-05 23:12] </time> I also watched Snowpiercer. I had this on my backlog for a while and decided to watch because it came up in quiz night. Good movie, kinda weird. My copy didnt have Korean subs, so I had to guess a lot of what that one guy was saying.

#### Dunkirk (2017)

<time>[2018-05-05 21:29] </time> Lazy Saturday. Watched Dunkirk. Movie was good but also kind of meh

---

#### The Post (2017)

<time>[2018-05-10 23:57] </time> I watched The Post. Started out a bit boring, but it was a great movie. A stark reminder of why we need the media to hold the powerful to account, certainly relevant to modern times.

---

#### Deadpool 2 (2018)

<time>[2018-05-18 23:51] </time> Deadpool 2 SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:

- entertaining enough; kind of a popcorn movie. i kinda liked the first movie better
- if you watched the first movie, you kinda know what to expect in terms of tone and humor and all
- dont bring your kids. but if it matters to you, there is significantly less sex in this movie than the first one
- the plot did go in ways i was not expecting
- i did not watch in imax, it seemed fine
- there is a mid credits scene. well, scenes. like five of them strung together
- there is no end credits scene but there is a... small bonus near the end if you pay attention
- would i recommend na panoorin ni mama: definitely not

---

#### Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018)

<time>[2018-07-04 23:23] </time> Ant-Man and the Wasp Spoiler Free Review!

- this movie is great; it's fun and and action-packed and there's even more Luis than you thought you wanted; go watch it
- it's like the first movie, except better and more fun
- best new character: FBI Agent Jimmy Woo played by Randall Park (sorry Michelle Pfeifer)
- there are two mid/post-credit scenes. One of them is better than the other
- I watched in Imax. Some scenes were nice, but it's probably more of a nice-to-have
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Pwede, but kelangan ng kasama to explain things. Baka ok lang pag tagalized na sa tv

#### Venom (2018)

<time>[2018-10-13 19:56] </time> VENOM spoiler-free review:

- I wasn't sure if I would watch this, given the poor critical response, but it's an ok movie overall, fun to watch but nothing to write home about (though I wouldnt spend extra for Imax). I would say comparable with Thor: Dark World or Iron Man 2
- the first 15 mins or so felt draggy, but after that things happen quickly
- overall plot slightly predictable, and not too long, very straightforward
- a tiny bit of humor thrown in, not enough to make it feel like an MCU movie
- not sure if there's something with the sound editing or some of the actors weren't delivering their lines properly, but I had trouble with understanding the lines in some scenes
- the Venom symbiote seems to have some extra powers here (as compared to the comics)
- Tom Hardy does a good job here, I feel like he was having fun during this movie
- There is a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene
- Would Mama like it? Hard no.

---

#### Aquaman (2018)

<time>[2018-12-12 21:43] </time> Aquaman Spoiler-Free review!

- I came in with low expectations (given DC's history), but the movie turned out pretty good, even though it wasn't the best comic book related thing I've seen this week (see previous post)
- it's fun and action-packed, some fun set pieces and action sequences. Lots of CGI (as can be expected)
- the plot is fairly predictable, I've seen similar story arcs for this character more than once, things pretty much happen as you expect
- also the plot kinda feels a bit like black panther, except in reverse? does that make sense?
- the first act felt a bit longish, but not really draggy or anything, it's just that there's a lot of set up to be done
- the director's horror movie background shines through a bit in one of the sequences around the second act
- I had the urge to pee about 1 hour in, but I had to hold it in until the end of the movie, I didn't want to miss stuff. So much water didn't help!
- Arthur's dad looks like a Pinoy lol
- I didn't watch in IMAX3D, but I suspect there's a lot of 3d given the volume of CGI
- there is one mid-credits scene
- I'd say it's family-friendly even though there is quite a bit of bloodshed
- magugustuhan ba ni Mama. Eh, maybe? Not really her type of movie, but maybe if I explain it a bit?

#### Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse (2018)

<time>[2018-12-17 00:36] </time> <p>
Into the Spider-Verse spoiler-free review

- this is a great animated comic book movie, it makes me happy
- I may have been a bit overhyped by the early reviews, but it was very entertaining, funny and had brilliant presentation, melding the medium of movies with comic books in a way that has never been seen before
- again, the presentation is fantastic, the animation is great and intentional and the funky alternate universe stuff is represented well
- IDK if I would call it the best comic book movie of all time, or even the best Spider-Man movie of all time, but definitely one of the best animated movies of all time, for a comic book fan (highly specific lol)
- in fact, much respect to the writers who dared to bring this story to life. imagine the challenge of pitching a story idea to Sony about not just one new Spider-man, but several alternate universe versions of them. It’s not exactly comparable to a Disney movie plot after all, but they pulled it off
- between this movie and the PS4 game, I’m happy that Miles is making further inroads into the cultural zeitgeist
- Miles appearance here reminds me of Hey Arnold’s black friend lol
- maybe I would have appreciated the movie a bit more if I was into hip-hop or such
- comic book fans will be happy to know that this movie does *not* follow the actual Spider-Verse comic book arc along with its convoluted background of the inheritors. The plot and the opposition are much more straightforward
- Will Mama like it? Well …like all animated movies, with enough viewings at home by my nieces/nephews, maybe.
- This movie has the best post-credits scene of all time

### TV

#### Black Mirror season 4

<time>[2018-01-10 00:02] </time> Black Mirror S4 spoiler-free review! (episodes listed from most enjoyed to least):

4.6. Black Museum (reminds me of White Christmas)

4.1. USS Callister (fun, but I was annoyed by how infeasible the technical premise was)

4.4. Hang the DJ (kind of telegraphed the ending)

4.3. Crocodile (felt like a police procedural)

4.5. Metalhead (would have probably appreciated it more if it wasn't a Black Mirror episode)

4.2. Arkangel (kinda boring and draggy)

Overall I liked S3 a lot more

---

#### The Gifted

<time>[2018-01-20 20:53] </time> If you're an X-Men fan and you're not watching The Gifted, you're really missing out. It's a more serious, street-level take on "the mutant problem" than the movies could ever handle.

#### Punisher

<time>[2018-01-24 18:23] </time> I had put off watching PUNISHER (on Netflix) since i wasn't really too hyped about it. But now that I finally got around to it, I really like it.

The pacing was good throughout the season (which was one of the weakness of the recent MCU Netflix seasons such as Luke Cage, Iron Fist and Defenders) and it didn't falter halfway through and stuck the landing.

#### Star Trek Discovery season 1

<time>[2018-02-01 22:45] </time> My train of thought as I'm catching up with Star Trek Discovery

- this is great
- there's no way they could have done most of this stuff while Gene Roddenberry was around
- I know we just got a Netflix series, but I think Jason Isaacs could play The Punisher

[Comments](#comment-75c9118d-410d-44ec-bb0d-9ca401803dc0)

<time>[2018-02-12 20:02] </time> Discovery had a great S1 ending, especially since I'm currently watching TOS as well

[Comments](#comment-4715a974-240e-481d-88fb-cb8dc44047f2)

#### Star Trek

<time>[2018-02-07 23:22] </time> After catching up with Discovery, I started watching Star Trek TOS as well. (I had never watched it before.) Talk about a stark contrast

<time>[2018-02-17 07:17] </time> The most unbelievable part of Star Trek TOS has to be that whenever they find a class M planet occupied by an atomic-era human civilization, that planet has a single worldwide homegenous culture

---

#### Jessica Jones season 2

<time>[2018-03-10 12:25] </time> Jessica Jones S2: In which dark things happen and everyone crosses lines they shouldn't cross

Jessica finds out about her powers' origin, meets her mom. Trish Walker gains powers. Karl Malus is killed.

#### Luke Cage season 2

<time>[2018-07-07] </time> Editing this in 2024 to add this entry. Apparently I had watched Luke Cage season 2 on Netflix and had not logged a review. I initially thought I had missed it, so I checked out the first episode on Disney+ and a lot of it looked familiar so I checked my NF viewing history. Watched the first episode on 6/23 and binged the second half of the season from 7/5-7/7. I don't remember much, but apparently this season's villain was Bushmaster. I also found some comments from me about one of the characters (I assume Bushmaster) having an accent that I wouldn't be able to understand without subtitles. Also, this season aired after Avengers Infinity War, so I had been hoping someone gets dusted in an epilogue or whatever, but no such luck.

---

#### Final Space season 1

<time>[2018-07-27 23:36] </time> I randomly misclicked on this animated show on Netflix, Final Space, and decided to binge it. Pleasantly surprised to find it was pretty good, and David Tennant was the main antagonist. Decent sci-fi, kinda adolescent humor, did not see that S1 ending coming

#### Young Justice seasons 1 and 2

<time>[2018-08-16 16:37] </time> Rewatching Young Justice in anticipation of S3. This series was great, easily the best of DC's animated series overall.

---

#### Iron Fist season 2

<time>[2018-09-13] </time> Editing this in 2024 to add this entry. Apparently I had watched this season and had not logged a review. I initially thought I had missed it, so I checked out the first episode on Disney+ and a lot of it looked familiar, so I checked some chat logs and found I finished it about a week after the season dropped. It looks like I liked the season much better than season 1 and found the ending adequate, though IDK if any of that ever happened in the comics. I did end up rewatching the season finale to recall what happened this season. At least we got an actual martial arts-focused big bad and the fight choreography was much better this season.

It's too bad this series ended where it did, it hinted at so many things that could have been good, like Nightwing restorations, and the pirate queen Iron Fist etc.

---

#### Daredevil season 3

<time>[2018-10-23 08:47] </time> Daredevil Season 3 spoiler-free review

- This season is amazing. I was planning on watching the season over a period of 3-4 days. Instead I ended up finishing it all in one day, ending at 3 in the morning. The pacing was tight and there was no good place to stop as you always wanted to know what happens next
- The entire cast gave great performances
- Wilson Fisk comes out strong to carry the season, looming over Hell's Kitchen and presenting a sinister, cunning, and apparently unstoppable criminal mastermind
- Wilson Bethel's Ben Poindexter is seemingly unbeatable in combat and gives us some great fight scenes and a fantastic performance
- Ugh, I wish I could write spoilers lol
- I used to consider Daredevil S1 to be the best of the Marvel/Netflix seasons so far; I think I have to crown a new champion

#### Arrowverse: Elseworlds

<time>[2018-12-12 21:30] </time> Arrowverse Elseworlds crossover spoiler-free review!

- if you’re not aware, episode 1 - Flash S05E09, episode 2 - Arrow S07E09, episode 3 - Supergirl S04E09
- I don’t usually review TV show crossovers but TBH I can’t recall any other any TV show crossovers and I just really, really enjoyed this one
- basically a love letter to DC comics fans, a celebration of dc comics/TV/movies from the past four decades, and apparently a prelude of things to come. Non-comicbook fans might not be as happy as me lol
- all three episodes were great (middle episode slightly worse because Arrow lol), I was smiling all the time and apploauding all the references
- frankly not everything made sense, but I’ll forgive it (I mean, have you *read* crisis on infinite earths? lol
- bonus: for more zaniness, also watch this week’s Legend’s of Tomorrow, they didn’t want to be outdone!
- I also watched Aquaman today, and that was fine (review later) but I decided to write a review of this crossover first!
- tonight’s reading list (image attached)
