I only recently found out about Github pages, which allows you to serve static content out of a Github repository, with a `github.io` subdomain. You can also point a domain name to it if you want (I haven't tried that yet). It's a quick and easy way to host a static site for free.

Here's mine: [roytang.github.io](https://roytang.github.io) and [the corresponding repo](https://github.com/roytang/roytang.github.io/). There isn't really anything there right now, I just put up some links so I'd have something. In theory since this blog is using static content now, I could host it on there. I'm running a few other apps on my current webhost ([Webfaction - affiliate link](https://www.webfaction.com/?aid=7808)) though so I don't think I'll be moving soon. (and I besides, I kinda just prepaid for the next year.)

I've seen some people put a second blog there. Or maybe I could host my resume there. IDK. Any ideas?
