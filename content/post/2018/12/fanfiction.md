This might surprise you, but I tried my hand at writing fanfiction back in the day. Most of it was Final Fantasy-related (as that was what I was really into back then) and the odd Ranma 1/2 one (mainly because I was a member of an anime-focused fanfic collective, called the "Nikholas F Toledo Zu" for inside joke reasons, writing under the name "Vector"). 

Anyway, I'm not exceptionally proud of the writings, but I like having all my work available on this blog/website/whatever, so I've added them at this link: [Fanfiction](/tags/fanfiction/). Give them a read, if you'd like. The Final Fantasy ones are also available at [my user page on Fanfiction.net](https://www.fanfiction.net/u/107111/roytang). The Ranma one I can't find anywhere else on the web, for some reason. 

It was kind of fun going through these again. Hmm, since I've been having trouble finishing original fiction projects, maybe I should try my hand at Fanfiction again, might be easier? I'll think about it.
