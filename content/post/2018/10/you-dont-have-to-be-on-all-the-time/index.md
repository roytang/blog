Reminders:

  * You don't have to be on all the time.
  * You don't have to optimize everything all the time
  * You don't have to be at maximum productivity all the time
  * You don't have to be the best at everything you do all the time
  * You don't have to be the smartest person in the room all the time
  * You don't have to worry about everything all the time
  * You don't have to be strong enough for everyone all the time
  * You don't have to solve everyone's problems all the time

There had been some suggestion that people with the above traits (hypercompetitive, always wanting to optimize everything, manage their time, be productive etc) have a [higher tendency for heart disease or cardiovascular problems][1], although that theory is in question. For sure though, the so-called Type A behavior makes one more vulnerable to stress and/or burnout.
