title: Worldwake Set Recap
---

### Preview Season

<time>[2009-12-09 22:42] </time> They should reprint Dodecapod in #WorldWake, that would solve Blightning

<time>[2009-12-10 06:34] </time> #mtg #WWK Celestial Colonnade (R) Land ETB tapped T: U or W. 3UW: Becomes 4/4 u/w elem w/flying and vigilance until EOT https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/magic-fundamentals/the-rumor-mill/226949-wwk-celestial-colonnade-buy-a-box-promo#c1

<time>[2009-12-18 00:45] </time> with Jace's +0 Brainstorm, I'm now speculating on Misty Rainforests on MTGO

<time>[2010-01-23 23:00] </time> #mtg Some nice cards, but overall I'm not yet very impressed with #WorldWake

### Prerelease

<time>[2010-01-30 22:13] </time> Only went 3-1 at the Worldwake prerelease. Mana screw FTL. =/ #mtg #wwk

[06:31] In addition to the the promo card, I got a Comet Storm in my sealed pool, and one more in my prize packs. :D #mtg #wwk

### Others

<time>[2010-02-21 12:06] </time> #mtg flavorwise, why does Vampire Hexmage have first strike?

<time>[2010-02-27 22:23] </time> #mtg opening packs has way too much variance. 1st wwk pack I bought: foil abyssal persecutor. 2nd wwk pack I bought: Goliath Sphinx. Hooray!
