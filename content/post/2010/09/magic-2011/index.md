### Preview Season

<time>[2010-06-08 06:44] </time> Woah scry in m11! Hope we get Magma Jet! RT [@dailymtg](https://twitter.com/dailymtg/): (Kelly) ...this M11 preview! http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/m11/augury_owl.jpg

<time>[2010-06-21 13:08] </time> For some reason I thought M11 previews started this week. I am disappointed.

<time>[2010-06-25 19:52] </time> Still missing from today's M11 spoilers: Steel Overlord, Roc Egg, Frost Titan. #mtg I'll go to sleep, maybe they'll be there when I wake up!

<time>[19:54]</time> Ah, Steel Overseer just got spoiled! http://bit.ly/aeH6RW #mtg

<time>[2010-06-26 17:51] </time> Seriously? Imperious Perfect?

<time>[20:30]</time> I'm not sure I get it. Isn't Overwhelming Stampede just a crappier Overrun at rare? Sure, the CC is slightly easier, but still... #mtg

<time>[20:38]</time> Combust needed "can target creatures with protection or shroud as if they did not have protection or shroud" #mtg #m11

<time>[2010-06-27 16:12] </time> Someday, someone will take out 4 O-Rings and 4 Spreading Seas with a single Back to Nature. It's going to be legendary! #mtg #m11

<time>[18:10]</time> Goblin Balloon Brigade was reprinted so red decks could have a Goblin that could fly over Wall of Omens. #mtg #m11

<time>[18:22]</time> Amused at the thread on salvation about the possibility of Goblin Piledriver being reprinted. It always reminds me of wrestling. #mtg #m11

<time>[18:30]</time> I hope Eternal Witness gets reprinted now that she's out of extended. There's still space for her in the number crunch! #mtg #m11

[Comments](#comment-24196e99-c702-4232-9a09-d66baafc4137)

<time>[2010-06-28 12:06] </time> Boo SGC is out. #mtg #m11

<time>[12:11]</time> #mtg #m11 [@mtgaaron](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/) just confirmed Elvish Archdruid reprinted, that should debunk the silly Imperious Perfect rumor?

<time>[12:11]</time> I think Grave Titan is easily the strongest of this cycle. #mtg #m11

<time>[12:15]</time> Interestingly, Green Titan gets any lands, not just basics. #mtg #m11

<time>[13:37]</time> Today's previews weren't as exciting as I had hoped. Though Grave Titan is solid, we already knew about this cycle. #mtg #m11

<time>[13:42]</time> Gaea's Revenge needed trample. Or "Protection from nongreen" #mtg #m11

<time>[13:45]</time> Hm... [@maro254](https://twitter.com/maro254/) 's article mentioned "rare and mythic rare cycle that you'll be learning about pretty soon", what are they? #mtg #m11

<time>[23:54]</time> Aw man, the number crunch already rules out Char in #m11. I need a replacement for Staggershock, it's kinda bad unless opp's at 4. #mtg #rdw

<time>[12:19]</time> Turn 5/6 Primeval Titan fetching 2 Eldrazi temple. Untap, swing, 2 more Temples, land drop, Emrakul. #mtg

<time>[23:56]</time> I wonder if Wizards will someday have a set with randomly assigned card numbers. Just to screw with number crunchers. #mtg

<time>[12:26]</time> I would love me some of those Japanese alt. art Jace/Chandras. Probably gonna be hella expensive though. #mtg

<time>[2010-06-30 12:10] </time> Pyretic Ritual - first Timetwister, now Dark Ritual? #mtg #m11

<time>[13:57]</time> I hope [@fivewithflores](https://twitter.com/fivewithflores/) has something good for us tomorrow. Other than the Lich, the previews this week have been a bit meh. #mtg #m11

<time>[16:28]</time> I hope a pull a Juggernaut at the prerelease and fight today's preview card. I get to say "I'm the Juggernaut, Lich!" #mtg #m11

[Comments](#comment-1429e169-c1b4-40e1-8408-f36704d6f597)

<time>[2010-07-01 09:41] </time> I think more people would be happy than sad if JaceTMS was in #m11 #mtg

<time>[12:16]</time> Fauna Shaman: Now that's what I'm talking about! As usual, [@fivewithflores](https://twitter.com/fivewithflores/) delivers the best previews. #m11 #mtg

<time>[12:24]</time> Leyline of Anticipation: If your blue opponent has this out on turn 0, you're now playing a very different (and unfair) game. #m11 #mtg

<time>[12:24]</time> Leyline of Anticipation: On the other hand, it might be possible to board this in AGAINST blue decks. #mtg #m11

<time>[14:03]</time> I hope red gets "Leyline of X: All creatures lose shroud and protection. Damage can't be prevented. Players can't gain life." #m11 #mtg

<time>[14:07]</time> Why do Relentless Rats keep getting reprinted? At least make it common so that it enables an exciting draft archetype! #mtg #m11

<time>[16:58]</time> Fauna Shaman is a great card. That's a terrible name though. #mtg #m11

<time>[17:04]</time> There was a rumor of Exotic Orchard reprinted because it appeared in [@dailymtg](https://twitter.com/dailymtg/) card of the day. What about Emblem of the Warmind? #mtg #m11

<time>[17:05]</time> [@mtgaaron](https://twitter.com/mtgaaron/) [@maro254](https://twitter.com/maro254/) [@dailymtg](https://twitter.com/dailymtg/) Why don't we have an Orb of Insight for M11?

<time>[17:19]</time> Temple Bell, Kormus Bell, Junkyo Bell...we have the makings of a Bell deck! Draw a lot of swamps, make them creatures and pump them! #mtg

<time>[2010-07-02 19:23] </time> leyline of punishment: rdw wish granted. #mtg #m11

<time>[2010-07-05 12:30] </time> Destructive Force: This card is literally "Wildfire+1". Is it because six is the new seven? Will Wildfire decks return? #mtg #m11

<time>[12:31]</time> Autumn's Veil: This is pratically a green Flashfreeze. Will it be enough to fight the wave of new blue permission decks? #mtg #m11

[Comments](#comment-0dc28761-6717-4543-be07-95315dc6109f)

<time>[2010-07-06 06:53] </time> White Leyline: Really? RDW died again. Reprint Anarchy! #mtg #m11

<time>[12:27]</time> Slightly disappointed with the remainder of #m11. No Ranger of Eos, no Jace2, no Imperious Perfect, etc. Oh, and no [@Grizzly_Bears](https://twitter.com/Grizzly_Bears/)  #mtg

<time>[19:48]</time> Devastating Force: I love it, but makes me wish we had better signets. #mtg #m11

<time>[19:52]</time> Dark Tutelage: I would miss Phyrexian Arena a bit less if this guy could swing for two. Or at least cost a mana less. #mtg #m11

<time>[19:56]</time> #m11 reminds me of rav block standard. There's hierarch, wildfire, a dark confidant effect, leylines. But yeah, better signets, stat! #mtg

### Prerelease

<time>[2010-07-10 12:01] </time> passed a pool with grave titan, doj. I got 2x white leyline in return. #m11

<time>[17:12]</time> my #m11 prerelease record: an amazing 2-2! Prize packs had crap =/

### Release Party

<time>[2010-07-17 17:33] </time> My #m11 Release Party was chock full of playables - Overwhelming Stampede, Royal Assassin, bunch of removal, etc. Nothing of value though.

<time>[17:33]</time> Went 3-1 at the #m11 Release Party. Only good rare in my prize packs was a DoJ.

### MTGO Drafts

<time>[2010-08-23 00:13] </time> Someone cast Pacifism on my Balloon Brigade. Then I cast Pacifism on his Squadron Hawk. Mine was less awkward, so I won. #m11 #draft

<time>[12:35]</time> I played Act of Treason on my opponent's Yavimaya Wurm for just enough damage to win. Apparently, "that was gay" #m11 #draft

<time>[12:51]</time> Nothing quite like losing a match because you played Act of Treason on an opponent's Primeval Titan then failed to attack with it. =/
