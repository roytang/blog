Duels of the Planeswalker was the very first game I paid for on Steam! At the time there was supposedly a promo Nissa from your local WPN store you could get for prepurchasing the game, but I believe we never got this in SEA/the PH.

<time>[Mon, June 28, 2010, 7:22 a.m.]</time> So in DOTP, when customizing decks, I really just add cards? Can't I remove some of the crappy cards from the main deck? #mtg
