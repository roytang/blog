So the other day I was watching a video of [Scott Berkun][1]&#8216;s talk about the future of WordPress:

_(Go ahead, watch it first if you like, this blog post will still be here when you get back)_

I loved how he delved into the history of writing itself, not just of WordPress &#8211; harking back to the days of the printing press, etc. We live in such a world of privilege where anyone with an internet connection can easily publish his thoughts and words unto a worldwide audience, and yet for many people writing is a lost art that they don't partake in on a regular basis.

For the past few months, I've been one of those people, as I've neglected to update this blog (aside from a short spurt during the elections). I'm still actively posting bite-sized snippets of my brain on [twitter][2] and I even added a new outlet for random internet nonsense on my tumblr account [Easily Distracted][3] but I've been lazily avoiding the elaborate writing of long prose.

It's easy to find excuses not to write; for the longest time I was considering switching this blog back to WordPress (I'm currently running a custom Django-based blog engine of my own creation) and changing the theme, et cetera &#8211; the sort of busy work one gets into when avoiding something else.

Have I been avoiding writing? Maybe I'd fallen into the trap a lot of people fall into &#8211; thinking that I have nothing useful to say, so I better not just say anything. There's something about staring at a blank text box that you need to fill up that triggers a primitive part of our brains that thinks we should avoid pushing out our thoughts or opinions into the world for fear of being questioned or ridiculed. Maybe it's a holdover from the days that elementary school English teachers would force us to write reaction papers and essays with a required number of words or pages. (Few teachers ask for an N-page paper, they know students will just cheat by using double-space or large fonts.)

I've also been worried about the sort of things that I write; like a lot of bloggers I somehow fell into the mindset that I should limit myself to a specific set of topics such as software development or Philippine politics or whatever. It's a bit ridiculous, this isn't a topical blog, it's a personal website and I can (and should) write about whatever I damn well please.

Sidebar: If you're wondering "Why write a blog at all?&#8221;, try reading ["You should write blogs&#8221; by Steve Yegge.][4]. Looking over his reasons why not to blog, I don't even have the luxury of claiming I don't have enough time, not since I quit my job. (Hmm, I should probably write about that in a future post&#8230;)

So anyway, let's put this ramble to an end. I'll be writing regularly again for now, probably five times a week. Wish me luck!

I have the same problem. My excuse is "i'm not a writer&#8221;.
