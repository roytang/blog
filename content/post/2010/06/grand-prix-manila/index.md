Team Snafubar attended Grand Prix Manila 2010 in Standard format. This was a big one, it looks like at least me, Alex, Mike, Marnel played and possibly also Tinne and Paul.

I went in with 3 byes, running some form of Jund:

{{< cardgroup title="Spells" >}}

Unfortunately, I scrubbed out after my 3 byes, finishing 3-3! The matches I lost were all to Japanese players: Yuuya Watanabe, Yuta Takahashi, Rei Coo.

IDK how the other team members fared, but they ran the following decks:

- Alex: Eldrazi Green
- Mike: "Roy Tang Special" Jund
- Paul: Mythic Conscription
- Marnel: Open the Vaults
- Tinne: Probably monored
