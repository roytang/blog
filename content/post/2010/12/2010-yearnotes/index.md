- I tried meeting with my own clients for the first time
- I resigned from work early in the year, took almost half a year off for my myself, then found that it was too difficult for me to work independently, decided to come back to the same company
- Had minor surgery that required me to stay at home to recover for about a month.
- I purchased my most expensive device ever - my [iPad](/2010/10/ipad-first-impressions-and-snap-judgments/)! Yep, it was more expensive than any of the desktop PCs I've had built. No wait, the most recent desktop is more expensive because I had to replace a 10k video card! The iPad is still a solid purchase of course 
- I had a niece! Well, I've had a niece since last year, but over the course of this year I've managed to spend a lot of time with her. I adore that little kid.
