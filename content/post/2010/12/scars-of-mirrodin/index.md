title: Scars of Mirrodin Set Recap
---

### Preview Season

<time>[2010-07-23 12:21] </time> Sword of Body and Mind spoiled! 'Tis awesome as expected. Sad face that it is mythic. Would the earlier Swords been mythic?

---

<time>[2010-07-24 03:17] </time> Wait, so Scars of Mirrodin is gonna have both a UG sword and an RW sword?

---

<time>[2010-09-05 05:23] </time> I like how Venser PW is 5cc. Recent "good" PWs such as SarkhanTM / Gideon were also 5cc, I guess wizards has found a good cost for PWs #mtg

<time>[05:25]</time> So, Clone Shell + Emrakul? No extra turn though.

<time>[05:39]</time> Metalcraft seems a bit too easy to trigger, especially with something like Stoneforge Mystic in std.

<time>[05:40]</time> Phylactery Lich + Darksteel Axe? Lich smash!

<time>[09:26]</time> OMG Elspeth makes 3 dudes!

<time>[2010-09-06 18:06] </time> After the weekend previews, today's Scars previews seem so tame.

---

<time>[2010-09-08 10:18] </time> No Orb yet? I'm hoping for Thirst for Knowledge reprint

---

<time>[2010-09-14 12:38] </time> Wow, I really like Precursor Golem. https://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/attachment.php?attachmentid=110589&d=1284437147

<time>[2010-09-17 12:05] </time> Woah new duals are sweet. http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/ld/108

[20:12] Must be getting harder to name duals...they had to invent a cycle of compound words!

<time>[2010-09-21 22:46] </time> It's hard to take Genesis Wave seriously in a format where Mana Leak exists. #som

---

<time>[2010-09-22 22:39] </time> They should have made a card that was like "T: Put a charge counter on this. T, remove a charge counter: proliferate."

---

<time>[2010-09-24 06:11] </time> If you have a Necrotic Ooze in play and a Myr Propagator in the 'yard, activating the Myr's ability with the ooze creates a 2nd ooze? #mtg

<time>[06:15]</time> What about if you Clone a Necrotic Ooze while there's a Myr Propagator in the 'yard, then activate the ability? #mtg #som

<time>[06:19]</time> Tunnel Ignus' FAQ entry should have emphasized how it is pronounced.

---

<time>[2010-09-25 19:30] </time> If I get one of each color mana myr into play, I should have an option to Form Voltron. #som #mtg

<time>[19:40]</time> Fun fact: Glint Hawk and Glint Hawk Idol are consecutive in the same common print run. #som #mtg

<time>[19:41]</time> Glint Hawk Idol sounds like a reality show where Glint Hawks compete while being criticized by Stern Judges.

### Prerelease

[Paper Prerelease Report](/2010/09/scars-of-mirrodin-prerelease-report/)

### MTGO Prerelease

<time>[2010-10-16 09:23] </time> Gah MTGO being really laggy and crashy on me in the middle of the Scars Online Prerelease &gt;.&lt;

<time>[20:28]</time> Scars of Mirrodin PR sealed pool: http://imgur.com/WKxVC.jpg What do you think? Am I doing it wrong?

<time>[20:45]</time> Anyone else experiencing severe lag on MTGO today? Or is it just me?

<time>[21:39]</time> it turns out that if you have precursor golem, it's a bad idea to grip of darkness an opposing golem artisan
