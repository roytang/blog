<time>[2010-01-10 01:14] </time> #mtgo arg MTGO isn't letting me log in!

---

<time>[2010-01-19 07:54] </time> #mtg I was like: should I sell these RGD packs, or open them and hope for duals. I was greedy and opened for duals. Mistake!

---

<time>[2010-05-08 16:58] </time> ick #mtgo is like molasses today. anyone else experiencing this? #mtg

---

<time>[2010-06-22 15:41] </time> I love how MTGO likes to crap out in the last round of an event.

#### Playing RDW on MTGO

<time>[2010-06-23 07:26] </time> the best thing about RDW has to be the ability to win with one land for the entire game #mtg

<time>[07:38]</time> My opponent cast All is Dust to kill a Goblin Guide. :D #mtg EOT I burn for 7, then untap and burn for 4 more.

<time>[2010-06-28 21:23] </time> "Kor Firewalker: Giving people with no skill the ability to beat red since 2009." - from a forum post on MTGSalvation

<time>[2010-06-28 22:29] </time> I find that a lot of losses come from keeping questionable hands and hoping to draw a particular set of cards. #mtg

<time>[2010-06-28 23:38] </time> It's sometimes annoying how RDW lives or dies with T1 Goblin Guide. But not as annoying as KFR #mtg #rdw

<time>[2010-06-29 18:25] </time> Some of my RDW stats: Over 55 tournament matches, won 75% of game ones, but only 61% of matches overall. #mtg I blame Kor Firewalker.

<time>[2010-06-29 18:28] </time> Now playing: 5th Jund matchup in a row. #mtg

<time>[2010-06-29 18:38] </time> Mull to 5 vs Jund, then revealing Blightning off the T1 Goblin Guide = NOT COOL

<time>[2010-07-10 08:15] </time> RDW mirror is ridiculous when both have D-Claws out

---

<time>[2010-07-19 14:25] </time> I got 3 Heat Rays in an ROE draft wtf

---

<time>[2010-07-23 12:23] </time> I have to earn like 390 more MTGO PR points to get a jitte!

---

<time>[2010-07-24 23:26] </time> Converting all my ALA block cards into tix on MTGO...won't play constructed online til SOM.

---

<time>[2010-07-27 02:03] </time> My problem with MTGO is the distractions (web browsing, etc), leading to stupid losses like forgetting to tap your opp' s attacker. =/

---

<time>[2010-08-05 17:58] </time> I opened a Primeval Titan on MTGO, I'm not planning to use it. Should I sell it now, or will it go up in price later? #mtg

---

<time>[2010-08-07 08:49] </time> Opponent was at 3, had Cloud Crusader. I played Triskelion and was going to shoot the flier. Luckily he scooped before my awkward plan. #mtg

<time>[10:15]</time> Inferno Titan? Sure! Untap, Act of Treason, gg. #mtg

<time>[2010-08-22 19:54] </time> Looks like Serra Ascendant spiked on mtgo - probably due to [@Conley81](https://twitter.com/Conley81/) 's deck at usnats

---

<time>[2010-09-02 17:35] </time> My first ever MD5 draft: http://imgur.com/d51Kz.png It's probably terrible. But I got a Chrome Mox and a Sword of Light and Shadow!

---

<time>[2010-09-23 12:31] </time> I wish the [@mtgonline](https://twitter.com/mtgonline/) store would just sell "subtix" worth 1/100 of a ticket each. I hate having those fractional ticket credits with bots.

---

<time>[2010-12-02 15:49] </time> Anyone willing to help a guy out with some scars commons on mtgo? I can offer some commons from older sets in return
