#### Spaceballs (1987)

<time>[2010-03-07 17:38] </time> Watching "Spaceballs" on Star Movies

#### Kick-Ass (2010)

<time>[2010-04-17 23:05] </time> Just game back from Kick-Ass. Good movie, 8.5/10! Not many people are watching it though, the theatre was almost empty when we got in.

#### Iron Man 2 (2010)

<time>[2010-05-02 19:53] </time> heading out for Iron Man 2!

<time>[2010-05-03 00:13] </time> Iron Man 2 was okay, but it was pretty much more of the same. Therefore it does not wow as much as the first movie did.

#### Zombieland

<time>[2010-06-17 09:04] </time> watching Zombieland

#### Toy Story 3 (2010)

<time>[2010-06-27 23:08] </time> Just came back from Toy Story 3

#### Inception (2010)

<time>[2010-07-16 19:55] </time> Going to watch inception

#### Shutter Island (2010)

<time>[2010-07-22 14:00] </time> Just saw Shutter Island. Where did I read someone comparing it to Inception? Not even close.

Notes from my journal: 

> So I saw Shutter Island yesterday. It's ok, but definitely not as good as Inception. It doesn't help that I was expecting a twist ending from the very start. Also, what made me think Chris Nolan was involved with this one also?

#### Expendables

<time>[2010-08-22 23:00] </time> Watched Expendables with the JV crew @ [Robinsons Galleria](/locations/robinsons_galleria)

Notes from my journal: 

> The Expendables was okay, action-packed movie but with some lame lines/jokes that we believe were written by Stallone as he co-wrote the screenplay. We were imagining him going "oh, this is going to be so cool, the audience is going to love it", etc.

#### Despicable Me

<time>[2010-09-04 21:30] </time> Watched Despicable Me with Chry, Jaime, KC and Pam at [Shangri-La Plaza](/locations/4b5173b3f964a520924d27e3).

Notes from my journal: 

> Despicable Me was okay, a few laughs, but not a laugh-all-you-can riot like some other animated films. It was a sappy family movie at the end, although that should have been seen coming since the three little girls were introduced.

#### Drunken Master (1978)

<time>[2010-09-25 21:05] </time> watching "Drunken Master"

#### Legend of the Drunken Master (1994)

<time>[2010-09-29 20:07] </time> watching "Legend of the Drunken Master"

Notes from my journal: 

> The great thing about these kung fu movies is that it makes it seem like everyone in china can fight and do kung fu like the devil.

#### Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)

<time>[2010-11-07 14:12] </time> Watching: Scott Pilgrim vs the World

Notes from my journal: 

> My brother and I watched Scott Pilgrim vs the world on Sunday. The movie is cool and awesome and pretty much what I expected, but I understand why it wasn't that big a hit financially and some critics criticized it a bit too much. You really need to be a gamer or comics guy to really appreciate it.

#### Dead Poets Society (1989)

<time>[2010-11-22 21:10] </time> Dead poets society is a great movie, but i hate watching the ending especially what happens to Neil.

#### Salt (2010)

<time>[2010-11-24 18:54] </time> Just watched Salt. While it's a fun action movie, I'm a bit unsatisfied with the explanations for Salt's actions

#### The Social Network (2010)

<time>[2010-11-27 22:13] </time> Watching The Social Network, but I keep imagining Michael cera playing Zuck

Notes from my journal: 

> The Social Network was ok for a movie, but of course I took it with a grain of salt because basically the whole movie came from a book where everything came only from the side of the cofounder who had a falling out with zuckerberg. I also had a bit of trouble taking some parts seriously because the guy playing suck looks a bit like Michael cera so I kept imagining the lines with cera's whiny little voice. It made some scenes more amusing lol. Overall the movie is good, and they didn't butcher the geek stuff too much. At least now I know zuckerberg was a real programmer.
