Interview the guy (since the woman was not in any state to be interviewed) and get an informative answer?\n\nCalling the DSWD hotline might have been the \"best\" thing to do at the time, but that's just effort transfer, and you're not even sure who's right. No smoking gun. No scarring on the woman's body (kung binubugbog nga siya, you would see it on her). It might have been just a scene, or still a lover's spat gone wrong, or actual domestic violence, but unlike police, you have no right to react to it without being intrusive as there is no physical evidence - good Samaritan or not.\n\nI would not trust the man's information, nor the woman's. So it's really hard to intervene in this case without a thorough investigation or background.",
