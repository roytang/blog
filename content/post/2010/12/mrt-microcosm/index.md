- Everyone pushes or elbows other people to get ahead
- Even those who don't like or want the pushing and the shoving can't help but go along with the flow.
- An elite minority sit comfortably in prime positions while the rest of the population struggle just to keep up with where they are.
- Many people are unsatisfied with the way things are and like to complain but don't bother to do anything to try to change it.
- It's overpopulated but no one is doing anything to control the population.
- The security provided by the guards is just for show.
- The more money you have, the farther you can go.
- The masses struggle vs each other for limited resources (space) and privileged few enjoy comfy seats
