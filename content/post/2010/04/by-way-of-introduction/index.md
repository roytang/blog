I'm a long-time Magic player from the Philippines. I used to blog at [my personal website][1], but I had this domain so I just decided to use it.

My magic blogging used to consist mostly of tournament reports (I like to play both limited and constructed). For this blog, I'd like to write more design/card analysis and about events in the Magic community. Most of online Magic community writing is geared towards an American/western audience, so I'd also like to write stuff relevant to the Asian magic scene if I get the chance.

Enjoy!
