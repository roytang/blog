Here's the situation: It's game 3 of a sealed game. You know your opponent has {{< card >}}Mind Control{{< /card >}}, {{< card >}}Aether Adept{{< /card >}} and {{< card >}}Plummet{{< /card >}} still in his deck, so you should finish it quickly to avoid losing to topdecks.

The field is as shown (click for larger view):
  
{{< img src="youmaketheplay.png" alt="MTGO screenshot" >}}

If you Stampede and swing with everyone, you win! Unless he has {{< card >}}Condemn{{< /card >}}, in which case you will lose. You never saw {{< card >}}Condemn{{< /card >}} in previous games. If you swing with everyone except {{< card >}}Platinum Angel{{< /card >}} he will fall to one life and you have to find a way to push through the extra damage later.

What's the correct play?
