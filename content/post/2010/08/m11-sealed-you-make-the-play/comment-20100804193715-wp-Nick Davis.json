He MUST block with the three critters (unless giant growth) to not die. 4/5 tree becomes unanimated again. Play the Stormfront Pegasus. If he swings with the team, sac the boar to gain 4, leaving you at 7, then chump the largest flier. You are at 1 life with one more turn.\n\nbut that's a LOT of speculation! :-D",
