### Nationals Qualifier #3

Aug 21 @ [Eton Cyberpod Mall](/locations/eton_cyberpod)

<time>[02:33]</time> 1-2-drop at the last natsq today. It was a 9-rounder! =/ Oh well, better luck next year.

So despite the laziness I did go ahead and attend the last NATSQ for the year, sporting my Jund deck. I lost the first round in 3 games to Dredgevine; if I had gotten a swamp instead of a forest with my last fetchland I would have drawn the game as I would have been able to play an additional blocker in turn 3 of extra rounds. I won round two against WG tokens due to fast geopede/leech action in games 2 and 3. I lost the mirror in 3 games in round 3 and dropped out. I wasn't really that keen on finishing the event to start with, as there werre 247 players registered, far more than NG had expected and the event was 9 rounds of swiss, which was ridiculous...the first 3 rounds took around an hour and a half each, it was 4pm by the time round 3 was finished, and I still had to [watch a movie afterwards](/2010/12/movies-tv-2010/#expendables) with some peeps, so drop I did!

Still, between reading about the decks at US Nats and being able to play in a tournament setting again has revived my waning interest in Magic somewhat. There's nothing quite like the thrill of the pressure of needing to figure out the correct sequence of moves to stay alive or win the game. I might just get some MTGO standard action going with Conley's life deck too.
