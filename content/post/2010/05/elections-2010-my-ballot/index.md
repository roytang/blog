title: Elections 2010 -- My Ballot

For President, I'm voting **Dick Gordon**, because I believe that the Philippines should be a meritocracy where people are chosen as leaders based on the strength of their accomplishments and qualifications.

For Vice President, I'm voting for **Mar Roxas**, as he's simply the most qualified and with the strongest history of government service. The E-VAT thing is actually a plus for him, as it shows he has the capacity to make difficult decisions if needed.

For Senators:

**Sonia Roco:** I believe she will live up to the advocacies espoused by her husband the late Raul Roco (whom I voted for in 2004). Focus: Education.

**Risa Hontiveros:** A solid history of advocacy and support for pro-people legislation during her two terms as AKBAYAN party-list representative. Focus: Healthcare, Women's Rights

**Neric Acosta:** Former teacher and three-term congressman of Bukidon, with legislative history focusing on environmental concerns. Focus: Environment

**Martin Bautista:** A successful doctor in the US, decided to come back to the Philippines to offer to serve the country. Focus: Healthcare, including reproductive health

**Alex Lacson:** I have to admit, I'm only voting for him because of his book "12 Little Things A Pinoy Can Do To Help His Country." I'm a sucker for anyone who is able to point out to Filipinos that change has to start with ourselves, even with little things. It's good to have new faces in the Senate instead of just the same old trapos. Focus: education, employment.

**Adel Tamano:** Originally I wanted to avoid voting for any NP candidates, given how ticked off I am by MV. But unlike the presidential race which is all-or-nothing, I prefer giving other parties some space in the senatorial race so that the Senate won't be a rubber stamp of the administration. Tamano is a good choice, he's another former educator (was head of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila) and adds representation for Mindanao

**Pia Cayetano:** The only other NP senator I'm voting for. Her advocacies include health, education, environment, youth and women's empowerment.

**Miriam Santiago:** A lot of people don't like Miriam for various reasons (_luka-luka, madaldal_ were some of the reasons people cited), but I'm not the sort of person to dismiss someone just because she doesn't follow social conventions. Miriam has been around a while and doesn't take any BS from anybody. Her presence in the Senate will keep people honest because she likes to call a spade a spade. At the very least, it will keep the Senate interesting. Focus: ???

I'm stopping at eight senators for now. None of the others particularly appeal to me.

For Mayor/Vice Mayor of Quezon City, I'm going with **Bautista/Belmonte**, mostly because I trust that Sonny Belmonte wouldn't choose idiots to take over after his well-respected term as mayor.

For Congressman and District councilors, I'm abstaining. I don't know who the candidates are, and even worse, I'm voting in a different district than where I'm currently residing, I have no right to decide the fate of district 3.

For party-list, I choose **AGHAM** party list (same one I voted for last time). It's sad that they are supporting Villar, but I'll just overlook that since I'm strongly leaning towards their Science and Technology advocacy. S&T; isn't usually a concern of ordinary Filipinos, but that's something that has to change as it's one of the ways we can climb out of where we are now and attempt to become an industrialized country.

Whew, composing this post took a while. I have to admit some of my choices were rushed (particularly for Senator), as most of my decision-making energy was spent researching the Presidentiables. Although things can still change between now and Monday, this will probably be close to my final ballot.
