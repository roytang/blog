One of my officemates is now a proud father-to-be! I'd be extremly happy for him, if not for the fact that he has to take a week off to attend to his family matters, and now I have to take up his workload. And just one day after I had finally managed to catch up to my own schedule!

I expect to be in crunch mode for a week at least. Probably two. Maybe more.

Ain't that just swell. I am so not in the mood.
