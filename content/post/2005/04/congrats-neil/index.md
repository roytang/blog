Speaking of my high school batchmates' earth-shaking accomplishments, props to Neil Simon Silva forÂ [getting 9th place in the recent bar exams][1].

Congrats as well to new attorneys Chris Bolastig and Ly-an Carlos.

Jeesh. It's getting harder and harder to keep up with my batchmates. When will I accomplish something that will land me in the papers? Or maybe I should stop being so competitive? =p
