Bomb blasts rock Davao, General Santos, Makati &#8211; INQ7.net
  
][1] 

> Makati City, three people were killed while at least 20 others were injured after an explosion rocked a bus plying EDSA as it passed underneath the Metro Rail Transit's Ayala Station, Metro Manila police chief Director Avelino Razon Jr. said.

What a way to celebrate Valentine's day. And here I was just [blogging about security issues][2]. (Although looks like this incident wasn't actually in the MRT.)

These are the sort of things they should be focusing on, not optical media piracy.

On a personal note, these things happen at weird times for me. Seems I always need a reminder that my own personal dramas are so irrelevant compared to such real-world issues.
