[RPGamer -- News Bulletin -- Namco, Capcom Combine Forces to Create Sim-RPG][1] 

Wow. I mean, wow. The game will feature playable Namco and Capcom characters apparently, and not just from RPGs. Street Fighter RPG! I'd play it. :p 

Note: This is the first time I'm using Blogger's BlogThis! feature. It's neat.
