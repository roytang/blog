Khan-fusion and a cabbie tale -- INQ7.net
   
][1] 

Cool story on INQ7 about a 40-year old cab driver who plays popular MMORPGs here in the Philippines. Goes to show how well MMORPGs like Ragnarok, MU, etc. are doing locally. Even though they're not considered "big" compared to American giants like Everquest and World of Warcraft, they've definitely captured the Pinoy market quite well.
