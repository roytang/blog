The whole web developer thing was boring me for a while. But last week I got to help on some preliminary webpage design for one of the projects, so my interest in HTML/CSS/Javascript is a bit tweaked. (Hence the slightly updated stylesheet &#8212; try changing font sizes now.)

Anyway, here's [some HTML/CSS trickery][1]. I'll add stuff here as I try them out.

If you're using IE, you wouldn't appreciate it much.
