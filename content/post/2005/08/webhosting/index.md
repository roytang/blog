I'm thinking of getting some webhosting. Not that I'm unsatisfied with my free webhosting and Blogger mind you, but sometimes I just get the urge to do some server-side chicanery.

Mandatory:

  * PHP/mySQL
  * Good service, tech support, fast response time
  * No-hassle payments (which means I prefer local, I don't want to have to pay through credit cards or anything)
  * Of course, a good deal on space, bandwidth, reliability, etc.

Optional:

  * Tomcat/JSP

Not ploghost though. :(
