title: Games - GameFAQs Top 100 Games (User Picks)
---

For it's 10-year anniversary, GameFAQs has released the <a href="http://www.gamefaqs.com/features/top10/top10_100.html">top 100 games</a> as chosen by its' users during their anniversary contest.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the general composition of the GameFAQs populace, 15 of the top 100 are Squaresoft games (including every single US-released main-series Final Fantasy), 17 are Nintendo games (5 Zelda, 7 Mario, 3 Metroid plus a couple more). Only 11 are PC games, 4 of which are from Blizzard.<br /><br />And poor Megaman didn't make it into the list. Good old Street Fighter II actually did better, coming in at 47.
