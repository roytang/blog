I was back in Pisay today, to attend my brother's graduation. He's the last of us, three brothers who all went through Pisay. I've never seen the pool up close before today. It doesn't look very deep.

I'm incoherent. It might be because I've been reading the [Sluggy Freelance][1] archives since I got home.

The graduation ceremony was mostly boring. I think most are, unless you're one of the graduates. Or one of the graduates' parents. Or one of those CAT guys who stops people with digital cameras from getting too close. Too bad I forgot to charge the digital camera batteries before going, or else we would have actually had more than five pictures.

The commencement speaker was some guy from batch '69 [1] with lots of degrees, awards and accolades. I swear, if I ever become commencement speaker, I'm gonna be really easy to introduce, since I won't have so much crap attached to my name. But you never know what might happen in 16 years [2].

The commencement speech was dull, the usual thing commencement speakers say, talking about the graduate's future, the uncertainty, the excitement blah blah blah. If I was the one giving a commencement speech (I have a feeling this blog post will be a basis for my never ever getting that chance), I'd probably talk less about hard work and more about passion. Hard work is nice, but it's passion, drive, energy that gets you places.

They have this new thing this year, where they don't have a valedictorian, salutatiorian, etc. Instead, they have people with "High Honors" (weighted average 1.50-1.20) and people with "Highest Honors" (weighted average 1.20-1.00) It's like the college system of cum laudes. Except it sucks. "Valedictorian" looks so much better on a resume than "Highest Honors", but if you're relying on high school accolades on your resume to land you a job, you probably won't get it anyway, so I guess it works out. Sort of.

Only teacher who recognized me there was good old Vlad. The guy's been teaching Econ for ten years! Well, okay maybe not. I heard he took time off to either take an MBA or go surfing in Hawaii, maybe both. But judging from the comments in the graduation speech, he still enjoys torturing the kids. Ma'am Serrano might have recognized me, but then again, she recognizes everybody.

The PSHS Gymnasium is an unforgiving boiling kettle of intolerable heat, especially during these hot summer days. I wonder if I will ever step foot in it again.

Edit: I'm a moron. I really was incoherent. I forgot I was going to talk about the ten years after part until I saw the title published on the page itself.

Anyway, yeah. Ten years. It's been ten years since I left Pisay to face the cruel world. And where am I now? No earth-shaking accomplishments yet? It's like when we were graduating, things were exciting, we were going out to conquer a brave new world! Maybe [peng][2]was right, ten years might just be too short to "Stand tall and shake the heavens" [3] At least, I haven't heard of anyone else in the batch stunning the world with their brilliance yet, so I guess I'm not behind, yet.
