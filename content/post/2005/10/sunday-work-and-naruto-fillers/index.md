I have to work today :( And probably tomorrow and the day after as well, although both are local holidays.

On what may very well become one of the company's biggest projects I might add, if we get the contract.

On an unrelated note, these filler Naruto episodes are just silly. It doesn't make sense that Raiga, one of the Seven Shinobi Swordsmen, can be defeated by Naruto and Lee (no matter how drunk Lee is); Raiga is supposedly on par with his former comrade Kisame, who was easily able to take on two of Konoha's jounins. There should be a big gap in power levels.

And what's up with Lee and Naruto pretty much shock-resistant?
