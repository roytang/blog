Wanting to catch the last RGD Sealed tourney of the season, I headed out to NG Galleria today for GPT Sydney. Unfortunately, their shipment of Rav tourney packs failed to arrive, so anyone who wanted to play had to play Coldsnap Sealed.

Bah, I got a terrible set, one of my rares was a Jokulmorder. Went RG/w, with the white being two Gelid Shackles that failed to show up whenever I faced down an Adarkar Valkyrie.

The good thing was that GPTs always give product prizes to the top 32 participants. And there were only 30 participants here. ðŸ˜€

For the record: 2-3. I think I should compile my win-loss record somewhere.
