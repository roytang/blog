So yeah, out of a strange mix of adventurism, inertia, coincidence and plan old boredom, I decided to install linux on this machine. At first I just wanted to see how easy the install would be, but after I nuked my Windows XP install I sort of had no turning back. (-_-!)

Anyway, I went for a dual boot of Windows XP and [Kubuntu][1], supposedly an easy-to-use Linux distro. So yeah, I even watched this [video online][2] that showed how to do the installs. (The video shows two guys doing the dual boot install with XP and Ubuntu, same difference.)

Okay, so yeah, I'm cool. I do the install and woohoo, I boot into Kubuntu, I'm awesome, yeah!

But my Kubuntu has no internet. :( It seems to have some sort of namespace resolving problem. I asked around on the kubuntu channel at irc.freenode.net and on the kubuntu forums, some nice guys gave me some stuff I could try, so I'll try again maybe tomorrow if I don't get home too late. (Can't right now as my bro is playing [DoTA][3] and his internet goes down if I reboot... )

(To be continued... )
