Yeah, so I was bored and went ahead and got a domain name. ^_^I'm wondering if I've wasted money, but webhosting is really cheap nowadays anyway. Thanks to the nice folks at [pinoywebhosting.com][1] for their quick service!

Anyway, I hope you'll pardon me if some parts of the site aren't fully up-and-running (the about page is still the wordpress template for one), I haven't had much time to play around with wordpress yet.

Farewell, Blogger. You have served me well, but it's time to try something new.

Done so far:

  * Imported posts and comments from Blogger
  * Go through every single post and assign categories (that took a while =p)
  * Updated many links / images in the posts to point to this server (There should be no more broken links... I hope)

I'm still gonna play around with WordPress, PHP and MySQL a bit later, see if I can get something nice going.

Cheers ^_^
