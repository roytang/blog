Awesome article in The Escapist titled [The Rise and Fall of Troika][1], which gives a good view of the problems facing game development studios with regards to production/publisher issues.

I got the link from the [blog at rampantgames.com][2] which I've been following for a while now. I find the articles about the indie gaming field very enlightening, and I have to say going the route of an indie game developer is much more appealling to me especially after reading about all the issues game dev studios have with big-time publishers.

Am I still thinking about getting into game development? Maybe, but not as much as before. I've come to realize that one of the important reasons I want to make games is because I love _playing_ games. So actually, as long as there are good games coming out, I don't think about it much. And I suppose I'm not yet brave enough to embark on such a risky venture for myself, but maybe someday...
