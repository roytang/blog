You could even use the\nold skins of WinAmp (Classic skins is the name... If they have .wsz at the\nname, rename it to .zip and it would work ;) Real neat huh?)\n \nBeep and XMMS have no problems playing mp3s out of the box.\n \nI don&#39;t really use the GUIfied stuff to play media. mplayer is still the way\nto go, as far as I am concerned, or EMMS in Emacs ;) (Which calls other\ncommand line tools like mplayer, mpg321, ogg123)\n \nhttp://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/MP3_on_Ubuntu_5.10\n \nIs that the one you checked? Hmm. What errors have you been getting? You could\nalways log on to #ubuntu or #ubuntu-ph using GAIM or X-chat and ask for help\n;)\n \nIt&#39;s weird that FF1.5 isn&#39;t in the universe :(\n \nUpdate your Ubuntu ok? There&#39;s something weird with [the password thingy][1].\n \nEnjoy Kubuntu!\n \n   [1]: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=143334",
