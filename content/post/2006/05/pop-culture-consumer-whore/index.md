Sometimes it's frightening to consider the existent of how much popular culture consumes our time. Most weekends I usually manage to reserve some time for some sort of learning, but over the last 48 hours, aside from work, my time has been swallowed by:

  * Lords and Ladies by Terry Pratchett
  * Episode 21 of Smallville Season 5
  * Episodes 18 and 19 of Simpsons Season 17
  * 8 hours of Suikoden V gameplay
  * ... and probably 2-3 odd hours of watching random cartoons or wrestling on TV

Hmm... I forgot to watch a movie though. At least I'm not a complete TV zombie... I'm usually either a PC zombie or a PS2 zombie :p
