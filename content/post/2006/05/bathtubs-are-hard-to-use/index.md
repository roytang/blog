I feel compelled to post this, in case I ever need to remember.

We spent last Sunday and Monday (Labor Day holiday) at a five-star hotel in Manila. My mom works there and she earned a free night's stay; so we took advantage of her employee discount as well. Not really very exciting for me, as there's seldom much to do in a hotel except to enjoy the air-conditioned room and watch TV. It was a bit interesting to stroll down the baywalk that night, but I'm not much of a nightlife person so I tired of it eventually. The highlight of our stay at Diamond is almost always the breakfast buffet. This instance was no exception.

That is all.

PS. Bathtubs are hard to use.
