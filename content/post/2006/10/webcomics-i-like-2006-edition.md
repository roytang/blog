I don't really read a lot of webcomics. Well, at least not as many as some people. I generally prefer the ones with feeds. Here are the ones I follow that don't have feeds. That is, I like them well enough to bother hitting their website to check for new comics.

[Sinfest
  
][1] &#8211; awesome. It's like a mature Calvin and Hobbes. Only with a talking pig instead of a tiger. And ninjas. And God!

[Real Life
  
][2] &#8211; gaming-related webcomic. Despite it's title, has nothing to do with Real Life at all.

[8-bit Theatre
  
][3] &#8211; gaming-related webcomic. I think this was the first one I started following. Ever.

[Ctrl Alt Delete
  
][4] &#8211; gaming-related webcomic. The humor is oftentimes low-brow, but it has some funny spots mostly due to slapstick or just plain insanity.

[Order of the Stick
  
][5] &#8211; gaming-related webcomic. of the tabletop RPG gaming type that is.

[Shortpacked
  
][6] &#8211; toys-related webcomic. Occasionally funny. I read it mostly so I can get a sense of an industry that I like but don't really have time to interact with.

[Questionable Content
  
][7] &#8211; eh, I'm not sure why I follow this. I'm not sure I can explain it, so from Wikipedia: "the style ranges between romantic melodrama, humor about indie rock music, and sexual or scatological humor&#8221;. I started reading it a while back and I stuck around. Not really funny. Well maybe it is if you follow indie rock.

And the ones that do have feeds:

[Penny Arcade
  
][8] &#8211; to be honest, if I have to explain Penny-Arcade, you have no idea what webcomics are. If so, and you are a gamer of any sort, go read it.

[Megatokyo
  
][9] &#8211; ditto. But to a lesser degree, and mostly for otaku.

[Pvp Online
  
][10] &#8211; this one is not as popular as the above two, but popular nonetheless. It's about guys working in a gaming mag, so more geekiness abounds. Eh, my feed for this seems to be dead. I'll look for a new one.

[xkcd
  
][11] &#8211; this is awesome and geeky, but not in the usual geeky way. The description is "A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.&#8221; Read it, maybe you'll like it!

Edit: Well, I was trying to figure out why I didn't have feeds of the first group, and I checked, and now I got feeds for all of 'em! The list above is kept in original form however.
