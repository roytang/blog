A friend of mine at work once commented to me that I ask the silliest questions.

When I'm a bit bored at the office, I will sometimes throw random meaning-of-life questions at them. things like:

"If you had a time machine, what would you do with it?"

"IF you were president, what would you do about [thing]?"

"What's your most impossible dream?"

"If you could vanish right now, where would you go?"

"What kind of superpower would you want to have?"

I wonder if I really am silly. But these are the sort of things I think about when my mind starts to wander. Are these not things ordinary working people think about? Or is it confined to that small percentage of adults that still have a bit of that childlike dreamer inside their souls?

Well, I really am silly.
