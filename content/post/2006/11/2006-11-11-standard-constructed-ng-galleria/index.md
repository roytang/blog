Same deck as [last week][1].

Round 1: 2-0 vs WUb Sliver-Mill.
   

   
I asked him afterwards why he didn't show me any Traumatize, he said it was only in the board.

Round 2: 2-0 vs Solar Flare
   

   
Game one he only gets four lands, he manages to animate a Skeletal Vampire, but Glare taps the blockers and pushes the kill.
   

   
Game two he gets nothing but ten lands and a Remand.

Round 3: 2-1 vs UW Draw-Go
   

   
Game one I push hard and fast, bringhing him down in eight swings.
   

   
Game two he gets the controllish upper hand and ends the game at 20.
   

   
Game three I push hard for a while and he manages to stabilize a bit at 6. He plays a Sacred Mesa with only six lands in play (I took out a couple with the Acid-Moss) and I think "Good luck maintaining that." I put up more pressure and finish with the Demonfire for three.

Round 4: 1-2 vs RU Control
   

   
Game one sees me getting beaten down bad. He has tons of counters, plus Hellkite and Teferi for the finish.
   

   
Game two I go Elephant, Elephant, etc. He doesn't have the answers.
   

   
Game three he controls the game completely. I don't bring him below 18.

Round 5: 0-2 vs UWR Angel Control
   

   
Game one sees an early Firemane and I'm unable to recover.
   

   
Game two I bring him down to 9 and I have the Demonfire! He repeals a Birds of Paradise to allow the mana leak to counter, and I lose to Lightning Angel beatdown.

At this point I'm starting to feel a bit light-headed. I think I'm coming down with a cold.

Round 6: 1-1-1 vs UWG Control (appears as 1-2 in the record)
   

   
Games one and two are boring.
   

   
Game three is quite possibly my stupidest move in the past year. We're both down to 10, he swings with five pegasus. I consider the lone Squall Line in my hand. "Squall Line for 4?" Remand. I take the 5 damage. My turn, I topdeck the Demonfire, assuring victory! I swing, saps make it through and bring him down to 5. And thus my stupid move: I played the Squall Line first, and ANNOUNCE IT FOR 5. Goddamn, I must've been really out of it. I was so excited by the topdeck that I failed to think. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. I offer my opponent the win, since he can still hit top 8 (he was paired down), and he can just split the packs with me.

Round 7: 2-0 vs Dragonstorm
   

   
I didn't even care anymore, I just kept playing the Elephants one after another. Dragonstorm is just. Too. Slow.

I finish 4-3, 19th, winning one booster pack, plus two packs from the 6th round deal.

That was a bit disheartening. Islands in every battle! I'm tired of this deck, I think I'll switch to a different deck next time. Something named www.IHateIslands.com.
