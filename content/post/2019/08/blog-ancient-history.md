title: "A Look Back At This Site's Ancient History"
type: post
---

I thought about making a tag "things that would only interest me" for this one lol.

I've uploaded some old web archives of the oldest versions of my site - back when I still had free sites hosted on the likes of Geocities, Tripod and the lesser-known TopCities. [Click here for the index](/archives/ancient/)!

I've had these archives for a while and only now decided to put them up on the site. It's fun browsing through the older versions, basically relics of a bygone era. It was a time of hand-made HTML, CSS and JS, something that appealed to the tinkerer in me. I remember a disdain for things like Dreamweaver's WYSIWYG site building, or the site-builder tools that came with these free webhosts. Real men build their HTML by hand! It was a lot of effort to maintain websites back then, but I had a lot of fun.

Some highlights:

- my obvious love for green-text-on-black-background color schemes (and unnecessarily small fonts apparently), harkening back to the computer terminals of old
- many, many broken links and missing files
- [HTML documentation of my undergraduate thesis](https://roytang.net/archives/ancient/htmldoc/). There's more documents from my EEE days buried in these archives somewhere if you feel like digging for them. Maybe someday I'll go through them in detail.
- [Final Fantasy meets Magic the Gathering](https://roytang.net/archives/ancient/tripod/ffmagic/index.html) - a custom card set I made in 2001 (!) which shows both how much I loved the FF series and how bad I was at balancing MTG cards. (TBF to me, balancing in MTG overall wasn't that good back in those days)
- [a half-assed attempt at an rk (rurouni kenshin) fansite](https://roytang.net/archives/ancient/geocities/rk/) - that's literally the title in the pages 
- [running documentary of me trying to learn Win32 programming for gamedev purposes](https://roytang.net/archives/ancient/topcities2002/works/prog/index.html) (largely unfinished)

I thought about including all of this stuff in the [blog's git repo](https://roytang.net/archives/ancient/geocities/rk/), but decided against it because:

- there's a LOT of files, it would unnecessarily increase the size of the repo
- I don't expect to be making updates to this content often once I've uploaded them
- I haven't vetted all the files, just the pages; there might be some stuff floating around in there that's not exactly legal (read: piracy). I've cleaned up what I can, but we don't want to run afoul of Github's policies or whatever so better safe than sorry

Most of the blog-like content had already been absorbed into this blog previously. It's fun to go through some of the other stuff too, like looking at a snapshot of the sort of things or sites or files I was interested in almost 20 years ago (unsurprisingly, mostly the same things as today!)
