<p>- I watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War! (And also 3 years to the day after watching Civil War)<br/>- I approve of this movie as a fitting end to the last decade of Marvel films. This is a slam dunk ending. They could end it here, with no additional MCU movies/shows coming out and that would be completely fine<br/>- I approve of how little information about the movie managed to leak, I approve of the trailers and the marketing campaign: just enough to get hyped but nothing too spoilery<br/>- There is a lot to unpack, but its impossible to cover anything without getting into spoilers, but I&rsquo;m very happy with the movie and the fan service, especially as a comic book fan. <br/>- the plot starts out slow and moves quickly at the end. If you have to pee, better to do it sometime during the first hour; I found myself holding my pee for the last hour of the movie and not wanting to miss anything, it was not pleasant<br/>- Imax was fine, but without probably also would have been fine<br/>- There is supposedly no post-credits, I wouldn&rsquo;t know as I couldn&rsquo;t hold it much longer and left mid-credits. The first half of the credits was nice though<br/>- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: No, same issue as Infinity War, too many characters to follow<br/>- They&rsquo;re going to earn a bajillion dollars with this one</p>
