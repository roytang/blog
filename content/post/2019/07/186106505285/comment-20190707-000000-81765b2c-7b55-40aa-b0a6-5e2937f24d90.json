I&#x27;m glad MCU Spidey seems more balanced, and has a better support system.    Also, I feel that MCU MJ is so much better than the comics MJ, who seemed to me to be a generic warm-hearted hot chick. In these movies, she&#x27;s quirky and more real and her own person. Though I bet quite a lot of white fanboys are still complaining she&#x27;s not a curvy redhead.",
