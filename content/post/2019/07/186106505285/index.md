title: 'Spider-Man: Far From Home spoiler-free review!'

<p>- I watched Far From Home while I was&hellip; far from home.<br/>- great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark<br/>- basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man<br/>- the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone<br/>- if you&rsquo;ve seen the trailers, you know who the &ldquo;villain&rdquo; is and you have certain expectations coming in. I was worried this would be a problem but it worked out fine, it wasn&rsquo;t a problem and was handled well<br/>- There is a mid-credits scene, possibly one of the best I&rsquo;ve ever seen, in terms of how it changes the entire tone of the movie. There is also a post-credits scene, the implications of which are still unclear and will leave the fanbase speculating for a while<br/>- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly! There&rsquo;s a lot of &ldquo;cute&rdquo; Peter Parker high school moments she&rsquo;d probably like, and the plot and action aren&rsquo;t too hard to follow</p>
