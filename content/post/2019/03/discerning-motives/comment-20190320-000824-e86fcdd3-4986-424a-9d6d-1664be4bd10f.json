(In my example, eminent domain and house displacement would be bad for the people living in the area.)    I guess, if you look for un-systematic (?) benefits from your candidate, it&#x27;s bad. But not necessarily private benefits for service? (eg. Compare:    1. I have a construction company, I see the election of pro-urbanizatio n candidate A as a business opportunity.    2. As 1, but I have worked with Candidate A before in construction contracts, so I have a leg up with the competition.    3. As 1, but I know I candidate A can be bribed so that I get the contract.    3 is clearly bad. 1 is okay because all construction companies benefit. 2 is also okay because the history is irrelevant?)",
