Not everyone sees the same steps to progress of course. But there are also &quot;outright bads&quot; that are outright indefensible, depending on your moral code, examples would be bribery, corruption, murders, etc. However, any absolute assessment of good/bad does not matter, the analysis in the OP only involves whether Person A sees his own motives as good/bad, as the objective is only to analyze what is motivating Person A from his POV",
