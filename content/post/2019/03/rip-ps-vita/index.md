[The PS Vita has officially ended production.](https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/2/18246372/playstation-vita-canceled-discontinued-production-ended-ps-vita-sony)

Sadness for the little handheld that could. The [PSP](/2008/02/i-have-a-psp/) that came before it was a juggernaut, and so was the [3DS it went into battle with](/2013/06/handheld-gaming-2013-playstation-vita-vs-nintendo-3ds/). Unfortunately Sony never gave the Vita proper support, and third parties didn't follow, so the handheld never lived up to its true potential.

I haven't had much opportunity for handheld gaming the past few years, since I don't travel as much anymore. But I still pick up my PS Vita every so often, much more so than my 3DS (which my niece has absconded with anyway). And I still have a few more games there I consider part of my backlog I want to someday finish. (Namely *Tales of Hearts R* and *Zero Time Dilemma*, at the very least) And my Vita is still doing pretty well, no obvious issues, so I'm hoping it can stick around for a long while.
