title: Four Hundred Thousand Words
type: post
---

Sometime in the last week, I broke past four hundred thousand words total on this blog, as noted on the [archive page](/archives/).

Four hundred thousand words! That number sounds insane for some reason. Over 17 years of blogging, that's an average of 23,500+ words a year. I could have written like 17 short stories or 8ish novelettes or 3-4 decently sized novels. 

This post is just me navel-gazing over that number. Four hundred thousand! In mid-March, there's gonna be another milestone too - we're gonna hit 1,000 posts total (assuming I don't quit blogging daily before then). I should get an achievement somehow!
