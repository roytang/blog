title: "Discerning motives"

Scenario: Someone I know, let's call him/her Person A, appears to be supporting Party B, who in my opinion represents some of the worsts traits of Philippine politics (including but not limited to corruption, patronage, personality politics, etc). Now, I like to be optimistic about people and give them the benefit of the doubt, so in a bid to understand I tried to list down some possible motivations for Person A to do so.

There are I believe two axes to consider:
- whether Person A believes Party B is good/bad for the country
- whether Person A personally has good/bad motives

Quadrant 1: Person A believes Party B is good for the country, and Person A has good motives
- Person A does not believe the negative things about Party B

Quadrant 2: Person A believes Party B is bad for the country, and Person A has good motives
- "Lesser evil": Person A believes that while Party B is bad for the country, other options are worse
- "Necessary evil": Person A believes the support of Party B (as a party in power) is necessary to get good things done and is using them as a means to an end to achieve better things.
- "Cynicism": Person A believes that Party B's politics is inevitably how the country works and to try to change things for the better would be foolish or a waste of time

Quadrant 3: Person A believes Party B is good for the country, and Person A has bad motives
- Person A does not believe the negative things about Party B (or does not care), and merely wants to use them to further their ambitions

Quadrant 4: Person A believes Party B is good for the country, and Person A has bad motives
- Greed/Ambition: Person A believes that Party B's politics is inevitably how the country works and is just looking out for theirselves

Due to my own leanings, I do not believe quadrants 1 and 3 are likely (I have yet to see evidence indicating otherwise), so this does not paint a good picture of Person A. People of course have complex motivations, and most of the time even the villains may see themselves as being the heroes. I can only hope that at worst Person A is somewhere in quadrant 2 and not quadrant 4
