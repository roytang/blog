Earlier this week, Google officially announced their much-rumored streaming game platform, [Google Stadia](https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/google-announces-its-video-game-platform-stadia).

Initial thoughts: 

- If this works out, it will greatly lower the barrier for access to AAA games, since people won't have to buy desktops or consoles anymore, and you would be able to game on laptops without worrying about overheating. 
- Sadly like many online services, it will probably be a while before it even becomes available over here in the PH (I believe even Sony's Playstation Now is not yet accessible here)
- One would presumably worry about how well it would work with the limited bandwidth available to third-world countries like ours, but I had this worry too when Netflix first became available here, and that worked out fine
- Speaking of Netflix, if Stadia manages to have a Netflix-like unlimited access service, that can only mean my gaming backlog is going to get a lot worse!
