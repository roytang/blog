title: Google Plus is dying
type: post

They're pulling the plug on it by end of this month. I got an email telling me to backup my content from there so I did, not that I had much. I don't think I wrote any original posts there, the export was mostly +1s and shares and such. Maybe I'll dig through it in detail in the future.

I wish I could say they tried their best with Google+, but they really didn't. It could have gotten a lot more support, but it felt like their heart wasn't really in it. Maybe the world could have been a better place if Facebook had more serious competition? (Or maybe it would have been worse, I don't know I'm not an Oracle)
