title: We can't be at our best all the time, otherwise it's not our best

Sometimes you just come up short. You try to work your brain but it always comes up dry. It happens, even to the best of us. There's no shame in failure or in defeat. It's only human. We can't be at our best all the time, otherwise it's not our best. What's important is you pick yourself up and try again the next day. Tomorrow, we can do better.
