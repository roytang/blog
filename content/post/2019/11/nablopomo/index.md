Apparently, [NaBloPoMo](http://nablopomoguideunofficial.blogspot.com/) (or *National Blog Posting Month*) is a thing. It doesn't quite roll off the tongue as the original *Nanowrimo* (which was already a tough sell), but I think it's a worthy endeavor nonetheless. Some friends were inviting me to do Nanowrimo again this year, but due to general life and busyness and other things, I wasn't able to prep. I could just wing it (maybe I still will!), but that likely leads to disaster! Let's do this easier challenge instead. Easier because I've already done daily posting on multiple months this year, and also in comparison to [last month's challenge](/2019/11/inktober-2019/)!

Some helpful tips and reminders for those who want to bring blogging back (did it ever really leave?):

1. A *blog* (noun) is series of entries, called *blog posts*, often primarily presented in reverse chronological order. A *blog post* (noun) or simply a post is a single entry in a blog, usually consisting of a title, a date, and some content in either text or some other media. To *blog* (verb) is to write one or more posts on a blog.
2. Blog posts can be anything you want them to be. They can be short or long. They can be focused on a particular topic, or discuss multiple topics, or be about no one topic in particular. They can have a title or have no title. They can be posted in the past, in the present or in the future. The sky's the limit.
3. Just write. Some may struggle with putting their thoughts into words because they're always looking for the perfect words or structure. Your posts don't have to be the best, impeccable writing. They can written first and then improved upon. The goal of an exercise like this one or Nanowrimo is to force you into the habit of writing freely and without filter, to learn to embrace the imperfect. So just write.
4. Struggling to find something to write about? Here are some prompts, choose one:
   - what have you been watching/reading lately?
   - what's something you tried recently?
   - what recent accomplishments are you proud of?
   - what's a recent failure you experienced and what did you learn from it?
   - when was the last time a friend asked you for advice, and what did you tell him?
   - when was the last time someone exceeded your expectations?
   - what happened the last time you went to a government office to get something done?
   - what's something you do or enjoy that none of your friends do?
   - what always annoys you when people ask about it?
   - what recent unexpected find made you happy?
   - try to draw a horse. then, mock your drawing
   - what recent article did you read that really impressed you?
   - what new blogs or social media accounts have you recently discovered and found interesting?
   - what's your strategy for saving money?
   - what's a recent restaurant meal you really liked? write a review!
   - what's a recent government decision you think was really good or really bad? discuss!

Enjoy blogging!
