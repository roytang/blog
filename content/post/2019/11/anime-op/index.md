title: Anime Opening/Ending Themes
---

Had a friendly discussion last night about our favorite anime theme music, figured I'd share some of my favorites. J-Pop in general and anime theme music in particular have a kind of energy that you just don't get from Western music. I think that generally I tend to favor those that openings for series that I had a chance to watch on TV (instead of via streaming/online channels), since back in those days I had to sit through the openings! (So most of these are rather old!)
