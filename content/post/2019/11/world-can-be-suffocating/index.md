title: The World Can Be Suffocating
---

The world can be suffocating.

You won't always have enough energy.

You'll have too much to do.

You'll fall behind on your commitments.

Bad things will happen at work.

Your problems will pile up.

Roadblocks will stand in your way.

You'll never have enough time.

Other people will come to you for help. You will bear the weight of their problems as well, even a little.

Then there's the problems plaguing the world around you. Politicians making bad decisions. People taking advantage of other people. Wars and death and famine and climate change.

All of these weigh upon you, and can make you feel trapped and short of breath.

It's alright to step back for a bit. 

Retreat into your books, your movies, your tv series, your games, your silent hidey-holes.

When you're ready, when you can breathe again, then come back to face the world anew.

Rest, recover, then catch up again.
