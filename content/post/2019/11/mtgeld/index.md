<time id="1177364696279601152">[2019-09-27 07:29] </time> Went 5-3 with my first Eldraine sealed. Not bad, but not very good either =/ #mtg

2 of my losses were to Garruk and Oko so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

<time id="1183365386974052352">[2019-10-13 20:54] </time> 2nd ELD draft. This archetype is great (maybe until the bots find out about it), but I only went 6-3 due to a misplay #mtg
