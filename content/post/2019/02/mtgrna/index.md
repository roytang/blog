<time id="1086044078876192769">[2019-01-18 07:34] </time> I opened 30 #MTGRNA packs on arena and 3 of the pulls were mythic WCs, pretty good rate

also did a prerelease sealed and did a horrible 3-3 with gruul and domri and nikya (kind of a nonbo lol)

<time id="1086245448245927937">[2019-01-18 20:54] </time> Did another #MTGRNA sealed, with Rakdos the Showstopper this time, still went 3-3. Maybe I should be doing tricolor instead of sticking to a single guild?
