title: Strange beds

I have my share of [sleeping problems](https://roytang.net/2019/02/insomnia/), but it gets slightly worse when I'm sleeping on a new, strange, unfamiliar bed. It always takes me some time to adjust to any new trappings, and I almost always expect on my first few nights at a new place that I won't get the correct amount of sleep or be awake at the proper times.

I wonder if there is some primordial instinct that causes us to be wary of unfamiliar sleeping arrangements, granting (against our will) heightened awareness in case of predators.

Leaves me more time to ponder life's mysteries at least.
