Just a fun little throwback: some years back me and some friends played an app called Draw Something for a while, where you draw stuff and send the drawings to your friends and they try to guess it. I had some screenshots stored in a Facebook post for a while and it showed up in the "Memories" thing, I thought I'd post them here on the blog too. We had a lot of fun with the app back then!
