It is human nature perhaps, to think about those alternate realities that might have come from different decisions or different dispositions.

If only I was braver.

If only I was more decisive.

If only I didn't have something holding me back.

If only I knew what I knew now.

If only I had fought harder for it.

If only I could speak to her again one last time.

If only I realized what it all meant.

While unavoidable, best not to linger in these alternate worlds too long. Regret is a trap that takes us away from the present. Learn what we can from our mistakes, and move on.
