title: This too shall pass
type: post
---

> It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence, to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: And this, too, shall pass away. How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride!how consoling in the depth of affliction! 
> - [Abraham Lincoln](http://quotationsbook.com/quote/44524/)

More quotes! I like ones that have a level of ambiguity, a meaning that changes depending on situation. "This too shall pass" teaches us to hope in times of desperation, and encourages temperance in times of plenty. Hope is a good thing, especially in times like these when many problems plague the world.

It also reminds me of Shelley's sonnet [Ozymandias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ozymandias), which reminds us that even the greatest of empires fade away:

> "And on the pedestal these words appear:
> 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;
> Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'
> Nothing beside remains. Round the decay
> Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
> The lone and level sands stretch far away."
