title: Depression or just laziness?
type: post
---

Sometimes I see posts like this:

and I can't help but feel like it's at least a little bit applicable to me. And I start to wonder whether maybe I'm suffering depression? Or maybe just a little depressed?

The question only lasts in my head for a moment. Despite my sometimes [bleak outlook for humanity](/2018/11/the-sky-is-falling/), I still consider myself a largely optimistic person and I understand life is generally good for me at least (at the moment). I'm like 99% sure that I'm mostly just lazy.

Or am I?
