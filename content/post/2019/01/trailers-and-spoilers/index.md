title: Trailers and Spoilers
type: post
---

The first trailer for *Spider-Man Far From Home* dropped last week. I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven't bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I'm already hyped enough for those, I don't think I have hype to spare for a third one.

My brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements. Specifically, he wasn't aware that [actor] was in the movie playing [villain]. I keep up with comic book news, so that wasn't news for me, but I can see how disappointing it might be. Also, this seems to be typical - I check the first trailer for *Spider-Man Homecoming* and it did show Michael Keaton's Vulture. It's hard to avoid the villain info, few people consider it a spoiler, it's usually right there in the IMDB page.

I do think that trailers these days show too much though. During the past few years, I've been avoiding watching any trailer beyond the first one that comes out. Although given that I follow comic book news, it's hard to avoid spoilers from succeeding trailer. Starting with the new Spider-Man I'm considering not watching any trailers at all (at least until I'm forced to watch one before an actual movie).

It might also be a problem with these comic book movies that they come from an established IP - so someone familiar with the source material like me basically already has an idea of what stuff might happen. The title alone of *Avengers Infinity War* gave me an idea of what happens in the movie after all.

I think the perfect trailer for a completely new franchise gives you a taste of what's to come without giving you details of the major conflict and so on. The *Captain Marvel* and *Shazam* trailers have been pretty good in this regard.

For a sequel, the perfect trailer for me would be the first trailer for *Avengers: Endgame*, which basically acted as a "story so far", giving no new info that we didn't know from *Infinity War*. Other than the actual movie's title at least, which I had been anticipating for a long time.
