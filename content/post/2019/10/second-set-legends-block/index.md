title: The Second Set of Legends Block
type: post
---

I like Wikis (probably because a previous employer used them a lot) so in 2005, I got an [account at PBWiki](http://roytang.pbworks.com) (now [PBWorks](https://www.pbworks.com/)) which let you set up your own Wiki. Unfortunately, I never did end up using it for anything significant, and every couple of years they have to warn me they're going to delete it, so I figured I'd just get the content off of it and let it die. If I ever wanted a wiki again, a markdown-based one powered by Hugo would be much more appropriate anyway.

The only significant piece of content I had there was a custom set design for a theoretical second set of Legends block. This was a riff on how Coldsnap was released supposedly the final set in the as-then uncompleted Ice Age block. I figured the older sets deserved the same treatment too and so I started putting together a hypothetical second set for Magic's first expansion Legends.

I do not claim to be a very good set designer for Magic, all content here is based on prevailing design ideas from more than a decade ago and are presented as-is. And reading some of this stuff, I have no idea where some of it came from.
