I finally watched Dark Phoenix today. It was not as bad as I thought it would be, but the #xmen jet did have a port where Cyclops could put his head so they can use him as a cannon, and apparently Nightcrawler can teleport 4 people across an entire city so there's that

some weird character choices too. I mean, Erik's lackeys were basically random unknown mutants (I didn't even realize who Selene was supposed to be until she fell off the train). Not to mention the obscure Marvel alien race in the movie.

At least we got our space firebird thingy so there's that
