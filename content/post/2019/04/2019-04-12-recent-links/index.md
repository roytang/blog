I usually log links to interesting articles that I read over on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com), which get fed into the [links list](/links/) on this blog, but that page only shows the most recent ones, so I thought I'd highlight some in a post as well.

- Recent science news: scientists have managed to image the event horizon of a black hole! Here's a nice article about [why that's a big deal and some interesting science stuff behind it](https://forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2019/04/10/black-holes-are-real-and-spectacular-and-so-are-their-event-horizons/#2e0d48cd5808).
- This article on [the advantages of stealth wealth](https://www.thesimpledollar.com/the-advantages-of-stealth-wealth-and-how-to-practice-it/) reminds me how my mom always gets on my case for wearing old and ratty shirts when I go out walking. I could probably write an entire blog post myself on appearing poorer than you actually are!
- [What does it mean to be a distinguished engineer?](https://blog.jessfraz.com/post/defining-a-distinguished-engineer/)
