I was struggling to remember the term - I knew there was one - for the type of stories where it's long-winded and the narrator is generally trying to keep the audience hanging and eventually ending in an anticlimax. These are called [Shaggy Dog Stories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaggy_dog_story), there's even [a subreddit for them](https://www.reddit.com/r/shaggydogstories).

The ones I heard the most growing up were from my high school crowd, and I remember two of them:

- the "bloop bloop". Basically, a kid is asked what he wants to do when he grows and he says "I want to invent the bloop-bloop!" and the story proceeds to describe the kid's academic growth track and at every milestone he repeats the same goal; he takes a number of courses, joins research projects, and at the end he announces that he has finished his life goal and invites everyone to a demonstration. He takes out a small round object and drops into a vat of liquid, where it makes the sound "bloop bloop"
- the pink table. A kid is asked what he wants for his birthday, and he says "I want a pink table!", but his parents get him something else. This scenario repeats every year. But I forget how this one ends.

I tried Google searching for the above stories, but because these were largely transmitted via verbal narration in the pre-internet days, it is unlikely there are "standard" versions of these shaggy dog stories recorded online.

The most famous shaggy dog story I do know of is of course, [Nate the Snake](https://natethesnake.com/). (The wayback machine tells me this site and domain have been up since 2012, that's neat, I'd have at least put ads on it by now!)
