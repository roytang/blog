title: Social Media Hiatus

I've written a bit [about the need to reduce social media usage](/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/), so this month I'm gonna give it a try and have decided to disconnect from Facebook and Twitter until the end of the month. Actually, the real motivation is to minimize the chances of accidentally reading spoilers for **Game of Thrones** and **Avengers Endgame**! But taking a trial run of a social media purge seems a good secondary reason too. 

I can still be contacted via email, and there's still a bunch of people I communicate with regularly through Messenger, so I can still be reached there. (Facebook's spinning Messenger off into a separate app makes it possible to take a hiatus from the social media part and still have the comms part).

Let's see if my will can hold.
