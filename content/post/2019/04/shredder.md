title: Shredder!
type: post

No, not the TMNT villain or the kitchen utensil. Some years back I jokingly put "a shredder" on a Secret Santa wishlist, which I knew was way outside the roughly $10 range that locals usually set for Secret Santa gifts. I put a lot of other options on (usually food stuff like quezo de bola or Spam), so I wasn't expecting to actually get a shredder. But I did!

It might be a bit weird to have a shredder at home, but I find it useful (occasionally). I use it mainly for shredding credit card and bank statements, for those accounts that still insist on sending me paper mail. I have this healthy bit of paranoia about having bank info on paper, since I know even an account number might be usable for social engineering attacks vs unsuspecting call center agents.

This paranoia extends even for the shredded papers. Mostly because of a scene in the movie *Batman Returns* where Danny DeVito's Oswald Cobblepot was able to get dirt on Christopher Walken's Max Shreck by painstakingly reconstructing shredded documents that had been disposed off in the sewers. So sometimes I like to dispose of the shredded papers in different batches instead of throwing them all out together. 

This was probably the best gift I've ever gotten from a Secret Santa, I'm still using it years later!
