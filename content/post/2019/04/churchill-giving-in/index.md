title: Churchill on Giving In
type: post
---

> "Never give in, never, never, neverâ€“never, in nothing, great or small, large or petty. Never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense."
> - Churchill

Persistence is a virtue, except when it isn't - there is some amount of good sense necessary to discern when one should just give in. As in most things, a balance is required. Unfortunately, good sense is not always in abundance in today's world.
