title: Gratitude and wonder

There is plenty of advice about how living a life of gratitude can lead to happiness. And that's fine, gratitude and thankfulness are good traits to have.

But in addition to gratitude, I would recommend wonder. That is, seek out wonder in your life. Put yourself into situations where there's a good chance of wonder, awe, or amazement. Seek out things that amaze you and make you go "Woah!"

You won't always succeed, but that's okay, the moments when you do will be worth it.

Life is amazing, especially when you take the time to notice all the little things that normally just pass you by without pause.

Be randomly amazed.
