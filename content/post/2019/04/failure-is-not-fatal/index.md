title: Learning from failure

I already typed the above quote into the post, then realized I had already [used it before](/2016/07/dealing-with-failure/). Whatever, just goes to show, I'm no stranger to failure.

I was reminded of this quote because recently I prepared a demo for a project that didn't push through. At first I was annoyed at the wasted effort, but I realized that I had wisely taken the demo project as an opportunity to learn/sharpen some skills. Specifically, I used it to study the Django Rest Framework (for the backend API), and a little bit of VueJS (for the frontend), which means that even if the project isn't going anywhere, I was at least able to hone some technical skills. The advantage of always looking to try new things is that your worst case scenario still leads to some self-improvement.
