title: Don't worry, be happy

I worry about a lot of things. Recently with the planning for the [US trip](/2019/04/i-got-a-us-visa/), the worry that comes to mind is financial: this trip is expensive, should I be cutting back? Can I afford this Airbnb? Can I afford going to Disneyland with my nieces? etc. 

All this worrying is silly of course. I already know I can well afford the trip, but the fact that it's so expensive triggers the spendthrift in me to worry that I might be spending too much and I might be on a slippery slope to financial ruin. Again, silly.

Sometimes when I'm outside I watch the people around me and such worries seem ridiculous when I realize a lot of people are worse off than me and yet they are able to thrive and survive and carry on with their lives enjoying simple things like a movie or a walk in the park. Even the poor or the unfortunate are able to enjoy daily life despite all of the problems around us. I'm reminded that I should not worry and just be grateful I can go on the trip at all, as not everyone can enjoy that privilege. Maybe someday I'll lose my privileges I do enjoy so I should take advantage of them while I can. And not worry so much, even if did manage to somehow get into financial ruin, I'm skilled and employable enough that I can still live comfortably even then.

Not to be preachy or anything, but all of this also reminds me of a quote from Matthew 6:26:

> Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?

Obviously the analogy isn't perfect, because you know, birds can die and be hunted easily, but the point remains. Many are able to live their lives with much less than what I have so I should be grateful and not worry so much.

Don't worry, be happy...
