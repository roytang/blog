Something random found today:
  
[Some guy's gallery of comic-book (and other genre) characters as lego people][1] 

And, for those three people who haven't seen this before:
  
[The Fight Crime!][2] 

The guy who made the above javascript thingy (website: [black-ink.org][3]) had a link to some sort of [online &#8216;zine about comics][4]. I don't follow comics much anymore, but apparently, [Peter David is writing something X-Factor again.][5] 
  
And according to a friend of mine, he's also writing Hulk again! Now if only I had the money and patience to start collecting comics again...
