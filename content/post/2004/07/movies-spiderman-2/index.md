I suppose everyone and their mother has had a chance to voice their opinions on Spiderman 2 by now, so here's mine: Some parts are hokey, some parts are cheesy, some parts are gratuitous Hollywood crap, it has quite a few inconsistencies and plot holes but overall, it's a hell of a ride, and I found it considerably more &#8216;fun' than the first one. That being said, I'm not entirely excited about the Goblin making an obvious comeback in Spiderman 3, but the only other Spidey nemesis worthy of being in a movie would be Venom... and bringing alien symbiotes in the equation would completely change the feel of the movies.
