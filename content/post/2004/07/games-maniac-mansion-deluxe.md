[Maniac Mansion Deluxe][1] 
   
is a 256-color remake of the original Maniac Mansion, done by a group calling themselves LucasFan Games. I'm not sure how legal this is, but hey, it's Maniac Mansion! 

Any adventure gamer worth his salt knows about the Mansion and Dave's efforts to save his girlfriend Sandy from Dr. Fred and the evil meteor. The great thing about Maniac Mansion (or not so great, maybe), is that unlike later adventure games, your kids can die, you can accidentally blow up the mansion and you can get work yourself into an unsolvable situation. I don't know whether Maniac Mansion was the last game to do this &#8212; I remember the game I played immediately after (Monkey Island) had no such &#8216;feature'. Anyway, it's still quite entertaining despite its age.
