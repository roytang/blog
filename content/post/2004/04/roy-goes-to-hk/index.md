Yup. This week, for the first time ever, I'm leaving the country, and flying down to HK to provide support for the rollout of the project I've been with for the past year and a half. First time to leave the country, and I'm gonna be flying alone to a country where people speak a language I can recognize but not understand. I'm understandably a bit freaked out; who wouldn't be, right? But everything will be fine, I guess.
