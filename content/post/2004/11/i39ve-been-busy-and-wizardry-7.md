... or maybe just distracted. After putting in some fifty hours over a four-day period last weekend, I thought I'd cool off for a few days, doing nothing but what needs to be done, and some surfing and sleep when I get home.

But I'm back! And I'm going to get my gaming groove on! I got a new copy of Star Ocean: Til The End of Time, hopefully this one's a good copy, I haven't tested it yet. I'll play it this long weekend (Monday = RP holiday, start of Ramadan); I will finish another PS2 RPG, I swear! Also, after years of trying I finally managed to get a working copy of Wizardry 7 again! Crusaders of the Dark Savant was the first RPG my brother and I ever played; we spent many sleepless nights crawling it's massive dungeons hoping our little fairy ninja would not get squashed! But we never finished it, for one reason or another, so this our chance to revenge! (Oh, and I finally got it working thanks to the [help of a dude on the GameFAQs Message Boards][1], thanks random dude! The answer was to use DOSBox, a DOS emulator available from [SourceForge][2])
