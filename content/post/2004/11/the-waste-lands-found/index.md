I went to the dentist yesterday (irrelevant), and at National Bookstore Shangri-la, I found a copy of _The Waste Lands_, a day after I blogged about looking for it! They also had a copy of the fourth book _Wizard and Glass_, but I only had enough cash for one.

On a website note, if you'll notice, I added entries from my [del.icio.us account ][1]to the blog. It's done using the excellent [Feed2JS tool][2]. It's cool. Check it out.
