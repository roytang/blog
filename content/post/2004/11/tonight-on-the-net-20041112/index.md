* Interesting read: There's thisÂ [spouse of an EA developer][1] who's taking it to EA's supposedly unfair labor practices on livejournal.
* Cool thing: AÂ [chess program][2] that shows you the computer's train of thought!
* [Interesting English Trivia][3] -- yes it's geeky ðŸ˜€
* Tech news:Â [Winamp is dead, long live Winamp!][4] I actually like Winamp, especially version 5. There are quite a number of things I'd like to change with it, but it's a lot better than WMP. I wonder if there are any other, better (or at least promising) alternatives?
* People who have too much time on their hands:Â [&#8216;King of Pirates'][5] has downloaded more than 900,000 songs!
