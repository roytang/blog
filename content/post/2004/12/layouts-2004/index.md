This entry is being published in **April 2021**. Around this time, I was digging around the wayback machine and found some old versions of my blog, so I thought I'd take some screenshots and psot them here, backdated into their proper place in the timeline. The two screenshots here are from 2004 and 2005, but I didn't want to bother creating two separate posts.

This was back when my blog was powered by [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com/) and it was hosted on a free web hosting service called Fateback. (I don't know why I didn't just use blogspot directly, which I would later do anyway...)
