I forgot to talk about this. We played [Champions of Kamigawa][1] Team Sealed a couple of weekends back. For the uninitiated, ChK is a Magic:the Gathering set, and Team Sealed is our favorite limited format! I think it's mostly because if we lose, I can blame my teammates for screwing up, unlike in regular tournaments where it really is my fault. :p And if we win? Free cards!

Of course, we didn't win. I'd like to say it was primarily because of a bad set of cards we got (I think we were the only team that didn't get a Honden or two... ), but we really made a lot of mistakes. Of well, it was a learning experience. An expensive one.
