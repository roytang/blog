  "text": "it&#39;s when people pass on that you realize how sayang the opportunity was to\nreally get to know them. when Sir Alix was my teacher, (or any math teacher,\nkasi nga i didn&#39;t and still don&#39;t like math) all i remember was looking at my\nwatch waiting for free cut to occur. Pero si sir nagbibigay ng leakage, sorta\nlike near the exams biglang buhos ng math (that i still did not get, btw)\ntapos lalabas pala yon sa exam. That&#39;s the extent of my memory. Kakainggit\nlang siguro yung mga students who were actually friends with him.\n \nit&#39;s peng now, and not sushie. at mike, pwede ba kita i-link?",
