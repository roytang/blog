Joel Spolsky, of [Joel on Software][1], is collecting nominations for the [best software related essays of 2004][2]. A lot of them are interesting reads.

Reading these essays make me realize that, well, I like being a coder, a programmer and a developer. (These are different things, figure it out :D)
