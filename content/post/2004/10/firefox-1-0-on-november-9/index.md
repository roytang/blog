In case you haven't heard,Â [Firefox][1], the little browser that could, is scheduled for the official 1.0 release on Nov. 9. There's a large promotion campaign going on over atÂ [SpreadFirefox.com][2], including a campaign to gather donations for a large ad of some sort on the New York Times. I'm still using 0.9, despite the availability of 1.0PR, but I'll surely get the official 1.0 come November 9. ðŸ˜€

BTW, there are someÂ [cool Firefox wallpapers][3]Â available.
