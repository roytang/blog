I was bored. And I was going through the

[Sinfest][1] archives. But then I thought, why should I bother going through these comics manually over the net? I'm a programmer, I'll make a [SinfestDownloader][2]!

I've left it running for about 4 hours now. There's a lot of Sinfest strips... around 40MB worth have already been downloaded!

I wonder if this violates any sort of copyright? ... 

Update: Done in a little over 4.5 hrs. Sinfest weighs in at a bit more than 1700 strips, and roughy 50MB of space. I wonder if I should try for Penny-Arcade? 😛
