### The World

- PH/Politics: The elections have come and gone and like it not, we must live with the results. I have written [some post-election thoughts here](/2022/05/post-election-thoughts/).
- PH/sports: Some good news though: Last Friday the UP Maroons defeated ADMU in the final game of the UAAP basketball season, ending a 36-year drought. The Maroons last won the championship after the dictatorship fell. I'm not big on sports, but even I found myself closely following the last quarter and overtime. It was a close fight and a well-fought game and season.

### My Week

- It has been a difficult week, filled with a lot of dismay about where our country is going. Very many busy group chats. It felt like I was going through the motions most days.
  
- I promised I would finally get a haircut after the elections. [This debt was claimed the day after](/2022/05/1524008116395724801/).
  
- Ate out at a KFC this week. I haven't been to one in a while. They had these cheesy bacon variants available, so I ordered a cheesy bacon zinger. While eating, I remembered that zingers are spicy and had to ask for additional water.

- The week before the elections, I found a weird bump on the back of my neck and was worried it might be a tumor of some sort. I asked a Doctor friend I met up with to take a look and she said it might be a sebaceous cyst and that I should see a surgeon. Before I got a chance, this past weekend it "popped" and it turned out to be a "pigsa" (boil), so we just ended up draining it every morning and now it's gotten a lot smaller and is a lot less painful. I guess I'm not dying yet.

- On the bright side, with the new bodily problem to worry about, I found myself not noticing that my ankle seems to have fully recovered. Am back to taking more regular walks, something I can hopefully ramp up some more in the coming weeks.

- **Gaming**:
    - I finally completed **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam) last Thursday!! Blog post/review sometime this week probably.
    - [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame): New set dropped this week, but I haven't seen too many new decks in ranked yet.
    - [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena): Continued drafting Streets of New Capenna this week. You can follow along via the [MTGSNC tag](/tags/mtgsnc). I also [did two runs at this weekend's Limited Open](/2022/05/1525721938340876288/) but sadly did not make day 2. Someday!
    - [Street Fighter V](/tags/street-fighter-v): [Managed to hit Super Silver this past week](/2022/05/1524382403296333824/)!
    - I still have not started a new single-player game yet!

### Media Diet

Watched a couple of movies this week, mostly as a way of coping.

- #### John Wick 3: Parabellum (2019)

    - I kind of just wanted a low-thinking movie after the election results came out, and this was just the ticket. It is indeed a very John Wick movie. Action-packed from start to finish. Halle Berry had a smaller role than I thought she would have. I was however disappointed that John Wick actually lost at the end; I would have loved a happy ending after all the IRL disappointments.

- #### Swiss Army Man (2016)

    - Wasn't sure what to expect going into this one. I watched this mostly because I couldn't yet watch the Daniels' latest film **Everything, Everywhere All At Once**, and I heard their first film (this one) was good too. This was a beautifully absurd exploration of life and loneliness with perhaps way too much flatulence. It's best to go into this not knowing much at all.

I also started catching up on Legends of Tomorrow, since they're already cancelled. I have one more episode remaining!

- **Ongoing TV Status:** 
    - Caught up: **NCIS**
    - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **The Simpsons**, **Superman and Lois**, **The Flash season 8**, **Young Justice**
    - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**, 


### This coming week:

- PH Elections tomorrow!
- Limited open next weekend on Arena: Another chance to do horribly!
