title: Adjust Your Relatives' Algorithms
---

If you have less tech-savvy older relatives who are victims of the regime's disinformation machine:

1. Acquire their YT/FB login/password (create an excuse, borrow their phone and reset the password or create a new account)

2. Login to the YT/FB account on another device.

3. Watch/like anti-fake news videos, mainstream media videos and block fake news pages/channels using their account. Repeat often.

4. Occasionally bring up talking points to see if their views are changing.
