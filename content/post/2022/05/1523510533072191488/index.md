<time id="1523510616110944256">[11:50]</time> #Halalan2022 Pro-tip: If you have not yet gone to vote, you can search Twitter for your voting location ("Sth Sth elementary school") to see if people have reported how long the queues are, vcm problems etc

<time id="1523564729469337600">[15:25]</time> Vote has been cast at Tandang Sora Elementary School. Around 20 mins once we found the room

<time id="1523572494384345088">[15:56]</time> Still so many people though. Social distancing impossible. Think vcns in other precincts at same site had problems as someone was on a loudspeaker telling voters to wait or leave their ballots for batch feeding.

<time id="1523572844096987136">[15:57]</time> Our room was on the 2nd floor; my seniors were able to handle it but what abt PWDs? Still, happy we were able to vote quickly, though as usual the elem school seats could only accomodate one of of the butts lol

<time id="1523573118932901889">[15:58]</time> Good luck to everyone still trying to vote today and I hope we all pass today's collective IQ test! #Halalan2022
