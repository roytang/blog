It has been a sad week for the world, something that happens perhaps way too often in the past few years.

### The World

- PH: Congress, sitting as the National Board of Canvassers, has proclaimed Bongbong Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte as the winners of the 2022 presidential and vice-presidential elections. Some reactions from one of my group chats:

    {{< img src="sad.jpg" >}}

    Of course, not everybody is sad. Presumably, his supporters are happy he won, though I've found little evidence of that online. It's more like they're happy Leni lost than BBM winning, and are a bit incensed that she's happily ignoring the noise and enjoying her vacation.

- USA: [Another mass shooting happened in the US this past week](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robb_Elementary_School_shooting), which isn't really news, since that happens all the time, in fact, [one happened just two weeks ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Buffalo_shooting), motivated by racism. This new one seems to have struck a stronger chord because (a) it was a school shooting; and (b) cops were apparently on-site, but did nothing while the shooter killed off a bunch of kids; in fact, they appear to have focused their efforts on stopping parents from intervening as well. As usual, US politicians are wringing their hands but it seems likely no significant changes will happen, or maybe [they'll focus on door control over gun control](https://www.thewrap.com/seth-meyers-ted-cruz-door-control-shootings-gun-control/). The USA is the only country in the world where this sort of thing happens on a regular basis; so much so that Wikipedia has [an entire category named "Mass shootings in the United States"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mass_shootings_in_the_United_States), and there are so many entires it requires pagination!

Today's links are mostly related to the sad news this week, with a bit of LOTR thrown in as a palette cleanser.

### My Week

- Friday morning: I accompanied my parents to get their 2nd covid booster at World Citi Medical Center. Supposedly only people in categories A1 (medical personnel) and A2 (seniors) are already allowed to get the 2nd booster, but when my dad asked if I could get one too, they agreed, so yay? I ended up getting Pfizer for my second booster (parents got Moderna), putting me one step closer to my goal of [getting every covid vaccine into my system](/2022/05/1530046129353543680/).

- Friday afternoon: I hadn't felt any side effects from the vaccine yet, so I go out for my usual afternoon walk plus a bunch of errands. Additional groceries, meds for the folks, picking up some stuff I had dropped off for repair, that kind of thing. Walked a lot more than I expected while carrying a heavy bag and I was dead tired by the end of it, ended up sleeping early.

- Saturday morning: Woke up with a fever, once again the only one in the household to experience vaccine side effects other than the arm soreness. I guess this is what I get for tiring my body out last night. Spend most of the day resting and trying to get my temp down; the fever thankfully subsides in the early evening.

- My Fitbit continues to be on the fritz and now the display won't even work and the tracker won't restart through the usual methods and not even when I drain the battery. Data is still being synced to the app though, so it's still functional. It's a bit weird because when I'm out walking I have to sync to my phone to see the step counts. Forum posts with the same issue suggest no solution other than getting a new one. The tracker has served me well for the past 5 years or so, but I might explore other brands for the next one.

- This week I did some backend work on this site, adding some odd new features here and there. [Perpetually under renovation](/2019/08/perpetually-under-renovation/), as it were. Some of it were ideas I cribbed from other blogs. Maybe someday I'll get around to documenting some of the new things.

- **Gaming**:
    - I am about 35 hours in to **Triangle Strategy** on Switch. I had started the game in hard mode, so I spent a bit too much time trying and failing at a couple of of the battles. No regrets though! The rest of the battles have been of reasonably good quality.
    - [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame): Did terribly at the Throne open this weekend. Mostly aligns with my expectations, since I picked up a deck mere days before the event and the Throne meta is much wider than Expedition and thus much harder to prepare for.
    - [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena): Streamed my final SNC draft last Thursday. You can view [the whole playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXjh3chA9eZ0xgg3O8mwPDTj). There's some kind of Alchemy SNC draft that's going to be available later this week, I might try that and stream it as well. There was also another Qualifier Play-In event this weekend, but I skipped it since my gem count is a bit low again.
    - [Street Fighter V](/tags/street-fighter-v): Still playing occasionally; struggling to stay/get back into Super Silver.
    - PC game pass is now officially available in our country; I have been eyeing the games list, and there's quite a few there I'm interested in trying out. Of course, the problem is I still have a near-infinite backlog over on Steam!

### Media Diet

- #### Everything Everywhere All At Once

    - Finally got to watch this one. It's Michelle Yeoh's multiverse of madness! I was already a bit overhyped about this movie because of a lot of people talking about how good it was. Luckily, it was indeed very good and I found myself laughing out loud multiple times at the absurdity of events in the film. At the same time I find it hard to talk about it without spoiling anything. Alongside the concepts of probability and randomness that being a multiverse movie requires, it manages to touch on a whole gamut of topics from traditional Asian values to parent-child relationships to existential nihilism to the difficulties immigrants face and so on. 

- #### Uncharted

    - Came in for a generic action film with maybe some light video game flavor, got exactly that. The film isn't exceptional, and I still have trouble accepting Tom Holland as a grownup, but it does a serviceable job replicating the exploration and treasure hunting and puzzle solving feel of the Uncharted games, minus the "Nathan Drake kills 200 mercenaries in his sleep" part. I was amazed at their technology that allowed an app to track another person's location and communicate even through underground tunnels and caves.

- Started reading: **A Psalm for the Wild-Built** by Becky Chambers

- **Ongoing TV Status:** 
    - Caught up: **NCIS**, **The Flash season 8**, **The Simpsons**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds**
    - Behind: **Superman and Lois**, , **Young Justice**
    - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**, 


### This coming week:

Oh wow, it's going to be June! There's new Alchemy drops on Arena to look forward to I guess?
