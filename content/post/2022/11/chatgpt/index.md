OpenAI recently released a new text AI chatbot, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). I've been [playing around with it a bit since yesterday](/2022/12/1598559150187110400/) and I am generally impressed with the progress in this area.

Instead of just writing a straight-up blog post about it, I thought it would be appropriate to try to let the bot write about itself! I fed it this prompt:

> Write a blog post about ChatGPT, in the writing style of Roy Tang, who blogs at https://roytang.net/blog
>

And here's what I got back:

> Hello everyone!
> 
> Today I want to talk to you about ChatGPT, a new natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. For those of you who may not be familiar, NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling machines to understand and generate human language.
> 
> ChatGPT is a variant of GPT-3, which is one of the largest and most powerful language models ever created. GPT-3 was trained on a massive amount of text data, allowing it to generate human-like responses to a wide range of inputs. ChatGPT builds on this foundation, but with a focus on conversational language.
> 
> One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate responses that are appropriate for the context of the conversation. For example, if you were to ask it about the weather, it would be able to generate a response that is relevant to the current weather conditions, rather than providing a generic response.
> 
> Another impressive aspect of ChatGPT is its ability to remember past interactions and use that information to inform its responses. This means that it is able to maintain a coherent conversation, even over a long period of time.
> 
> One potential use case for ChatGPT is as a customer service chatbot. Imagine being able to have a natural, human-like conversation with a chatbot that is able to provide accurate and helpful information. This could greatly improve the customer experience, and reduce the workload on human customer service representatives.
> 
> Overall, ChatGPT is a fascinating development in the world of NLP and AI. As natural language processing technology continues to advance, we may see more and more impressive applications of this technology in the future.
> 
> That's all for now, folks. Until next time!
>

First of all, that is nowhere near what I sound like, which makes me assume my blog was not part of the corpus of training data for this bot (understandable). Secondly, this reads more like a puff piece than anything else. Let's see some downsides!

Prompt:

> What are the dangers of ChatGPT?

Response:

> One of the potential dangers of ChatGPT is the possibility of creating false or misleading information. Because the chatbot relies on machine learning algorithms, it may not always provide accurate or reliable information. This could lead to confusion or misinformation being spread through the platform.
> 
> Another danger is the potential for the chatbot to be used for malicious purposes. For example, a user could use ChatGPT to create fake profiles or impersonate others in order to spread spam or malicious content.
> 
> Additionally, there is the potential for the chatbot to be used to invade users' privacy. If the chatbot collects personal information from users without their consent, it could potentially be used for nefarious purposes.
> 
> Overall, it's important for users to be aware of the potential risks and take steps to protect themselves when using ChatGPT. This may include being cautious about the information they share with the chatbot, and using the platform with a critical eye to verify the accuracy of the information provided.

Prompt:

> Are people in danger of losing their jobs because of things like ChatGPT

Response:

> There is a potential risk that the use of chatbots like ChatGPT could lead to job losses in certain industries. For example, if a customer service chatbot is able to handle a large portion of customer inquiries and concerns, it could potentially lead to reduced staffing needs in that area.
> 
> Additionally, the use of chatbots in other industries, such as finance or healthcare, could potentially lead to job losses as tasks that were previously performed by human workers are automated.
> 
> However, it's important to note that the impact of chatbots on job losses is not yet clear, and it may vary depending on the industry and the specific tasks being automated. Some experts argue that the use of chatbots could actually lead to the creation of new jobs, as companies may need to hire workers to manage and maintain the chatbot technology.
> 
> Overall, the potential impact of chatbots on job losses is an important issue to consider, and it will be important for businesses and workers to carefully assess the potential risks and benefits of using chatbot technology.

At least the bot is aware of these things!

One other thing I'd like to note is: I promise never to use AI-based tools to write my blog posts without explicitly saying I have (as I've done here). This seems like something good for bloggers or writers to declare!

Lots of people on Twitter are talking about ChatGPT and sharing their prompts and outputs, here are some I liked:

- [Bram Cohen pointing out the bot's flaws](https://twitter.com/bramcohen/status/1598889506404732933)

There's actually been many more that came across my feed but I didn't get links to everything!

Overall, despite some flaws, very promising development in AI content generation, and maybe a sad indicator of how much nonsense boilerplate fluff we have in modern writing. Looking forward to where this all takes us!
