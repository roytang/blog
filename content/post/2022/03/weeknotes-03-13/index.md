### A Quote

> "This is a hard mindset to get out of, that the world is best if it prioritizes only your priorities. I promise though that the moment you open yourself up to the idea that a diverse world creates an overall better world because it allows each person to find their own passions, and a world of happy people will create a better overall world for you because that positivity will lead to things that will make you happier (and as a nice side effect, other people are happier)."

### The World

- Ukraine is now suffering the 3rd week of Putin's invasion. The rest of the world suffers high oil prices and the anxiety over possible escalation. 
- PH/Covid: This week marked the 2nd anniversary of the first covid lockdowns in the country. We are in pretty good shape at the moment, cases are very low, and there is even talk of potentially dropping to the not-yet-planned "Alert Level 0",
  
### Links of Interest

- Joel Dueck writes about [the Unbearable Lightness of Web Pages](https://thelocalyarn.com/excursus/secretary/posts/web-books.html)
- [TIL: Autofocus inputs are an accessibility problem](https://medium.com/@gavyn/til-autofocus-inputs-are-an-accessibility-problem-32ced60c3109) by Gavyn McKenzie. (Warning: Medium) I found this interesting only because when I started out in web dev, our company's standard test plan required that we autofocus the first editable control on page load. When I shared this on Twitter, some of the testers I worked with crawled out of the woodwork [with some comments.](/2022/03/b6a10da46de8ca5c99aca4ef2c6e288b/)

Not a lot today. Visit the [Links page](/links/) for more links of interest.

### My Week

- Yet another difficult week sleep-wise. I find myself once again [out of sync with the world](/2019/08/out-of-sync-with-the-world/) and unable to establish a regular rhythm.
- The week did end up a bit productive with respect to some personal projects, including [the backend code that runs this site](/2021/11/cypress/). Maybe someday I'll even talk about it.
- Past couple of days have been scorching hot; truly the days of cool weather are behind us. I suspect we are in for a truly terrible summer, with high energy prices and strains on the power and water systems that service the Metro.
- Finally managed to have a good phone call with Globe's customer service, and I am assured that the unwanted charges I have been struggling to reverse will be removed in the next, next bill (since we didn't make the cutoff for the next bill). Still, they have lied (or misled) me before, so I remain cautiously optimistic.
- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: 
        - **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam): Second run still ongoing.
        - **Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair**, now only the Impossible Lair remains, and it is way harder than I thought it would be, truly living up to it's name! I am currently 13 or 14 attempts in, at a mere 63% of the stage, so this might take a while! (I am actually already a little tempted to just give up on the game already, but I am so close to completion!)
        - Saturday regular gaming has been playing more [Blood Rage](/2021/03/blood-rage/) and yesterday I found out I am currently [#3 on the game's worldwide leaderboard](/2022/03/1502713188105654274/)! Not a lot of people playing this game I reckon!
    - Ongoing Card games: 
        - Winding down on [Neon Dynasty limited](/tags/mtgneo) on [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/) since quick drafts are ending. Am planning to publish a post detailing my season stats, probably tomorrow.
        - [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) grinding continues.
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Still playing the occasional **Street Fighter V** match, few and far between. Though I did manage to steal a win off a much higher-level Nash the other day; the rank difference was so large I ended up ahead on league points even though he won two out of three matches! I did get bodied a lot by Zangief this past week though. [Russian bullies!](/2022/03/1501892239617785859/)
- **Watching**:
    - Movies: No new movies watched this week, though I did manage to write some words about [The Batman (2021)](/2022/03/the-batman/).
    - **TV:** 
        - Caught up: **Superman and Lois**, **Star Trek Discovery**, **Star Trek Picard season 2**, **NCIS**
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**
- **Reading**: Almost done with **The Last Continent by Terry Pratchett**.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions, sometimes we record and upload to [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). (some Filipino slips in here and there, but most of it should be in English.) Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- I have nothing queued up in my notes at the moment. What are you looking forward to this week?
