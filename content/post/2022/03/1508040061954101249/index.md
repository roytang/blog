title: Alchemy Metagame challenge
---

I did a bunch of runs at the #MagicArena Alchemy Metagame challenge this weekend, but the 7-win run remained elusive. Overall I ended up down 3500 gold but also up 35 packs, so that's not too bad a rate, but still a sweep would have been nice. 

| attempt# | wins | gold | packs |
|---|---|---|---|
| Rakdos |
| 1 | 4 | +500 | +5 |
| 2 | 1 | -1000 |
| 3 | 1 | -1000 |
| 4 | 5 | +1000 | +10 |
| 5 | 1 | -1000 |
| 6 | 1 | -1000 |
| Runes |
| 7 | 0 | -1500 |
| 8 | 1 | -1000 |
| 9 | 6 | +2000 | +20 |

<time>[19:15]</time> I ran two decks recommended by [@urlichmtg](https://twitter.com/urlichmtg/) , with slight tweaks. The RB deck was pretty sweet, but as the weekend went on, the grindy mirror match became more and more common so I switched to Runes.

Two decks I'll be using at the Metagame Challenge + starting guides to them:



- RB Value based on [@crokeyz](https://twitter.com/crokeyz/)'s list, good for the wide meta.



- Naya Runes, good to counter RB Value. 



Remember, it's an 'all-access' event, which means you don't need cards to play!

<time>[19:15]</time> Having the event be All-Access was great and means anyone can give Alchemy a try for a reasonably low entry fee. I'm probably done with it already (NINE RUNS is already a lot), but it should be running for at least another 24h I think.
