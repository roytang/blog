title: The Batman (2022)

Watched The Batman (2022) yesterday, only my second time in the cinemas since the pandemic began. 

Spoiler-free review:

- a different, darker and more grounded take on the Batman mythology compared to previous films. This one is more of neo-noir mystery and has a stronger focus on Batman's investigative abilities.
- Pattinson's Batman is younger and earlier in his career, still brash and reckless and unrefined and full of rage and vengeance, but he manages to find a bit of growth during the course of the narrative. I really like the Batman costume in this film, especially the whole raised collar thing and the weight with which he walks into a scene. The Batmobile is great too.
- some great performances; Pattinson was okay. Jeffrey Wright did a good job as Gordon, though he seemed to be playing the same kind of character as he did in the James Bond franchise. Dano was pretty good even though he had very little face time, his few scenes really sold how insane and delusional his character was. Kravitz was ok, perhaps a bit uneven. Even the more minor players gave good performances; Farrel was great (and unrecognizable!), Torturro made a menacing Falcone, etc. Andy Serkis didn't actually have a lot to do, but he was okay.
- probably one of the best DCEU films visually, there are certain scenes that were obviously set up to be really great shots
- there is no post-credits scene, though there is a bit of easter egg/stinger at the end which probably isn't worth it for most people
- while the credits or rolling my brother and I were debating whether this one was better overall than [The Dark Knight (2008)](/2008/07/movies-the-dark-knight/). It's definitely super close, both were very good films and each of them had a different approach and emphasized different aspects of the character and the villains, but we both put The Dark Knight still narrowly ahead. 
- I probably ended up enjoying this one more than [Spider-Man No Way Home (2022)](/2022/02/spider-man-no-way-home/) simply because this one wasn't relying on big gimmicks that are easily ruined by spoilers.
- The film had exactly one spoilerable easter egg and actually the internet still managed to spoil it for me less than a week into the film's release, but it had very little impact so I guess that's fine.

Some things I really liked:

- that Batmobile chase with the Penguin was fantastic. Shaky and chaotic and hard to follow, like an actual car chase would be for the participants, yet still portraying the Batmobile as a relentless pursuer perhaps straight out of hell
- missing the whole "You Are El" clue was indeed kind of dumb though, but at least it got Penguin to drop the "World's Greatest Detective" phrase, although Batman isn't there yet.
- the crudeness of his tools and methods emphasizes how new this Batman is; he hasn't yet gotten a hang of gliding off rooftops for example (unlike Nolan's Batman who almost immediately turned his cape into some magic gliding material). Even in combat he has a ways to go; during melee he takes a lot of hits and even took a shotgun blast point blank at some point.
- hallway fight scene lit only by gunfire
- this Batman still hasn't created a separate persona for Bruce Wayne yet; Wayne here is a recluse, rarely seen in public. And even when he is in public as Bruce Wayne, he walks and talks as seriously as the Batman does.
- that one cop saying the Riddler has "over 500 followers" like that's a lot lol
- at a certain point, it is heavily implied but never said out loud that Riddler might have figured out the Batman's identity as Bruce Wayne and he goes to confront him at Arkham. During their discussion it's obvious that Riddler doesn't know about Bruce Wayne but it also doesn't matter because he knows the truth: that Batman is the real identity.

If you liked the film but haven't read a lot of the comics, here's some stuff you might want to read:

- Batman: Year One (1987) by Frank Miller and David Mazzucchelli
- The Long Halloween (1996) by Jeph Loeb and Tim Sale.
- Batman: The Impostor (2021) by Mattson Tomlin and lettered by Andrea Sorrentino. Tomlin was also an uncredited writer for this film.
