Just like that we are three months into the year. Time marches on.

### A Quote

> “There has to be a balance, Vin,” he said. “Somehow, we’ll find it. The balance between whom we wish to be and whom we need to be.” He sighed. “But for now,” he said, nodding to the side, “we simply have to be satisfied with who we are.”

> - from The Hero of Ages by Brandon Sanderson

### The World

- Putin's invasion of Russia continues, extending past 10 days. Russia is heavily hit by sanctions, which Putin [says is tantamount to a declaration of war](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/05/russia-ukraine-war-news-live-updates/).
- PH: As of March 1, Metro Manila has been dropped to the lowest alert level.

### My Week

- I had a not-very-good week. Some annoying things nagging at me, making it difficult to be productive. It's also made it difficult to write more often on the blog.
- One of the things stressing me out is that I have another ongoing issue with my internet provider Globe Telecom; it's in the second month now and I'm hoping I can resolve it soon. If not, I may need to write about it publicly.
- Last Wednesday was Ash Wednesday. We still haven't actually gotten back into attending real Mass in a church since the pandemic started, but we had some homemade ashes ('blessed' somehow I guess?) and still heard Mass virtually (online).
- Went out to the mall today. Only the second time this year, and third time since the pandemic. With Metro Manila now at the lowest alert level, people are out in droves once again. At least everyone is wearing masks.
- I miss the regular sketching; am thinking of getting back into it in some form (although it's not like I've magically found more time day to day).
- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: 
        - **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam): Second run still ongoing.
        - **Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair**, already in the completion stage! Though I have yet to attempt the Impossible Lair itself
        - Since both of the above games are already in the somewhat chill completion phase, I'm tempted to start a third ongoing single player game.
        - Something I've been waiting to get done for a while: [The "Go outside" achievement of The Stanley Parable!](2022/03/1499290448602435586/)
    - Ongoing Card games: Regular [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/) and [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) games continue. I still plan to stream the occasional [Neon Dynasty](/tags/mtgneo) quick drafts.
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Still playing the occasional **Street Fighter V** match, though I'm finding less and less time for these.
- **Watching**:
    - Movies: Managed to watch a few movies this week: [Drive (2011)](/2022/12/movies-tv-2022/#drive-2011), [Free Guy (2021)](/2022/12/movies-tv-2022/#free-guy-2021) and today I watched **The Batman (2022)**, review to follow.
    - **TV:** 
        - Managed to catch up on some series this week and was also pleasantly surprised that the season 2 of Star Trek Picard had already started on Prime Video.
        - Caught up: **Superman and Lois**, **Star Trek Discovery**, **Star Trek Picard season 2**
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**,  **NCIS**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**
- **Reading**: I read [The Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K. Le Guin](/2022/03/lathe-of-heaven-/). Also picked up a Discworld book I had previously left partway through: **The Last Continent by Terry Pratchett**.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions, you can follow along via [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). (some Filipino slips in here and there, but most of it should be in English.) One of the new games we've tried recently is [Geoguessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- I don't have anything to look forward to (yet).
