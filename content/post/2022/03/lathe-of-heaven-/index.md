title: 'Books: The Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K. Le Guin'
---

I wasn't sure what to read next so I randomly picked **The Lathe of Heaven by Ursula K. Le Guin** to read, going in without knowing what it was about. It was surprisingly really good! I really enjoyed it and I burned through the book in around three sittings, which is a very fast rate for me these days.

The book is about a timid man who is afraid to dream because he discovers that his dreams are able to alter reality, something he does not want to be responsible for. He comes under the care of a dream therapist who discovers the potential of his power and tries to use it to "improve" the world. Things escalate quickly throughout their regular sessions, as you can imagine. 

Le Guin is a masterful writer, communicating changes with such poetry and subtlety, making it easy to draw you in and immerse you in the world. There is a lot of philosophy in the book as well, as the protagonist argues with his therapist over the responsibility to use this power for "good" versus simply letting the world be as it is.

After reading the first few chapters of the book, I took a nap and woke up wondering if my own dreams have affected the world.


Some quotes:

>  “For example,” he said, “I frequently daydream heroics. I am the hero. I’m saving a girl, or a fellow astronaut, or a besieged city, or a whole damn planet. Messiah dreams, do-gooder dreams. Haber saves the world! They’re a hell of a lot of fun—so long as I keep ‘em where they belong. We all need that ego boost we get from daydreams, but when we start relying on it, then our reality-parameters are getting a bit shaky. . . . Then there’s the South Sea Island type daydreams—a lot of middle-aged executives go in for them.  And the noble-suffering-martyr type, and the various romantic fantasies of adolescence, and the sado-masochist daydream, and so on. Most people recognize most types. We’ve almost all been in the arena facing the lions, at least once, or thrown a bomb and destroyed our enemies, or rescued the pneumatic virgin from the sinking ship, or written Beethoven’s Tenth Symphony for him. Which style do you favor?”
> 
> “I don’t know. Things don’t have purposes, as if the universe were a machine, where every part has a useful function. What’s the function of a galaxy? I don’t know if our life has a purpose and I don’t see that it matters. What does matter is that we’re a part. Like a thread in a cloth or a grass-blade in a field. It is and we are. What we do is like wind blowing on the grass.”
> 
> life’s not a static object, after all. It’s a process. There’s no holding still. Intellectually you know that, but emotionally you refuse it. Nothing remains the same from one moment to the next, you can’t step into the same river twice. Life—evolution—the whole universe of space/time, matter/ energy—existence itself—is essentially change.”
> 
> “When things don’t change any longer, that’s the end result of entropy, the heat-death of the universe. The more things go on moving, interrelating, conflicting, changing, the less balance there is—and the more life. I’m pro-life, George. Life itself is a huge gamble against the odds, against all odds! You can’t try to live safely, there’s no such thing as safety. Stick your neck out of your shell, then, and live fully! It’s not how you get there, but where you get to that counts. What you’re afraid to accept, here, is that we’re engaged in a really great experiment, you and I. We’re on the brink of discovering and controlling, for the good of all mankind., a whole new force, an entire new field of antientropic energy, of the life-force, of the will to act, to do, to change!”
