title: Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair
---

Yesterday I finished Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair, a platformer released on Steam in 2019. I started playing this one in mid-February, mostly because I wanted a shorter non-RPG game to play alongside **Tales of Vesperia**, and I had this in the backlog for a while.

Not a big fan of the aesthetic (it's obviously geared more towards kids), but the game itself is fun enough. The game consists of a top-down Zelda-like overworld where you unlock secrets and new chapters, and the chapters themselves are individual 2D platforming stages, in the modern Mario style: you just want to get to the end but there are also extras and secrets to collect and unlock.

The stages remind me the most of the old Donkey Kong Country games on the SNES, which is unsurprising as the dev team was apparently composed of former Rare employees (DKC's developer). I had actually been [looking for this style of platformer on non-Nintendo platforms for a while now](/2015/10/3nbmqa/), so discovering this game in my backlog was a pleasant surprise.

The platforming stages are mostly pretty easy (like I said, geared towards kids), though there are one or two in there that may frustrate you and take quite a few tries. All of the stages however are optional! Each stage you unlock just gives you a "bee", which will help you when you face the final stage by giving you another "hit" you can take. So you can actually skip all of the stages and try to go straight for the epnoymous Impossible Lair!

### The Impossible Lair

Going straight for the Impossible Lair is not a good idea though. I had completed all the stages before going in and wasn't expecting to be too challenged because hey it's a kid game right? The Impossible Lair ended up being surprisingly tough, composed of four boss encounters with very difficult platforming segments in the game. Luckily, the game lets you start over from just before each boss encounter, retaining the number of bees you had the previous time you got to that boss. (So you need to manage your bee count to make sure you still have enough for the rest of the fight.) Even then it was very difficult!

The middle parts (boss fight 2 and 3, and the platforming segments in between) were the most difficult, and I ended up repeating those segments the most because I wanted to have enough bees for the final part. I was stuck at 68% for the longest time but last Sunday I sat down and powered through that middle segment and got to boss fight 3 with 24 bees left, which should be enough for 50% of the Impossible Lair! I would have been happy with that progress already for the day but of course kept going to see how far I could go, and it turned out that I was able to finish the level in that same run!

The version of that stage that I finished was actually the "Not-So-Impossible Lair" version which had the checkpoints and the extra hits from the rescued bees. You have the option of running the **true** Impossible Lair where you get no checkpoints and no extra armor. I tried this one time and only got 7% in lol. It's the kind of thing that requires speedrunner-levels of obsession so I'm out. Luckily finishing this version is **not** required for achievement completion!

### Completion

{{% img src="cheevos.png" %}}

The game's completion is pretty straightforward - finish all the stages, collect and unlock all the collectibles, then finish the Impossible Lair at least once. There's a bit of a grind after finishing all the stages because you need to collect some currency to buy all the overworld collectibles (Tonics), but it wasn't too bad of a slog. I left the Impossible Lair for last and it took me two weeks after competing everything else to actually beat the Impossible Lair!

### Overall

Looks like I got this game from the Humble Choice bundle back in September 2020, so it was a little over a year and a half before I played it. Total playtime: 28.1 hours. Not too shabby for a bundle purchase! The game is pretty good, if you don't mind the kiddie aesthetic! Hopefully we get more platformers like this on Steam!
