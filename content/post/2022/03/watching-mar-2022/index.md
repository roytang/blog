I keep shifting between writing individual posts per thing I want to review or doing one of these ["Watching Lately"](/tags/watching-lately/) posts that consolidate several items at the same time. I guess when it's a number of "less important" films or shows it's okay to consolidate them together? But if it's something like [The Batman](/2022/03/the-batman/) or an [MCU](/tags/mcu/) film which are generally bigger fandoms for me, then individual posts are ok, since I'll usually have a lot to say? IDK, I'm just making this all up as I go along.

This one is the last two weeks worth of movies and a bit of tv.

### Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (2011)

Been meaning to watch this for a while. Very classic cold war spy stuff. Some excellent performances. Surprised to see so many familiar actors, I only knew about Oldman being here. The film is one of those were each shot lingers a lot and there's a lot of staring and thinking and mood-setting, but at the same the plot moves relatively quickly and needs a lot of attention so if you're watching it on background, you're likely to miss out on some plot details. Basically the kind of thing I wouldn't want to sit through with my parents because they'd keep asking me questions.

### The Adam Project (2022)

{{< photos adam >}}

Some people kind of overhyped this to me. Not as good as [the last Reynolds film I watched](/2022/12/movies-tv-2022/#free-guy-2021), but ok enough for a popcorn movie. Reynolds still basically playing himself. Plot is a bit predictable, and not a fan of how their time travel works.

### Star Trek Discovery season 4

Unlike Star Trek Picard which is running mostly on nostalgia, Discovery season 4 pushes Star Trek into never before explored space - first contact outside the galaxy! Despite the fact that literally billions of lives were snuffed out this season, they still went for the feel good ending and even managed to cameo a US politician at the end. Not a spectacular season, but it's worth the watch.

### Lucy (2014)

Not a fan of this one, probably my least favorite by Luc Besson. Plot is nonsensical and while ScarJo's protagonist was thrust into an unfortunate situation, it's hard to empathize with her when she's just staring blankly into space for two-thirds of the movie. The action scenes aren't even good enough to compensate for the nonsense plot.

### Pokemon Detective Pikachu (2019)

I thought I might like this one since it's a videogame film, but I'm not really into Pokemon so it was a bit harder for me to appreciate (and I'm not the type to go awww at the cute CGI pokemon either). It's the typical film where the protag has to unravel a mystery that unsurprisingly has a rich white man behind it all along.

### Oblivion (2013)

Randomly chose this one because Netflix said it was trending #5 in the country or such. Had low expectations, was pleasantly surprised. A decent sci-fi film with a twist you could probably guess coming a mile away. Decent performance by Cruise, and Olga Kurylenko was pleasant surprise. Jamie Lannister is also here! Visuals were pretty good too.
