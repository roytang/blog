March is almost done. The summer heat is undeniably here. I am so very tired.

### A Quote

> "A single grain of rice can tip the scale. One man may be the difference between victory and defeat." - from "Mulan" 

(A reminder I need when I feel bad about the current state of the world and PH politics and feel like there's nothing I can do.)

### The World

- Putin's invasion of Ukraine is now in its 5th week. Ukranians are fighting back from Kyiv, and Russia has refocused it's effort around the Donbas region, claiming that was the plan all along. 
- PH/Politics: I was surprised to hear some fireworks going off the other night, but apparently it was because the campaign period for local seats had started this weekend. At least incumbent mayor Joy Belmonte seems favored to win over Ivermectin promoter and Unithieves ally Mike Defensor.
- PH/Covid: Our cases remain low. Not much Covid news on our end actually. Hopefully the local campaign period doesn't spike the cases.

### My Week

- This week felt busy. It was a mix of medical and family errands, some favors for other people, and weekend gaming events that took up a lot of my time.
- [The nearby Santuario supports #LeniKiko2022](/2022/03/santuario-leni-kiko/#_) (Click through for more photos):

- **Gaming**:
    - Wrote about [Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair](/2022/03/impossible-lair/)
    - Ongoing: 
        - **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam): Second run still ongoing slowly but surely; I'm currently late enough into the game that some of the post-game stuff can already be started, so I'm getting into it. Might be a month before I can finish this though, which implies that a JRPG takes me 4 calendar months to finish!
    - Card games: 
        - The card games made my weekend busy!
        - [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/) had the all-access Alchemy Metagame challenge. I [did NINE RUNS](/2022/03/1508040061954101249/), but the sweep was elusive.
            - I also [wrote a nontrivial amount of words](/2022/03/i1k2qwn/) in reply to a reddit thread about the community meme-ing on the recent "Technology" response in the Arena economy stream. (This is a pretty deep cut for anyone who isn't into Arena drama)
        - [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) had their Expedition Open this weekend. I was hoping to earn some cash in this event, but my two runs did not get there, but as usual the pack rewards were generous so that's nice. I actually wanted to play more runs but found out there was a limit of 2 runs. Oh well. Next month has a draft open I believe, so I might practice that next month! (I also [managed to hit Master rank early this month!](/2022/03/1506571054759636995/))
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Still only the occasional **Street Fighter V** match, and having trouble rising above silver.
    - The past couple of years, I got two big bundles of itch.io games but haven't had time to dig through them. I decided to correct that by [streaming some of them](/2022/03/1506598089993474049/). I plan to do this once a week maybe, so I'll probably need a hashtag or such.
- **Watching**:
    - There've been a bunch, so I [wrote some words about recent movies/TV I've seen](/2022/03/watching-mar-2022/).
    - **TV:** 
        - Caught up: **NCIS**, **The Simpsons**
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**, **Superman and Lois**, **Star Trek Picard season 2**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**
- **Reading**: Still reading **Wyrd Sisters** by Terry Pratchett. The book isn't long, I've just been unable to read.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions, but we haven't uploaded any new videos in a while. You can still watch the old sessions on [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- [The 50th Ludum Dare Game Jam](https://ldjam.com/) is next weekend! I missed the last one due to covid so I am looking forward to this one.
- Moon Knight drops on Disney+ on Wednesday!
