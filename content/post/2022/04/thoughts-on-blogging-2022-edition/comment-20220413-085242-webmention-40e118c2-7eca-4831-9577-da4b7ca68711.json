The game site is nostalgia for me and contains a lot of custom stuff to auto-pull data from e.g. <a href=\"http://howlongtobeat.com\">howlongtobeat.com</a>. I connected both sites using webmentions but still ask myself whether or not to write more about games on Brain Baking instead. <br /><br />Your thoughts?
