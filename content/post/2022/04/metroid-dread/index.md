I finished Metroid Dread today! The game came out for Nintendo Switch last October and my brother lent me his copy last month. This was only my second time finishing an actual Metroid game; the first one was the original Metroid all the way back on the NES! 

I loved the game, I devoured it in a bit over three weeks (which is a very quick pace for me already). It is an excellent side-scrolling Metroidvania (as you'd expect) and has a great gameplay loop where every time you beat a boss you unlock a new ability and you want to use the new ability to go back and explore and access things you couldn't access before and chase down these secrets and then suddenly oops you're at another boss again and it's past midnight and you're having trouble beating him and you should probably continue this tomorrow. (Luckily the Switch has a sleep mode!)

The bosses were very challenging, especially the earlier ones where you don't have a lot of abilities or mobility yet. I died many many times. There are a lot of abilities and weapons to discover and unlock, and each one usually adds some mobility options or helps you bypass environment obstacles especially to reach powerups that were previously tantalizingly out of reach.

The game features these EMMIs, basically invincible hunter robots that patrol certain areas of the map; they can hear you move and will hunt you down and it's usually instant death if they catch you. The only way to kill them is to find the control center in the area they patrol that provides you with an Omega Beam that can weaken and eventually kill the EMMI. Walking into an EMMI area is usually very intense. It adds an interesting element of stealth to the game as early on you have to try to sneak through the EMMI areas and avoid detection until you can find the control center to kill them.

I did manage 100% item completion here, though I had to use a guide to use the last few items. The game does provide the hero Samus with an ability to detect "hidden" objects that can unlock hidden areas, but you'd have to go through each room to use it and that seemed tedious so I wasn't up for that. There were also some items that needed you to figure out how to use the Shinespark ability effectively, those were very annoying as some of them require some fairly precise platforming, but I managed somehow.

Overall very happy with the game, well worth my time!
