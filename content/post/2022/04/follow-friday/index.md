I think more people should blog, and more people should follow people who blog, so I've been meaning to do some posts to promote other people's blogs, in the hopes of accelerating the return of real/personal blogs. (As opposed to those commercial blogs that are just for selling stuff or being content farms or whatever.)

With that in mind, here are some blogs I can recommend you follow:

### Pluralistic by Cory Doctorow

Cory Doctorow has been blogging for a while; he used to blog over on BoingBoing (as mentioned in [my Blogs of Yesteryear post](/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/)), but now he has his own blog up on [Pluralistic.net](https://pluralistic.net/). He still covers most of the same topics he covered over on the old blog: technology, futurism, capitalism, generally left-wing stuff. He posts daily and each post covers one or more topics, with at least one of those topics being well-research, covered with some depth and linking to various sources.

Two notable things are this blog are:

- no trackers, no ads, no statistics are collected, on principle.
- he follows the POSSE (post on-site, share/syndicate everywhere) philosophy. I first heard of this [from the Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). Pluralistic's post live on his own domain with a permanent URL, but are also shared out to various platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, Medium, and Tumblr. This by itself is not unusual. My own blog posts are syndicated to twitter and mastodon, but I only share the link to the post (and some image attachments if applicable), because that's easily automatable. But Doctorow shares the entire contents of his posts as threads on both Twitter and Mastodon, which is an insane amount of manual work to be doing for a daily blog. He has some scripts to assist him, but because many of our modern platforms are averse to open integration, it feels like a lot of that still happen manually. He talks about this process a bit [here](https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/19/now-we-are-two/#two-much-posse) and in more detail [here](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd). I just have to admire that kind of dedication to blogging.

Pluralistic is only two years old, and I think I've been following it since shortly after it started. Not all of his posts are of interest to me, but when I do decide to dig in to one of his posts, I always find myself learning a lot. I've already linked to his blog quite a bit. Here are [my posts that link to Pluralistic](/domains/pluralistic.net/). The most recent one was [a post about modern computer security problems](https://pluralistic.net/2022/01/30/ring-minus-one/).

### Dan Luu

I believe [Dan Luu](https://twitter.com/danluu) works at Twitter on performance stuff. His [blog](https://danluu.com/) is very minimalistic but his posts are chock-full of content. He writes often about programming, technology, productivity, and similar topics. He's not as prolific as Doctorow - I think he has like 2-4 posts a month on average but each post will be quite long and he will tend to attack a topic from different angles for a more thorough analysis.

Like Pluralistic, I've [linked to his articles a number of times](/domains/danluu.com/). The most recent one I've shared was [this essay about the difficulties in identifying talent](https://danluu.com/talent/).

### The Rubesletters by Matt Ruby

Matt Ruby is surprisingly, a stand-up comedian. His [blog is a substack](https://mattruby.substack.com/) and he covers topics like tech, creativity, mindfulness, and such. Each post will usually have one long essay with nuanced takes on a particular topic, and a number of shorter bits and shared links in the second half of the post. I'm not particularly big on his stand-up act ([it's okay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VAIjE35LA)), but I appreciate that he brings a comic's POV to everyday and tech topics. He usually posts once a week.

Here are [my posts that link to his substack](/domains/mattruby.substack.com/). The most recent one I've shared was this [great rant about our modern tech dystopia](https://mattruby.substack.com/p/time-spent-on-app-and-what-its-doing). 

### Winnie Lim

While the above blogs mostly cover topics of public interest, this one is more of a real personal blog; it documents the writer's own life and is an outlet for her thoughts and reflections.

[Winnie Lim](https://winnielim.org/) writes about topics such as [journaling](https://winnielim.org/journal/making-space-for-my-self-through-journalling/) / [writing](https://winnielim.org/journal/writing-as-a-practice/), [anxiety](https://winnielim.org/journal/time-to-be-while-being-anxious-about-time/), [note-taking](https://winnielim.org/journal/the-long-view-note-taking-and-becoming-a-person/), [dealing with health issues](https://winnielim.org/journal/the-isolating-experience-of-my-migraines/). Her posts are often wistful and they explore her own feelings and are full of philosophical reflections and quotes.

I've been following her for a few months, but I don't share her posts, mostly because that's not often the kind of articles I like to share. I do enjoy reading her blog though. It's a bit weird to be saying you enjoy reading someone's personal thoughts about her own life on the internet (as opposed to general-topic blogs like the above entries). But in the same way that I believe writing about one's own personal thoughts serves to improve one's self-awareness and clarify your thoughts, I think reading about other people's personal lives serves to improve our sense of empathy and understanding of other people.

Two of the above recommendations are already on my [public blogroll](/page/blogroll/), which has been in dire need of updating for a while now. I think I want to do one of these Follow Friday posts once a month maybe? We'll see how it goes.
