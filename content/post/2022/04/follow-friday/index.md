I think more people should blog, and more people should follow people who blog, so I've been meaning to do some posts to promote other people's blogs, in the hopes of accelerating the return of real/personal blogs. (And not any of those commercial blogs that are just for selling stuff or being content farms or whatever.)

With that in mind, here are some blogs I can recommend you follow:

### Pluralistic by Cory Doctorow

Cory Doctorow has been blogging for a while; he used to blog over on BoingBoing (as mentioned in [my Blogs of Yesteryear post](/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/)), but now he has his own blog up on [Pluralistic.net](https://pluralistic.net/). He still covers most of the same topics he covered over on the old blog: technology, futurism, capitalism, generally left-wing stuff. He posts daily and each post covers one or more topics, with at least one of those topics being well-research, covered with some depth and linking to various sources.

Two notable things are this blog are:

- no trackers, no ads, on statistics are collected, on principle.
- he follows the POSSE (post on-site, share/syndicate everywhere) philosophy. I first heard of this [from the Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). Pluralistic's post live on his own domain with a permanent URL, but are also shared out to various platforms like Twitter, Mastodon, Medium, and Tumblr. This by itself is not unusual. My own blog posts are syndicated to twitter and mastodon, but I only share the link to the post (and some image attachments if applicable), because that's easily automatable. But Doctorow shares the entire contents of his posts as threads on both Twitter and Mastodon, which is an insane amount of manual work to be doing for a daily blog. He has some scripts to assist him, but because many of our modern platforms are averse to open integration, it feels like a lot of that still happen manually. He talks about this process a bit [here](https://pluralistic.net/2022/02/19/now-we-are-two/#two-much-posse) and in more detail [here](https://pluralistic.net/2021/01/13/two-decades/#hfbd). I just have to admire that kind of dedication to blogging.

Pluralistic is only two years old, but I've already linked to it quite a bit. Here are [my posts that link to Pluralistic](/domains/pluralistic.net/).
