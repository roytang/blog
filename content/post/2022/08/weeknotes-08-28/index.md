The year is almost two thirds done! Switching up the format a bit this week.

### Bits and Pieces

- The week was a bit rainy as we had a tropical storm pass by during the second half. Always makes my daily walks more challenging. Sleep was also irregular, which is sadly quite regular for me. Had to go out a few times for family errands. At least the hospital no longer requires us to fill up a form or get an antigen test just to walk in. Managed to get some work in on some side projects.

- **PH/Covid**: Cases continue to decline, and [even the positivity rate is going down](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1563839890751881217), so that's good. The DOH says [we might hit 9k cases per day by end-Septmber though](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/842885/doh-9k-covid-19-cases-daily-seen-by-end-september-to-october/story/), based on the assumption of increased mobility due to the return of face-to-face classes, the effect of which we should see in a week or two at most. Hopefully the projection doesn't come to pass.

- **Tech**: [Heroku is killing their free tier](https://blog.heroku.com/next-chapter). [Slack is increasing prices and tweaking their free plan](https://slack.com/help/articles/7050776459923-Pricing-changes-for-the-Pro-plan-and-updates-to-the-Free-plan). [Gitlab increasing limits to their free tier](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/03/24/efficient-free-tier/). I guess the pandemic has hit midlevel tech companies hard. I have one Heroku app that I'd need to migrate to my DigitalOcean droplet in the next couple of months. Slack one doesn't really affect me. Gitlab will have a 5gb storage limit for free accounts, but it looks like my repos there total less than 1gb, so I'm not yet affected for now. Somewhat related: here's [a cool Twitter thread about Replit](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1508251374257008640); it shows in detail why offering free storage/compute/resources online can be challenging at scale.

- I got access to DALL-E around a month ago, but I only decided to play around with it last week because I believe I have expiring credits? I took some suggestions from friends for prompts, but I don't think we're very good at the so-called "prompt engineering" yet. Here's some of the best ones I've generated so far:

- **Gaming**: I finished [Witcher 2](/2022/08/witcher2/)! Still playing **SMT5** and occasionally **Street Fighter V**. Did poorly at this weekend's Throne Open in **Eternal Card Game**. At least **I got to Mythic rank early** in **Magic Arena**.

- I've been watching a lot of **8 Out Of 10 Cats Does Countdown** on Youtube recently. (Surprisingly, the [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/pcrobec) which has all these episodes does not seem to be any sort of official channel?) I find some of the bits hilarious, particularly when Jon Richardson and/or Jon Locke are going at it. (Jimmy Carr not so much.) The UK has a lot of these panel shows, but for some reason the US doesn't have anything like them. (Maybe **Whose Line Is It Anyway**, which I also enjoy?)

- On the blog: Binged through [Better Call Saul and watched El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019)](/2022/08/bcs-camino/). And [read a bunch of Marvel comics](/2022/08/iron-man-v1/).

### This coming week:

- **Dominaria United** drops on Magic Arena on Thursday so I'll see if I can stream some limited on Friday maybe?
- **Rings of Power** is also dropping on Prime Video this week, but I'm not sure yet if I'll be watching it.
