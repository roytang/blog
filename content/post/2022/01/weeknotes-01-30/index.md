Last weekend of January. The days and nights are starting to get warmer, indicating the nearing end of January and of our pleasant weather conditions. From here on the temperatures will steadily increase until we return to the punishing midyear heat.

### My Stuff

- I had a chill week, though I did get a bit stressed out over US stocks crashing. I lost money!
- Still doing the [daily sketching](/albums/sketchbook/) but am behind for the weekend, as usual. Here's a digital sketch I did of Sol Badguy (from **Guilty Gear Strive**), where I forgot to remove the sketch lines:

    {{< collections-embed sketchbook 383c2c156e8aae0b5e7d96c606c33971 >}}

- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam). I think I am close to the end game, but it may take another week or so since I want to do a bunch of optional stuff.
    - Ongoing: Card games [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) and [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/). Managed to [hit master rank in Eternal](/2022/01/1487652400735215618/) just today, so both games are just derping around until the season rollover.
        - MTG had a big week though. There were some [bannings](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/news/january-25-2022-banned-and-restricted-announcement) and [alchemy rebalancings](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/magic-digital/alchemy-rebalancing-january-27-2022) all of which hopefully lead to better metas. Previews for the upcoming **Kamigawa Neon Dynasty** kicked off this week as well, and the [reveal stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LL7joWS8YsM) did a good "just one more thing" drop of a card / plot point at the end that made me shout out load.
    - Ongoing: Still playing the fighting games as well, though mostly only **Street Fighter V** now. I've managed to stay in Silver rank for a while, but the matches seem to be steadily getting harder!
- **Watching**:
    - No movies watched this week!
    - **TV:** 
        - Caught Up: **Star Trek Discovery**, **Superman and Lois**, **The Book of Boba Fett**, **NCIS**
            - watched all the currently available episodes of Boba Fett this week. Not particularly impressed. It feels like a western mob boss version of the Mandalorian? 
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**
        - Yet to start: **The Witcher** season 2, **Cobra Kai season 4**, **Peacemaker**
- **Reading**: Finished reading [Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey](/2022/01/leviathan-wakes/). Not yet sure what to read next.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions. You can follow along via [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- Chinese New Year is this Tuesday, which is a holiday in these parts
- a number of birthdays in the family this week as well
