title: New Year's Checklist 2022
---

Something I've gotten used to as the New Year rolls in: make a checklist of things to do and things I'm looking forward to for the new year. This one is coming in a bit late due to some business. This is my personal list, but maybe you'll enjoy going through it too. I generally copy stuff over, but the list changes a bit every year. Check out the [new-years-checklist tag] for previous years.

### The list, in no particular order:

  * Take stock and reflect on the past year
  * Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful
  * Greet your loved ones and friends and anyone else you hold dear. Maybe even those you disagree with. End some longstanding grudges even
  * Think about what you'd like to learn this year or how you want to improve
  * Change your passwords
  * Buy a new toothbrush
  * Set a target of how many books to read in 2022
  * Choose the first book to read
  * Throw away a few things you no longer need
  * Check out what movies are coming out this year and which ones you want to watch (see below)
  * Audit your financials -- where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc
  * Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that's gathered there over the past year
  * Make a list of projects you want to do in 2022
  * Choose something from the past year that you're going to stop watching or doing
  * Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great
  * Get rid of 2021 calendars
  * Make a list for the new year!
  * Clean up the photos on your phone, tablet and computer
  * Delete all files downloaded 2019 or earlier
  * Follow up on the people who owe you money or things
  * Review your recurring luxury costs (Netflix, etc) and evaluate whether you still really need them
  * Backups!
  * Export your Google, FB, Instagram and Twitter data
  * Wash your hands, keep your distance, avoid going out or meeting people unless absolutely necessary. We are still in a pandemic!
  * Speak truth to power. 
  * Be kind.
  * Relax, give yourself room to breathe and grow.
  * Figure out how to help people make better choices in this year's elections.
  * Maybe try to win an Arena Open?
  
### Some stuff I'm looking forward to in 2022. 

We are still in a pandemic, so who knows if these release dates hold! For movies, it doesn't even seem likely I'll be able to see them in theaters! I try to keep this list updated throughout the year as release dates get shuffled around.

(I freely admit this part is the more important one for me - it's basically a preview of the upcoming year in entertainment for me!)

#### Movies:

|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Jan 12 | Eternals (streaming release) |
| TBA | Spider-Man No Way Home (streaming release) |
| Feb 11 | Death on the Nile (Poirot) |
| Feb 18 | Uncharted |
| Mar 04 | The Batman |
| Mar 25 | [Everything Everywhere All at Once](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K8DNVS3-1Io) |

(5 of these were on last year's list!)

#### Games:

The only day-of-release retail purchase I'm looking forward to is the as-yet untitled **Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** sequel presumed to come out in Holiday 2022.

Other than that, I hope to at least play/finish the following games this year:

- Tales of Vesperia (Steam)
- Shin Megami Tensei V (Switch) (got a copy for Christmas!)
- Tales of Xillia 2 (PS3)


#### TV:

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|
| TBA | Ms Marvel |
| TBA | Moon Knight |
| TBA | She-Hulk |
| TBA | Secret Invasion |
| TBA | Invincible S2 |
| TBA | The Boys S3 |

So many TBAs! Also honestly probably forgetting a lot of TV series that also have new seasons coming out this year.
