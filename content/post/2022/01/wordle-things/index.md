title: Wordle and Things Like It
---

I first wrote about Wordle [back in November](/2021/11/couple-word-games/). Back then I thought it was neat and played it a few times, but not with any regularity.

The past couple of weeks, it's kind of gone viral. Seems like people everywhere of all shapes and sizes are playing it! I've also started playing it regularly, though I don't post the results on social media, a couple of my chat groups are active early in the morning when the new Wordle comes in.

The game itself is simple and clever. Difficult enough so that solving it feels good yet not too complicated for a casual player to get into, and not requiring a big vocabulary like some word games.

The real cleverness is in the share mechanism: that little grid of yellow and green squares that a lot of people post on social media, they look something like this:

> Wordle 213 5/6
> 
> ⬜⬜⬜⬜🟨
> 
> ⬜⬜⬜🟨⬜
> 
> 🟩⬜⬜⬜⬜
> 
> 🟩🟨🟨⬜🟩
> 
> 🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
> 

For people who play the game, this little grid tells a story. Since everyone plays the same Wordle, you can see at a glance which letters they had trouble with, whether they took the same route as you, and sometimes you can even try to figure out what guesses they made! It's a simple connection you can make even with strangers over the internet.

For people who don't play, it's a curiosity: what is this mysterious grid that I keep seeing on my timeline? So you look it up and try it out and there's a good chance you become a regular player too, and thus virality.

(For people who aren't curious and who get annoyed by everyone posting Wordles, mute the word and move on and maybe try to enjoy life a bit).

One other thing I like is that it's a webapp, not something I have to install from an app store or such!

Another interesting thing is that Wordle is the rare beast of a viral thing which isn't trying to make any sort of money whatsoever. It's a [labor of love](https://www.distractify.com/p/josh-wardle-partner) and it doesn't run ads or try to monetize your views in any way. Some guy [tried to make money off an App Store clone](https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1480543477775716352), he almost immediately got crucified and his app got pulled and [he had to apologize](https://twitter.com/zachshakked/status/1481129425706143746).

There's a pretty good chance Wordle is just a passing fad - most likely in December people will be going "Remember when everyone was playing that word game, what was it called? Turtle?!?" But it's nice that for the first few weeks of January, we got something viral that wasn't some person being dumb (see: "Bean Dad") and instead was just a fun little thing people enjoyed for a while.

If you enjoyed Wordle, here are some other variants / spoofs / spin-offs I've tried:

- [Absurdle](https://qntm.org/files/wordle/index.html): [an adversarial version of Wordle](https://qntm.org/wordle)
- [Saltong](https://saltong.vercel.app/): the inevitable Filipino clone. I assume other languages have similar versions already too!
- [Sweardle](https://www.sweardle.com/): only 4 letter swear words. Lol that's not gonna last
- [Letterle](https://edjefferson.com/letterle/): lol just a ridiculous spoof. I tried it once and somehow got it in the first try. So idk if this is rigged or I was just ridiculously lucky or what
