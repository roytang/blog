I love January; January weather is the best in the Philippines. Mornings are comfortably nippy, enough to make you want to stay in bed, and it's rare to get afternoons with the typical punishing heat. The pleasant weather also makes this month the best for taking long walks outdoors on the usually hot city streets, though I haven't been able to do this recently (I tell myself it's due to the pandemic.) Unfortunately, January is halfway over, which means our pleasant weather days are nearing their end.

### A Quote

> "The universe never tells us if we did right or wrong. It's more important to try and help people than to know you did. More important that someone else's life gets better than for you to feel good about yourself. You never know the effect you might have on someone, not really. Maybe one core thing you said haunts them forever. Maybe one moment of kindness gives them comfort, or courage. Maybe you said the one thing they needed to hear. It doesn't matter if you know. You just have to try."

### The World

- Covid/Omicron continues to tear through the country. Cases are still rising in NCR, but rates are slowing down and apparently plateauing. This is mot likely due to hitting the limits of officially-reported testing more than anything else, since the positivity rates are still record highs.
- Tennis legend Novak "Novax" Djokovic is [to be deported from Australia](https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-novak-djokovic-sports-health-australia-2ca1c31f867c05a49e66a8b8f8849477) (which includes a three-year ban!) for not being vaccinated. He will be unable to play the Australian Open, where he won the mens' single event for the past 3 years. It was really stupid to not just get vaccinated in order to defend his streak. A fine example of just comeuppance for the rich and powerful.

### My Stuff

- This stuff was less busy than before; I may have spent a bit too much time playing video games.
- In yet another sign that more and more people are staying at home and ordering everything online: we were unable to get any same-day grocery delivery slots this week; the next available slot was always a day or two away. Also my friendly local drugstore apologized for not being able to respond to my delivery request immediately, saying they were swamped. This was what it was like back in March 2020, in the early days of the pandemic.
- Am starting to fall behind on the [daily sketching](/albums/sketchbook/); currently behind by one day. Here's a doodle of someone out on a quiet walk:

- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam). Actually really enjoying this one and might be playing more than I should.
    - Ongoing: **Captain Toad Treasure Tracker** (Switch). IDK what Nintendo was thinking; this is a 10-hour game and they made it free to try for one week. I've been meaning to get it anyway, but now that it's free I'll just try to finish it in the one week trial period! I'm already more than halfway through with around 5 days to go, so there's a good chance I can finish it.
    - [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/) has an Alchemy open this weekend. I made my one attempt with Boros Dragons, throwing away some gold, but only got to two wins (needed four to advance, with no losses since it was best-of-3). At least I got back some gems, which I am immediately tempted to spend back on another run, but no, I should save up for the upcoming Kamigawa set.
- **Watching**:
    - This week's movies: [Eternals (2021)](/2022/01/eternals/) and [Tick, Tick... Boom! (2021)](/2022/01/2ffc2893357aca5b3cbf7d27510ade9c/)
    - **TV:** 
        - Finished watching [Arcane: League of Legends](/2022/01/7716cd7e971f869c82795cb6fcbc54e5/)
        - Watched [The Expanse](/2022/01/expanse/) series finale!
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**
        - Caught Up: **Star Trek Discovery**, **Superman and Lois** (new season just started)
        - Yet to start: **The Witcher** season 2, **The Book of Boba Fett**, **Cobra Kai season 4**, **Peacemaker**
- **Reading**: About halfway through **Leviathan Wakes by James S. A. Corey**, hopefully I'll finish it this coming week, but I don't have anything queued up afterwards yet.
- **Trivia**: Still doing NYT/WaPo crossword sessions over Discord. January streak still unbroken!

### This coming week:

- Nothing in my notes. Did I miss anything?
