  title: "Eternals (2021)"
---

Finally got to watch Eternals since it was already got a streaming release. (Sadly still unable to go out and watch films in the theater.)

This film had mixed reviews, and I can see why. For me, the main problem is that the film tries to do too many different things, and doesn't execute any of them particularly well. This is largely an offshoot of having such a large ensemble cast (there are TEN main characters!), each of whom are new to the MCU and thus are in need of backgrounds, personalities and character arcs. 

The problems are complicated by the premise that these ten characters are immortal space aliens who over the ages watched over humanity like gods. It's a premise that is difficult to make relatable (compare to say, the premise of Guardians of the Galaxy, where the main cast is basically some loveable screw-ups), and the large cast makes it difficult to develop any of them particularly well.

The film is too ambitious for its own good, trying to mix the epic with the interpersonal, and ending up not being very good at either one. There are some great action sequences and some funny parts (though I feel like some of the CGI could have been better), but overall the film has trouble coming together as a whole. 

It looks like they are planning a sequel and hopefully they manage to improve on it, although the MCU does not have a good track record for 2nd franchise films (Thor 2 and Iron Man 2 were notably considered among the worst of the MCU, and Guardians 2 and Avengers 2 coming off a bit meh as well, although Captain America: Winter Soldier was a happy exception).
