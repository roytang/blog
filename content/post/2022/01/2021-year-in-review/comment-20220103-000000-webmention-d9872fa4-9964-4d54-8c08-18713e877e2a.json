      "html": "<p>Happy New Year\u2014yet again! What better way to start the year than a blog post covering the entire previous year in a bird\u2019s eye view? I like reading others' year in reviews, such as <a href=\"https://roytang.net/2022/01/2021-year-in-review/\">Roy\u2019s</a>, <a href=\"https://winnielim.org/journal/looking-back-at-2021/\">Winnie\u2019s</a>, and <a href=\"https://obsolete29.com/posts/2021/12/28/my-2021-in-review/\">Mike\u2019s</a>. They\u2019re humbling and somehow help me cope with my own issues. I have a habit of summarizing personal events in \u201c365\u201d pages in my journals. They are interesting to look back to: it\u2019s both painful (past or present lingering personal issues stare me right in the face) and joyful (personal and professional achievements are also listed that deserve more attention).</p>\n<h3>Highlights</h3>\n<h4>1. The Blog</h4>\n<p>In 2021, I managed to write more than <a href=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2021\">ninety blog posts</a>, almost four times as much as in 2020. The evolution of Brain Baking is one of the things I\u2019m very proud of and helped me keep sane throughout the year. I discovered the IndieWeb, tried out Webmentions, wrote my own server in Go, discovered Mastodon, integrated it in the site, removed it, parsed more RSS, removed it yet again, added support of the Gemini protocol, dropped it, gave more attention to accessibility, \u2026</p>\n<p>Experimentation and fiddling with the site has been an highly enjoyable pass-time that netted new friends and connections, serendipitous discoveries, fire-started the learning of new programming languages, made me join random Zoom sessions and learn more about personal knowledge management and Obsidian, broadened my overall knowledge horizon, and most of all: made me reflect more. Thanks everyone for your support!</p>\n<h4>2. The Retro Office</h4>\n<p>In February, I completely redid my home office (see <a href=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/02/my-retro-desktop-setup/\">my retro desk/gaming setup in 2021</a>). Just in time, because in 2021, I worked almost exclusively from home, except for on-campus classes. Bike ride to university, teaching, and bike ride home to continue researching. The small investment made a big impact: in my tiny home office, I feel safe, ideas constantly bubble up, I can focus, and if in dire need of a bit off-loading, relax as well. It\u2019s been another quite productive professional year, which I completely attribute to the sole presence of my beloved 40486. Cheers, ISA slots.</p>\n<h4>3. Miauw.</h4>\n<p>We got a second cat. I said no twenty times. The twenty-first time, we were on our way to pick her up. I learned that my wife can be quite persistent (I already knew that, she married me!).</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/01/bonnie.jpg\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/01/bonnie.jpg\" title=\"Bonnie, our Ragdoll kitten, frequently challenging my writing sessions.\" alt=\"bonnie.jpg\" /></a>\n\t\n\t\tBonnie, our Ragdoll kitten, frequently challenging my writing sessions.<p>Muesli, our nine year old British Shorthair, is <em>not</em> amused. It took over a month to get over it, and he still loathes her presence. All she wants to do\u2014besides tearing down the place\u2014is cuddle with him. Luckily our Golden Retriever doesn\u2019t mind. I\u2019m still not sure whether it was such a great move. The 2022 year in review will probably tell.</p>\n<p>We also got three new chickens and built a bigger fully covered fence for them.</p>\n<h3>Lowlights</h3>\n<p>I think I can safely write that the year 2021 has been difficult for everyone. So vaccination doesn\u2019t magically solve things huh? Mouth masks mandated, not anymore, mandated, not anymore, restaurants closing, not anymore, closing, not anymore. It\u2019s clear that our local government doesn\u2019t know what to do either. It seems that we\u2019re looking at yearly booster shots now.</p>\n<p>Besides COVID making it harder for everyone to engage socially for obvious reasons, I\u2019ve been constantly struggling with loneliness the past year. It\u2019s difficult to even write about it. The global pandemic made everyone feel a bit lonely, but it\u2019s not the pandemic that is causing it\u2014although it sure is accelerating it. I have the feeling that the shift from industry to academia is one of the perpetrators. It\u2019s been since August 2018, but now it\u2019s starting to hit hard. I miss having colleagues. I miss frequent pairing sessions. I miss debating and discussing issues. I miss feeling equal. I miss mattering. It\u2019s like my academic colleague <a href=\"https://ineed.coffee/\">Daniel Graziotin</a> said: research is awesome but lonely (thanks for your support, Daniel). Not a day goes by that I don\u2019t think about quitting.</p>\n<p>And I will. Eventually. But my work is not yet done, and I have the feeling that it is important. If not to someone else, then at least, <em>to me</em>. In the summer of 2021, an idea of writing a book about creativity for programmers started crystallizing. A book that should marry theory and our findings with practice and my industry experience\u2014a hybrid approach, so to speak. It re-kindled my motivational flame, and I am yet unable to let go.</p>\n<p>But it doesn\u2019t make it easier. I still feel very lonely. I\u2019m trying to excavate my emotions to gain more insight as to the <em>why</em>. I hope to write more about it publicly when I have the guts to do so. My low energy supply caused me to neglect my interest in food and cooking. The vegetable garden was also not well maintained. Ah well, who knows, this year the pigeons might <em>not</em> steal the bean seeds!</p>\n<h3>Minorlights</h3>\n<p>A bullet list of random minor events of 2021:</p>\n<ul><li>My wife and I rekindled our interest in Magic: the Gathering\u2014again!
