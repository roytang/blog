### A Quote

### The World

- PH elections: GMA aired a series of Jessica Soho last night where she interviewed the top presidential candidates; the most infamous one declined the invite and claimed the award-winning journalist was "biased". I guess that's what happens when a lot of your history is indefensible, you treat anyone who doesn't worship you as "biased". 
- PH covid: Daily new cases seem to have plateaued at around 30k, but the positivity rates remain high (in the 40s), so who knows what the real numbers are. More areas outside the NCR are becoming critical. It may be a few weeks before cases start to taper off.
- A [huge volcanic eruption hit the island nation of Tonga late last week](https://theconversation.com/why-the-volcanic-eruption-in-tonga-was-so-violent-and-what-to-expect-next-175035). Apparently it was [more powerful than nuke tests](https://www.npr.org/2022/01/21/1074438703/nuclear-test-monitor-calls-tonga-volcano-blast-biggest-thing-that-weve-ever-seen). The island nation was devastated in [the unprecedented disaster](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-60039617) and was [knocked offline](https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/01/18/1043790/tongas-volcano-internet-reconnected/), it took days to even restore communications.
- [Russia is on the brink of invading Ukraine](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/14/russia-could-invade-ukraine-within-next-month-us-intelligence.html), and no threat of sanctions seem to be slowing Putin down.
- For some ill-advised reason, Twitter has decided to [support NFT profile pics](https://twitter.com/TwitterBlue/status/1484226540984356864).

### My Stuff

- Worked on the site a bit this past week; some bug fixes here and there, a few minor CSS tweaks, some new features. Maybe I could whip up a blog post about the changes, some kind of changelog?
- Am behind a few days on the [daily sketching](/albums/sketchbook/); typical for a weekend. I did open up this new sketchbook and pencil and eraser I got over Christmas and did a few sketches with them. Here's one of Rachel Summers:
