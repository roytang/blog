title: The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha Christie
---

Decided to kick off the year's reading with a short one: The Mysterious Affair at Styles by Agatha Christie. This was her first published novel and also the first appearance of famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot! I was able to finish the book in one sitting, something I haven't done in a while!

I've only read [two other Poirot books](/2021/05/orient-express-nile/), and this one obviously came earlier in Christie's career. While it's still reasonably good, I found the pacing not as tight as those other two books. I guess it's mainly because those other two books took place in restricted environments where Poirot was entirely in control of the situation and thus were resolved quickly. 

In this one, it takes Poirot months to piece everything together with evidence, although he has leanings early on. I didn't even bother trying to solve the mystery myself; Poirot had knowledge the reader didn't, and even makes attempts at misdirection to throw off the culprit(s) and perhaps the reader as well. Still, it's a decent enough read with a satisfying ending. 

I'm not sure I'd be able to finish reading all the Poirot books in my lifetime; [Wikipedia lists 47 of them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot_in_literature#Hercule_Poirot_and_fictional_canon), and it seems I can read maybe 2-3 of them a year (since I have a bunch of other things I want to read). We shall see!
