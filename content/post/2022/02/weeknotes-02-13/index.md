### The World

- PH: Campaign season has officially kicked off here, so last week was full of proclamation rallies and such.
- Covid: Cases have continued to drop, furthering a descent into normalcy. Last few days have been averaging under 5k new cases per day, down from under 10k per day last week.  
- Tech: Facebook/Meta [threaten to pull out of Europe](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/meta-threatens-to-shut-down-facebook-and-instagram-in-europe.html). Some EU politcians were like ["Haha sure go ahead"](https://appleinsider.com/articles/22/02/07/eu-lawmakers-unfazed-by-metas-threat-that-it-would-pull-out-of-europe).

### My Stuff

- a couple of days ago I had a miserable time spent arguing with customer service about some billing thing. Can't write about it in detail yet because it's not yet resolved. Needing to talk to any kind of customer service is always a pain though.
- I still get a bit annoyed whenever I see threads on social media about people being dumb/misinformed over politics. Sometimes [I am compelled to respond](/2022/02/facts/).
- On the blog: Other than the media reviews, I wrote [a ranty thing about URLs](/2022/02/urls/) and [some thoughts about Instant Messaging apps](/2022/02/im-apps/). That last one got a good number of likes/shares for some reason.

- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: 
        - I finished **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam)! The main game at least. As is typical of the series, there's quite a lot of post-game content to get through; IDK yet if I'll have the patience to do everything, but I'll give it a try for a couple of weeks at least.
        - I also wanted to play a non-RPG for a while, so after browsing through the near-infinite Steam backlog, I decided to start playing a platformer, **Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair**
    - Ongoing Card games: [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) and [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/).
        - the latest set **Kamigawa Neon Dynasty** has dropped on Magic Arena! I've started streaming some drafts; although I haven't done particularly well so far. Follow along via [the mtgneo tag](/tags/mtgneo/) or [the Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXhLIY5zAbmQn-tSxCE5RWgs).
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Still playing the occasional **Street Fighter V** match. 
- **Watching**:
    - No movies watched this week. I did [write about Spider-Man: No Way Home](/2022/02/spider-man-no-way-home/) though.
    - **TV:** 
        - I did watch a bunch of TV this week though! I finished [the Witcher season 2, The Book of Boba Fett, and Murderville](/2022/02/tv-bobafett-witcher2-murderville/). I've also started watching Peacemaker, but I think the season still has a few episodes left.
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**, **Superman and Lois**, **NCIS**, **Peacemaker**, **Star Trek Discovery**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**
- **Reading**: Still reading **Meditations by Marcus Aurelius** (with intro by Gregory Hays). I think I can finish it this week.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions, you can follow along via [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). (some Filipino slips in here and there, but most of it should be in English.) Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

There's this project I've been meaning to get back into, hopefully I can kick it into gear this week. Also some improvements to the site backend (refactoring etc) that have been pending for a while!
