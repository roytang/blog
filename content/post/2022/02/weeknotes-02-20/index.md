### A Quote

> “Can you remember who you were, before the world told you who you should be?” — Danielle LaPorte

### The World

- PH Elections: [The surveys](/2022/02/on-surveys/) look bad for the good guys.
- Covid: NCR now averaging 500 or less new cases per day. We are still in Alert Level 2 though. 
- The spectre of war continues to loom over Ukraine.

    - > "In many ways, Kickstarter’s weird crypto project — and the blockchain aspirations other aging web 2.0 companies are pushing on us right now — are kind of like watching a middle-aged man buy a boat. He doesn’t need to buy a boat. His life will be significantly more complicated, and likely worse, after he buys the boat. But he has somehow convinced himself that he needs to buy this boat because he has done the math and realized he is going to die soon and he thinks the boat will fix this. Even though there are plenty of other easy and normal things he could do to feel better about this, he’s going to buy the boat. And we’re all going to have to watch and feel awkward about it."

### My Stuff

- Last year I applied for a Quezon City ID because they initially said they would use it for the vaccination program. That was back in February 2021! They ended up using other registration methods for the vaccination. Last week I got a text that I could go claim my QC ID, one year after! The place to claim it was about a 45-minute walk away from home, which wasn't too bad. Since the pandemic started, I've limited my daily walks to short distances mostly inside our subdivision. With the lowering of new cases, I took this opportunity to start going for longer walks again; hopefully I can do 1 or 2 long walks a week to get back into a good exercise rhythm.
- Last Friday, after a somewhat long walk, I also decided to have dinner at a restaurant for the first time in a long while; I think this is only the 3rd time I've dined out since the pandemic began. I did regret it a bit, since prices have apparently risen quite a bit and the servings seemed so small now. =/
- Something I've been meaning to do for a while: I refactored some stuff in this site's backend, in the parts that import my posts from Twitter/Reddit, mostly to avoid repeating code and logic in several places, and to make future enhancements easier.
- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: 
        - **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam): Still going through post-game content; there's a lot, so this may take a while.
        - I found myself enjoying **Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair** quite a bit. I was initially planning to take the game slowly but I think I'm around 50% through the game already.
    - Ongoing Card games: [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) and [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/).
        - Still struggling with **Kamigawa Neon Dynasty** drafts on Magic Arena. The 7-x draft is still elusive. Really need to get good at the format, since I want to play the limited open next weekend! Follow along via [the mtgneo tag](/tags/mtgneo/) or [the Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXhLIY5zAbmQn-tSxCE5RWgs).
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Still playing the occasional **Street Fighter V** match. Thinking about picking up the new King of Fighters as well, since I've stopped playing Guilty Gear Strive.
    - Nintendo released a website that [lets you export your stats for WiiU and 3DS](/2022/02/1493818986571526146/). I want even more detailed stats though!
- **Watching**:
    - Movies: Watched [Ghostbusters: Afterline (2021)](/2022/02/ghostbusters-afterlife/) and [Palm Springs (2020)](/2022/02/palm-springs/) this week.
    - **TV:** 
        - Season finale of **Peacemaker** aired this past week. Will see if I can write some words about it this coming week.
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**, **Superman and Lois**, **NCIS**, **Star Trek Discovery**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**
- **Reading**: Finished reading [**Meditations by Marcus Aurelius** (with intro by Gregory Hays)](/2022/02/meditations/). Not yet sure what to read next.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions, you can follow along via [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). (some Filipino slips in here and there, but most of it should be in English.) Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- Magic Arena Limited Open next weekend!
- This coming week is the 35th anniversary of the 1986 EDSA Revolution that ousted the dictator Marcos.
