I'm not big on rom-coms, but I am big on time loops and Groundhog Day is one of [my all-time favorite movies](/2018/10/my-top-10-favorite-movies-of-all-time/), so I decided to give Palm Springs (2020) a shot. It's basically a Groundhog Day-style time loop movie where more than one person is caught in the same loop. And the setting is a wedding, making an easy setup for the romcom. 

The film stars Andy Samberg and Cristin Milioti as the romcom pair trapped in the same loop. JK Simmons and Tyler "Superman" Hoechlin also appear. The performances in the film are pretty good. It's also a decent comedy, though not the "Haha LOL" kind, more of Andy Samberg getting to be ridiculous because his character has been in the loop so long he simply doesn't care anymore.

It is a significantly less kid-friendly film compared to Groundhog Day (mostly due to sex), probably good to know. 

My favorite part is of course the whole sci-fi time loop aspect; unlike Groundhog Day, the time loop here is clearly explored as a scientific phenomenon instead of a karma thing. Although there is still less emphasis on explaining how they got into the loop in the first place. In fact, the film starts in the middle of the loop; Samberg's character has already been stuck there a while when the film starts and little importance is attached to the main character's backgrounds before the day of the wedding.

There is a post-credits scene, which answers at least one lingering question about how this whole time loop works.
