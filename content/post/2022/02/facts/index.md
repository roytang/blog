I think one of the questions to ask in this sort of convo is "ayaw mo ba malaman ang katotohanan?" If they say they don't care about the truth, you know who they are and convo is done. If they say otherwise, you are free to try to convince them. 

<time>[18:31]</time> Of course, this means that we too must be willing to chase down the truth - show an openness to changing your own mind about the "facts" if evidence can be shown otherwise. If you believe in your candidate, the truth is not an obstacle.

<time>[18:35]</time> (I would also prefer more positive messages about the elections in my feed rather than posts about people being idiots, it's bad for our collective faith in humanity. And possibly a waste of time...)
