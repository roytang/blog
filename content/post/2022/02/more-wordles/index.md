title: Even More Wordles
---

I've still been playing Wordle since [the last time I wrote about it](/2022/01/wordle-things/). Still 100% win rate, and currently on 24-day streak (would have been longer, except in early January, I decided to test what would happen if I set my system date to the future since the game uses the client's date).

Aside from the OG Wordle, two variants have also made their way into my daily routine (technically four variants, depending on how you count them):

- [Saltong](https://saltong.carldegs.com/), the Filipino version which I already mentioned in the last post. This one actually has three different variants: there's normal **Saltong** (same as Wordle, except using a Filipino dictionary), **Saltong Mini** (4 letters and 5 guesses), and **Saltong Max** (7 letters and 8 guesses). By far Saltong Mini is the hardest of all the variants I've played so far; it's the only one that has ever given me any losses, and my win rate currently stands at a miserable 59%. Additionally, the site also has **Saltong Hex**, a Filipino variant of the NYT Spelling Bee. (You can watch me and my trivia team play both Saltong Hex and the NYT Spelling Bee [in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzChd4JRFP0), if you like.) I like this project; it seems to be updated regularly, it's [open source](https://github.com/carldegs/saltong) and [they even fixed an issue I logged](https://github.com/carldegs/saltong/issues/38). My only complaints are that the frontend performance can be poor (page might take a couple of seconds to fully load) and that the Filipino dictionary they use excludes a lot of common word variants, but that's a bit forgiveable because Filipino is generally a difficult language with far too many possible word variants.
- [Dordle](https://zaratustra.itch.io/dordle) is a new variant where you have to guess two words, using the same set of guesses for each one. This version isn't as polished UI-wise (it doesn't even remember your previous run if you reload the page!), but the puzzle aspect is a bit stronger than regular Wordle.

Some other new variants that I've checked out over the past couple of weeks:

- [Obscurdle](http://obscurdle.com/) is a set of 12 Wordle-themed puzzles where the color markings on each word mean something different for each puzzle and part of solving the puzzle is figuring that out so you can generate the required patterns. I've only finished up to puzzle 4 and haven't felt like coming back yet.
- [Squirdle](https://squirdle.fireblend.com/daily) is a Pokemon Wordle-like where you have to guess the Pokemon. Each guess gets a response in the form of five icons each representing Generation, Type 1, Type 2, Height, Weight (whether they match the target pokemon or are too high/low). A neat idea, but a bit too niche and I don't have enough Pokemon knowledge for this.
- [Nerdle](https://nerdlegame.com/) is a number version of Wordle where you have to guess an **equation**, and each of your guesses must be a valid equation as well. I solved a couple then never came back up. I like math, but this feels too un-casual to be a daily thing for me.
- [Kotobade Asobou 言葉で遊ぼう](https://taximanli.github.io/kotobade-asobou/) is a Japanese wordle variant that someone suggested to me because they knew I was doing Japanese on [Duolingo](/tags/Japanese). It only uses the hiragana character set, but my vocab and character familiarity still weren't good enough for this, so I noped out of it.
- [Kuan](https://kuan.vercel.app/) is a Bisaya clone (Bisaya is a Filipino dialect), it's fairly new. I don't speak Bisaya, so I never tried this one.

In other Wordle news, the [New York Times purchased the game for a tidy sum](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/media/new-york-times-wordle.html) last week. They say it will remain free (for now at least), but this might be the beginning of the end for its virality? Well, I also said in early January it might not last more than a couple of weeks, so I might be wrong there too. We'll see!
