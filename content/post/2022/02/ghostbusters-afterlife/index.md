I've been putting off watching this one because I was afraid it would ruin whatever nostalgia I had for the original 1984 film, one of my all-time favorites. I haven't even watched the 2016 Ghostbusters either for this same reason.

A few days ago, Ivan Reitman, who directed the original two films and produced this one, passed away. So I decided it was a good time to finally watch the film.

I loved the film! It was a very worthy successor to the legacy of the franchise, full of heart and nostalgia.

The setting was moved to small-town middle America, far away from the hustle and bustle of New York, and focuses more on family and rediscovering old connections rather than the business (someone once said that Ghostbusters was the best movie about running a startup...).

I love how the plot is teased and unfolds from the very start, showing us early hints of what we knew was coming down the line. The plot ties directly to the first movie and neatly explains in-continuity why the Ghostbusters faded away after the 80s. 

The kids were great. Kid from Stranger Things performs like he's still in Stranger Things though lol.

McKenna Grace, who plays Spengler's granddaughter Phoebe, reminded me so much of Harold Ramis I was wondering whether they had actually cast someone related to him.

I loved all the callbacks and how closely the plot ties in to the original, right down to the predictable selection of who the new Keymaster and Gatekeeper would be.

Tiny Stay-Pufts! I had seen these in the trailer but only remembered when they actually happened in the film.

Spengler drifting apart from the team and all of them showing up near the end to lend a hand and finally reconcile and say goodbye to Egon reminded me so much of how Ramis and Murray had been feuding for years before finally burying the hatchet at Ramis' deathbed. A fitting tribute to a departed friend.

Really happy to have finally seen it; if I had the chance to watch it in the theater I may very well have been clapping at the end.

There are a couple of post-credits scenes, with hints towards possible additional sequels. I'm down for that, but even if they leave it here for the foreseeable future it would be a good finale for the franchise.
