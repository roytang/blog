Ever since the introduction of the GDPR in Europe, we as consumers have been able to request a so-called \u201ctakeout\u201d of our own data, the data that companies have and keep track of us. This goes from a simple name + address + email list to a complicated zip-file containing gigabytes of scary things, like Google\u2019s takeout, available at <a href=\"https://takeout.google.com/\">https://takeout.google.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>The problem is, what do we learn from that data? Which patterns emerge? How serious is this data tracking thing, really? You\u2019d have to dig through log files, photos, e-mails, conversations, telephone records, etc and categorize/group timestamps to get an idea on how bad the situation is. That is where TransparencyVis comes in: drop your takeout zip file from services such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc, and they\u2019ll render a nice visualization for you:</p>\n<p></p><a href=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/02/takeout.jpg\">\n\t\t<img src=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2022/02/takeout.jpg\" title=\"My Google Takeout, visualized.\" alt=\"takeout.jpg\" /></a>\n\t\n\t\tMy Google Takeout, visualized.<p>This is about <code>2 GiB</code> of information, excluding photos, but including Google Drive documents. At first, the scatter plot still is a bit confusing. The easiest way to look at it is this: the vertical bands are timestamps, and each dot\u2014more smears is more activity\u2014is a recorded activity. You can see that between 7AM and 8AM, up to 23PM, a <em>lot</em> of stuff was gathered. But what\u2019s more scary: between 2015 and 2018, even during the night, when I generally turn my smartphone OFF, it was somehow still sending data? At least those events are timestamped at a nighttime. The orange dots are <em>location trackers</em> (Google Location tracking). The pink ones are <em>conversation trackers</em> (Google Hangouts chat history). The (hard to see) green ones are <em>browsing history</em> (Google Chrome).</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of 2021, I\u2019ve been <a href=\"https://brainbaking.com/post/2021/03/getting-rid-of-tracking-using-lineageos/\">gradually getting rid of my Google life</a>. Before the Google Takeout, I already:</p>\n<ul><li>Deleted all Google Photos;</li>\n<li>Deleted all Google Maps locations;</li>\n<li>Deleted most critical e-mail conversations;</li>\n</ul><p>However, I decided to keep the e-mail account as a spam catch-all. My behavior towards reclaiming my privacy is clearly visible in the above scatter plot:</p>\n<ul><li>Since 2018, I stopped using Nexus phones and disabled Google\u2019s location tracking service (less but still present orange dots);</li>\n<li>Since half 2019, I stopped using Google Hangouts (no more pink dots);</li>\n<li>Since 2020, I stopped using Google Chrome (no more green dots);</li>\n<li>Since 2021, I stopped using Android all-together;</li>\n</ul><p>My first Google-enabled phone, a Nexus 4, was bought in 2014\u2014that\u2019s no coincidence, judging from the graph. Things got worse since then. To me, it is really, <em>really</em> scary to analyze this takeout, especially because of the location tracking I was blissfully unaware of back in the day. Sure, you can turn that down (somewhat), but the point is that it\u2019s enabled by default, and if you are simply a casual Android user, you have no idea!</p>\n<p>Furthermore, all Google Hangouts conversations, even from back in 2014, is unencrypted and accounted for. This goes from casual chats with friends to serious matters with my wife that I am very uncomfortable with sharing with Google\u2014or any online service, for that matter, even if it would be my own. I even found Google Chrome history from 2012 with loads of eBay searchers for jewelry (not mine, haha, but still!). If all this doesn\u2019t wake you up, I\u2019m not sure what does. I have a few colleagues who are very fatalistic in this matter: \u201cThey\u2019ll track you anyway, I say let them have it!\u201d. I personally think that\u2019s a very dangerous statement to make.</p>\n<h2>What to do about it?</h2>\n<p>Simple.

No. If you read about <a href=\"https://blog.sugoi.be/posts/that-hell-called-linkedin/\">that hell called LinkedIn</a>, the conclusion is that while it sucks, closing the account isn\u2019t always an option:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Why don\u2019t I close my account instead of complaining? Because LinkedIn is unfortunatelly the goto place to check someone\u2019s professional profile. Same reason why I have a Facebook account: it\u2019s because everybody\u2019s there. Not because I enjoy their product.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I sympathize. While I did get rid of my LinkedIn account (seriously, your website is your CV), I feel very much the same for things like WhatsApp. Roy Tang wrote about <a href=\"https://roytang.net/2022/02/im-apps/\">instant messaging apps</a> and published an interesting chart containing recommendations for use, privacy-wise and open-source-wise. The conclusion? We should rely on decentralized solutions such as Jabber/XMPP and Matrix and avoid WhatsApp/Facebook (Messenger). I\u2019d love to self-host these things, but convincing my family to use them is simply not going to happen.

E-mail is inherently unencrypted, and while I\u2019m fine with that, I\u2019m not fine with Google collecting information on my purchase and vacation behavior. But what is the point of shunning Google services if 80% of the internet does not follow along?
