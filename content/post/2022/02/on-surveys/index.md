The campaign season is officially in full swing here in the Philippines, and so is one of the mainstays of our electorcal circus: surveys.

This past week, one of the big two survey firms in the country released their most recent survey on the 2022 presidential race:

While the results are disheartening (more on that later), it's only natural that any political survey will tend to favor one side or another. Whenever such surveys come out, there are always those voices expressing disbelief about surveys in general etc. 

Some of the more common thoughts / responses I see:

- *"How can these surveys be accurate, they ask such a small number of people?"*: Anyone who asks something like this has likely not taken anything akin to a basic statistic course; random probabilistic sampling is a commonly accepted method of using a smaller sample to predict qualities of a large set of respondents. I can understand the incredulity, but done properly, the results should be reflective of the larger population, within a certain margin of error. (Of course it's possible that "done properly" may be carrying too much weight here...)
- *"This doesn't reflect what I see in my area"* or *"Online surveys have different results"* or similar: This indicates a tendency to favor local or anecdotal knowledge over statistical data analyzed over a much larger area and sample size. The timing of the above survey results (where some of the candidates that recently held massive campaign kickoff rallies turned out to perform poorly) only highlights this contrast. Even if "what you see" has a similar number of samples compared to the formal surveys, nonrandom selection also means your results will tend to skew one way or another. This is why different candidates can seem to be "winning", especially for informal surveys done using the internet, where the tendency is that respondents are *self-selected*, that is, you are polling people who are already predisposed towards a certain result. 
- *"I don't know anybody who has participated in any of these surveys."*: The sample sizes for these surveys are typically in the low thousands, for a total population of maybe 60-70 million voters? Unless you personally know and have spoken to roughly 50,000 people you are not likely at all to have participated in the surveys. Also, I would assume respondents are held to some level of secrecy? But that is largely speculation on my part.

Of course it's possible for surveys to have a certain bias or inaccurate one way or another. Many factors can affect survey bias, including phrasing of questions and presentation of choices; and of course the sampling methodology can be flawed; sometimes even the survey period or release date can affect how the results are perceived. But survey firms like SWS and Pulse Asia live or die on their reputations. If they come out with results that are too far-fetched or turn out to be far removed from actual outcomes or diverge wildly from other surveys with similar scope, their reputations can take a hit and fewer people will be inclined to believe in them or commission surveys with them. This incentivizes them to try to be as methodical and as accurate as possible. 

This reminds me of an incident during the May 2016 where [some random unknown survey firm came out with survey results suggesting Roxas and Poe tied for first place](https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/70212/d-strafford-defends-latest-presidential-survey), a result so ridiculous nobody took it seriously.

For the reasons laid out above, I am inclined to take survey results from the bigger survey firms on their face value.

Around this time, there are often cranks [who want to ban election surveys](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/02/17/22/presidential-aspirant-abella-wants-ban-on-survey-results) or otherwise regulate them. Presumably because they may create trends or condition the public one way or another. This is like trying to ban or regulate propaganda; it can't be done without obstructing freedom of speech. You can't stop people from declaring who they think is going to win, whether that's through a survey or a press release or whatever.

It would be better to educate the voting populace somehow, but for some reason very few of our leaders seem interested in that.

It's true that "bandwagoning" is a big problem; mainly because too many Filipino voters treat elections as tribal challenges where if you manage to align yourself with the "winning side" you get to gloat or something? IDK, I don't really get it. 

People need to learn that [not voting for someone coz he's not going to win is saying your vote doesn't matter. Your vote is your voice, not a bet on who will win.](/2010/05/13431880650/)

Now for this particular set of survey results in particular (and my own political preferences obviously play a role in this section): It is in fact very disheartening to see the dictator's do-nothing son with such a commanding lead. I don't think I've ever seen a lead this large before, predicting not just a plurality win but a majority win even. That being said, it isn't exactly surprising; this candidate has a large number of resources at his disposal (both legal and less than legal presumably) and his camp's propaganda game is very strong. Ever since Duterte won in 2016 with an unprecedented vote count, the tendency has only been for that base to consolidate further. And he has managed to gather support from several different political clans and figures (although the specific ones involved tell you a lot about what kind of "alliance" this really is). 

So for supporters of those candidates who are so far behind, it is quite understandable to question or to be disheartened at the results. But regardless of whether or not these results are accurate, we always knew it was going to be an uphill battle. We knew that we were facing opponents with much more resources, much more influence, and the fight was always going to be challenging. The same was true back in the 2016 VP race, and though that race was won, it was still very, very close, and this time the other side is much stronger and has learned from its mistakes (including apparently letting their candidate talk freely in front of panels not primed in his favor). But 2016 also taught us that such lopsided battles can still be won, that survey results can change greatly in the runup to the election. 

There is still much of the fight left to be fought. In the end there is only one survey result that matters for this election: the nationwide one in May 2022.

On a lighter note, I have had a tendency to [run informal surveys on my friends via social media through the years](notes/tagged/survey/?page=6), although responses have tapered off since I quit Facebook. Feel free to respond to any of those surveys though, even the older ones!
