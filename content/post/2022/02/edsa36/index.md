This week marks the 36th anniversary of the 1986 EDSA revolution, the nonviolent series of protests that unseated the dictator Ferdinand Marcos. Marcos had the nation under an iron grip since he declared Martial Law in 1972 and used that time to plunder the countries resources and bend the institutions to his will. Numerous atrocities, abuses of power and human rights violations were documented during this period, and to this day, government agencies estimate there are still billions more in ill-gotten wealth yet to be recovered.

Officially, Feb 25 is a holiday to commemorate the event. Today, I'm worried about the future of this celebration. Marcos' son, a participant in his father's regime, a liar and a convicted tax evader, is the leading candidate for the upcoming presidential elections this coming May. He rose to popularity on the back of a years-long dedicated propaganda and historical revisionism scheme, magnified by social media. He vows to continue his father's "legacy", painting it as a "Golden Age" for the country. It is not far-fetched to imagine that if he takes power, this holiday and the corresponding commemoration may be deprioritized or gotten rid of all-together. This may be the last year it officially gets celebrated.

The other day I read [an article about a Chinese student in Australia who tore down posters about Tiananmen Square](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10531967/Chinese-student-rips-Tiananmen-Square-posters-University-Queensland.html), saying the 1989 massacre never happened. My first thought after reading this article was amazement at how successful China's censorship and propaganda regimes were at revising their own history. Probably entire generations of Chinese citizens grew up believing in the government's lies. My second thought was that this may be a preview of the Philippines' own possible future should Marcos come into power.

EDSA had it's faults; It was in many ways, an unfinished revolution. We failed to properly hold the Marcoses to account and now it's coming back to bite us. Many of those in power during Marcos times managed to stick around to the succeeding post-EDSA governments. We observe this occasion not only to celebrate a shining moment in history, but also to remember the lessons we **should** have learned as a nation and to continue to find a way forward, not backward.
