### A Quote

### The World

- PH: The legislature has signed off on a mandatory SIM card registration bill that now only awaits the President's signature. It [seems a bit problematic](/2022/02/1489915785828990981/). Here's [some more info/criticism](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/02/04/2158543/mandatory-sim-card-registration-puts-privacy-risk-might-not-curb-crime).

### My Stuff

- One last sketch, for the road:

- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam). I am definitely very close to finishing the game, but I have vastly estimated just how much extra stuff there is to do first. I spent most of the week doing optional quests, finding extra dungeons, grinding for crafting materials, etc. Haven't even done the coliseum stuff yet! Why do I so enjoy a genre that takes so much time!
    - Ongoing Card games: [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/) and [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/).
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Now down to only playing the occasional **Street Fighter V** match. Still managing to just barely staying in Silver rank, little progress otherwise.
- **Watching**:
    - For the first time since December 2019, I decided to go out and brave the movies this weekend to finally watch **Spider-Man: No Way Home**. I have mixed feelings about the film, will write about it tomorrow probably. In the meantime, I look forward to the anxiety of the next few days while I wait around for possible symptoms due to going to the mall.
    - **TV:** 
        - Not much TV this week, though I did make it halfway through the new Witcher season.
        - Caught Up: **Star Trek Discovery**, **The Book of Boba Fett**
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**, **The Witcher** season 2, **Superman and Lois**, **NCIS**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**, **Peacemaker**
- **Reading**: Started reading **Meditations by Marcus Aurelius** (with intro by Gregory Hays). Philosophy time!
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions. We record some of our sessions, you can follow along via [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). (some Filipino slips in here and there, but most of it should be in English.) Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- **Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty** drops on Magic Arena on Thursday!
