### The World

- Can you imagine a world still reeling/recovering from a global pandemic where so many people suffered, and thinking to yourself "You know what, that's not enough, the world still needs even more suffering!" That's exactly what Vladimir Putin did when he declared war on and immediately [invaded Ukraine](https://news.yahoo.com/russia-invades-ukraine-151324360.html) in the middle of last week. It's been at least 3 days since the invasion started and Kyiv has yet to fall. [Putin is reportedly frustrated](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/russia-e2-80-98frustrated-e2-80-99-by-e2-80-98very-determined-e2-80-99-ukrainian-resistance/ar-AAUlCFX) at the amount of resistance and the slow pace of the invasion. The Ukrainian president (and many of the residents) refuse to be cowed. Russia [vetoes a UN security council resolution condemning the invasion](https://www.reuters.com/world/russia-vetoes-un-security-action-ukraine-china-abstains-2022-02-25/), surprising nobody but also showcasing how ridiculous the security council is. Almost everyone immediately condemned the invasion ([even the effing Taliban](https://news.yahoo.com/even-taliban-wants-russia-ukraine-130608474.html)!) and the West has responded with sanctions as expected, including [cutting Russian banks off from SWIFT](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/27/russian-banks-excluded-from-swift-what-we-know-so-far). [Even the Russians are protesting](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/world/europe/russia-protests-putin.html). There's just so much stuff and so many people are opining about WTH Putin is thinking. Here's to hoping Putin/Russia sees some sense and the crisis is resolved quickly.
- PH: [Covid cases continue to stay low, and our positivity rate has returned to the WHO benchmark of 5%](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1497844104872738817). They are considering whether to drop Metro Manila to the lowest alert level this week.

### My Week

- I had a week full of errands, family birthday celebrations, and poor sleeping habits.
- I accompanied my mom to the hospital last Thursday for a routine procedure that she has done twice a year. I found myself once again seething at the sheer inefficiency of many institutions. First, she had to take an antigen test. That was fine; she needed to sit in a room for an hour with a bunch of other immunocompromised people so that's understandable. When we asked how long it would take, the nurse we spoke to said the test results would be out in 1 to 4 hours (!!) but if we needed it immediately it could be done in 15-20 minutes. Then why the heck is 1-4 hours an option?!? It ended up taking the better part of an hour for them to do the actual test and give us the results. So much for "rapid" testing. After that we set her up in the room for the procedure and after a few minutes the nurse gave me the statement to take to the billing department for processing and payment. Dealing with this department in this particular hospital always pisses me off because for some reason they always take a ridiculously long time to process a very simple bill. This time was no different; I patiently waited for 45 minutes before following up and they were like "Sir, we just need to print it", which took another 15 mins! Sigh. As if we didn't need more reasons to dislike going to the hospital! I had also been extra cranky during the trip because I had to wake up earlier than usual to go, so it was a credit to my patience that I remained polite and didn't explode in anger at anyone there.
- This past week was the 36th anniversary of the EDSA revolution; I wrote [some words about EDSA and historical revisionism](/2022/02/edsa36/).
- **Gaming**:
    - Ongoing: 
        - **Tales of Vesperia** (Steam): Finally had my fill of post-game content and started a New Game+ run! This might still take a while though it's definitely faster than the first run.
        - Still enjoying **Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair**, though some of the stages make me dizzy for some reason. I am close to finishing all the stages; after that there will be the actual Impossible Lair itself then completion stuff.
    - Ongoing Card games: 
        - [Magic Arena](/tags/MagicArena/): I did a lot of [Neon Dynasty drafts](/tags/mtgneo) in prep for this weekend's Arena Open, which unfortunately did not go so well. Still really enjoying the limited format though! You can view all my Neon Dynasty limited bloopers at [the Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXhLIY5zAbmQn-tSxCE5RWgs).
        - [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame/): Managed to [hit Master rank in Expedition](/2022/02/1497136051298570244/) a few days early, that means I get a mastery token for next month's open! Hopefully that goes better than the Arena one did!
    - Ongoing Fighting games: Still playing the occasional **Street Fighter V** match. Capcom [announced Street Fighter 6 last weekend](https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2022/feb/20/street-fighter-6-announce/)! That's at least a year away though.
- **Watching**:
    - Movies: For some reason I decided to watch [Sum of All Fears (2022)](/2022/02/a370090670a1a8b0e2adf4aa6156a412/) this week, coincidentally right around the time Russia decided to invade Ukraine. Sorry if that was my fault.
    - **TV:** 
        - Wrote [some words about Peacemaker](/2022/02/peacemaker/).
        - Actually didn't watch a lot of TV this week.
        - Behind: **Legends of Tomorrow**, **Young Justice**, **Superman and Lois**, **NCIS**, **Star Trek Discovery**
        - Yet to start: **Cobra Kai season 4**
- **Reading**: Haven't started a new book yet.
- **Trivia**: Still doing our regular Discord crossword sessions, you can follow along via [the YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5c1J8DcHGjdqIys0p6qboROtUX7mKTK5). (some Filipino slips in here and there, but most of it should be in English.) The videos also feature us trying out some random other games like [Wiki History Quiz](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/), [Countdown](https://incoherency.co.uk/countdown/practice/), [Semantle](https://semantle.novalis.org/) (ugh), and of course the NYT spelling bee, among others. Feel free to like, subscribe and all that jazz.

### This coming week:

- **The Batman** is showing in theaters this week! We are still considering whether to go and watch Day 1, something I haven't done since 2019!
