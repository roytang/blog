Finished watching Peacemaker last week. This is the HBO Max spinoff series starring John Cena's character from [The Suicide Squad (2021)](/2021/08/the-suicide-squad/). It's a wild, witty, irreverent, violent and totally-not-for-kids ride. James Gunn once again has managed to take an obscure comic book character and wring a good amount of story out of him.

The show has this ridiculous opening sequence which has the main cast doing a choreographed dance. It follows directly after the events of **The Suicide Squad** (there is a short recap). In-between all the craziness, the show manages to make some commentary on important issues such as climate change, racism, misogyny, capitalism, the cloud, sarcasm, Ariana Gradne, and good powerpoint presentations. 

One of the characters is an eagle! This is the only show where you get to see an eagle hug a man. Also, the Terminator is here! Not Arnold, the one from T2. Almost didn't recognize him because he's so old now. I think most of the episodes have something in the post-credits sequences.

There is [a gag reel available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXji_udtNyI), if you like that sort of thing.
