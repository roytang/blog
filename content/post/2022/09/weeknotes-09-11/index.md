### Bits and Pieces

- The big news this past week is the passing of Queen Elizabeth II, Britain's longest reigning monarch. She is succeeded by Charles III. And I think a lot of Brits discovered how many people on the internet weren't too fond of either their beloved monarch or their history of colonialism.

- **PH/Covid**: Cases seem to have plateaued, instead of continuing to go down as I'd hoped. In fact, there is even [a slight uptick in the NCR positivity rate](https://twitter.com/iamguidodavid/status/1568795127849820162), possibly due to the reopening of face to face classes a couple of weeks ago. Hopefully we don't get into a big surge.

- Last night I stayed up late to get updates on the Marvel/LucasArts announcements at D23. Some new trailers for upcoming D+ series were released. Nothing too exciting; most of the juicy stuff was kept as exclusive footage for on-site attendees. A lot of people were disappointed with the lack of FF casting news or new film announcements.
  
- This weekend I also worked a bit on some updates to the site's backend processing, but I made a deployment mistake and left some batch jobs processing while resetting the indexes which resulted in a flood of tweets and toots from me on Twitter and Mastodon. [Took me a while to clean up the mess!](/2022/09/616a3e6a91df76eb443d70cdb0e16bc8/)

- **Gaming**: I think I'm around halfway through **SMT5** (on Switch). Also still playing **Paradise Killer** (via PC Game Pass), but I have no idea if I'm doing well. Just normal grinding in [Eternal Card Game](/tags/EternalCardGame). Been drafting [Dominaria United](/tags/mtgdmu) on [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena/), here's [a Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXjDp5OtgSFBDvL8BwPo6mCq). The week started out well for DMU drafts and **Street Fighter V** in terms of winning, but that quickly soured and the second half of the week was terrible; hopefully I can turn things around this coming week.

- Speaking of streaming, some friends convinced me to try streaming [Words on Stream](https://wos.gg/) on Twitch. It was fun, but we couldn't get too far, probably because I don't have that many viewers!

- **Media Diet**: Last week I finished reading [Maskerade](/2022/09/maskerade/) (a [Discworld](/topics/discworld) book ) and also managed to [watch 3 movies](/2022/09/nausica-maverick-gamenight/).

### This coming week:

- I think Tokyo Game Show is next week, but I'm not looking forward to anything specific there I think. Maybe expect some new SF6 news?
