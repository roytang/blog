A couple of months ago I got access to the [DALL-E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E), an AI/machine learning model that lets you generate images from natural language descriptions. Basically they have a server they run and you get some limited number of credits per month (?) to generate images. I only got around to trying it last week and posted some of my samples in [the most recent weeknotes](/2022/08/weeknotes-08-28/).

Since then, I feel like there's a spike in the number of AI image generation-related news and articles I encounter. (More likely than not, I just notice them more now that I've actually played with it a bit.) There are other such tools available like [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) (similar to DALL-E, running on its own server) and the recently-released [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion), which is open source and you can run it on those PC. Admittedly I don't have a lot of experience with these tools yet, but I thought I'd write down some initial thoughts so that I can maybe look back at them down the line.

#### How are artists affected?

I guess the first thing to ask is: should artists be threatened by this sort of tech? Will it take away their livelihoods? (I must note that even though I consider [sketching](/tags/albums) a hobby, I don't really consider myself an artist; not one with any level of skill at least.)

Here's one artist who isn't worried: [Why Dall-E will not steal my job as an illustrator](https://emmanuel6.medium.com/why-dall-e-will-not-steal-my-job-6a1e2943cb82). 

He also makes some excellent points about how even in various fields where automation can do what humans do, there is still some space for the field to survive. Although the problem is that economics around art may start to change. There will always be a space for people to create art themselves and to enjoy art created by humans, but for commercial purposes, why pay an artist so much if the AI-assisted tools become good enough or cheap enough as an alternative? There may still be a demand for hand-made ("artisanal"?) art, but for many commercial endeavors the demand for human artists may lessen. 

On the other hand, these tools seem like they might end up enabling new kinds of artists as well. An interesting article related to this is: [4.2 Gigabytes, or: How to Draw Anything](https://andys.page/posts/how-to-draw/). It describes a process where even with very little drawing skill, you can layout an image using simple tools like MSPaint, and use the AI tools to enhance it into a much more detailed or realistic drawing. While a professional artist probably still has an advantage in this regard (since he would know more about things like lighting and composition, etc), these tools can democratize the space a bit, allowing people who previously would not have been able to generate such types of art to do so. 

I think the closest analogy is to photography, which was also mentioned in the post from Emmanuel above: even though phone cameras have made it so that anyone can take pictures anywhere, there is still a demand for professional photographers, since their skill means they know how to take better shots, find better angles etc.

One thing to note is that these tools require a great deal of specificity - if you have a certain concept or idea of the art already in your head, you need to be very specific in your descriptions/prompts to get something close to that, and that may not always be possible. And the less you speak the language of art, the more difficult it may be for you.

A likely future may be that artists and illustrators survive as a profession, adapting these tools into their workflows to make stages like prototyping and iteration easier/faster, while still requiring their skill for final touchups or adjustments and such.

#### Can we even use this training data?

Another big question right now about these AI content generation tools is the ethics behind using other people's works as part of the training data set. Andy Baio gave a quick overview of the ethics concerns here: [Opening the Pandoraâ€™s Box of AI Art](https://waxy.org/2022/08/opening-the-pandoras-box-of-ai-art/). It's certainly a complex question both legally and ethically.

One thing to note is that the AI learns from the training data much the same way a human artist does - the human artist looks at and studies lots and lots of images over the course of his life/career and he mimics and learns from them and blends them all into what his own personal style becomes. If I had the discipline to draw a comic book, doubtless the style would be some combination of the many comic artists whose works I have enjoyed through the years. We all learn from those who come before us; these tools simply make that process happen a whole lot faster.
