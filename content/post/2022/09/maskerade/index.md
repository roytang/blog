**Maskerade** is Discworld book no. 18, from the Witches subseries. Took me a couple of weeks to get through this one, on and off. It's a combination murder mystery/investigation and parody of opera-related tropes. The exploits and schemes of Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg are always welcome, but I would have probably appreciated this more if I was into the Phantom of the Opera. Not my favorite of the series.

After this one, I only have one more physical Discworld book I haven't read. (Which implies it's time to look for some more...)

Side note: I really like this particular cover artist for the Discworld books. The book says it's Josh Kirby. Not sure if it's a coincidence, but all my paper Discworld books from the Witches subseries have his covers.
