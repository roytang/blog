Notes:

- Since HBG isn't a standard set, I didn't play as many events as I usually do.
- Managed a couple of 7s, but my win rate for this set was a bit lower than usual.
- The set wasn't very color-balanced (blue was notably weaker). They corrected this later with Alchemy rebalances for the draft format, but all of the events I played were before the rebalancing. Honestly, it might have been better to experience the first-ever limited rebalancing, but I just didn't have the time/resources for it.
