I just came back from a pretty good 5-day out of town trip via a miserable 9-hour bus ride, so this past week's weeknotes are coming in late and will probably be a bit short.

### The World

- Former Japanese PM Shinzo Abe has been assassinated. Noahpinion has [a pretty good writeup on how he changed Japan](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/the-japan-that-abe-shinzo-made).
- Amid multiple crises, [the people of Sri Lanka have ousted their prime minister via wide-scale protests](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/07/09/asia/sri-lanka-protest-president-saturday-intl-hnk/index.html). Hopefully they learn from certain other countries' mistakes manage to stop his children from coming back in 30 years to revise history.
- Speaking of mistakes, [our president has been diagnosed positive for Covid](https://www.manilatimes.net/2022/07/09/news/national/marcos-tests-positive-for-covid-19/1850225). It is 11 days into his administration and the pandemic is still ongoing and we still do not have a health secretary. Daily cases continue to inch upwards, albeit hospitalizations are still low and generally mild.

### My Week

- As mentioned, I was out of the house most of the week. Will probably write about the trip sometime later this week.


### Media Diet

I did manage to watch some stuff this week though.

- #### Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (2020)

    - I finally watched this because it kept coming up in our quiz nights. When I first heard of it, I thought it was some sort of documentary. Turns out it's a comedy film starring Will Ferell and Rachel McAdams. The story is okay and the performances are pretty good. Some of the comedy bits seem unnecessary and/or go on way too long, perhaps a typical problem with Will Ferell films.

- #### Porco Rosso (1982)

    - Beautifully animated, as with all ghibli films. I thought it was going to be a war film, but it was really more of a duel about romance. Pretty good!

- #### The Boys season 3

    - Some good episodes in there, but I feel like the finale landed a bit flat for me. The season overall was okay, maybe not as good as season 2? Anthony Starr as Homelander continues to be one of the best-acted villains in television, esepcially in any scene where he is able to portray that seething insanity barely being kept in check. [The Boys subreddit was recently in chaos](https://twitter.com/broderick/status/1538164628882178048) because apparently many right wing fans didn't realize Homelander was actually a bad guy!


### This coming week:

- **Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate** dropped on Magic Arena this week and **Thor: Love and Thunder** is in the theaters, but I was out so I have not yet had the time to enjoy them. Will probably start streaming HBG this week and watch Thor soon.
- The **2022 GMTK game jam** is next weekend and I plan to participate! I haven't done any gamedev in a while, so I hope I'm not too rusty!
