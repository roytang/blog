### The World

- Our local covid cases continue to tick upwards, albeit a bit slowly, and the health care utilization rate still holds at low values. Positivity rates are climbing though, especially in NCR, so the "real" case counts are probably a bit higher. If I had to I would guess the current "surge" peaks in maybe 2-3 weeks.
- Tomorrow is president BBM's first state of the nation address. It's a big brouhaha I hope to ignore completely.
- Earlier today, there was a shooting incident at Ateneo de Manila. Three people died. It was a politically-motivated assassination attempt in broad daylight at a graduation ceremony at one of the most prestigious universities in the country. For me, this reflects [the state of the nation](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1551163175738884096) more than anything the president might say tomorrow: impunity, violence, and politically divided.
- Our friends in the US and Europe experienced record-high temperatures during the past week. I learned that when places like UK have a "heat wave", the temperature literally spikes for a day or two at a time; it's not like over here where the temperature is just constantly high during summer, so they are less acclimatized to the heat. And a lot of their infra isn't built to handle the soaring temps; [they even had some melting runways](https://twitter.com/Joyce_Karam/status/1549040174939934720)! It's gotten so bad lately that Steam and Nintendo had to put out advisories that the [Steam Deck](https://screenrant.com/steam-deck-temperature-warning-heat-wave/) and [the Switch](https://www.yahoo.com/now/nintendo-gives-warning-switch-hot-115522740.html) might not be able to withstand the high temps!

### Some Links of Interest

All I have for you today is [this interesting Twitter thread about how Etsy's homepages worked back in the mid-2000s](https://twitter.com/mcfunley/status/1550219636464967680). (Well, interesting for software folk I guess!)

### My Week

- On the blog: I wrote about [failing to finish a game jam](/2022/07/gmtk-jam-2022-failed/) and also [my out of town trip from a couple of weeks ago](/2022/07/five-days-in-naga/).
- This week I mostly holed up at home, outside of my regular daily walks. 
- Woke up early today to catch the details from Marvel's Hall H presentation at SDCC as they came out. Bunch of new stuff, plans for phases 5 and 6. New trailers for [She-Hulk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7JsKhI2An0) and [Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlOB3UALvrQ). A lot of people already have Marvel fatigue, but as a long-time comic book fan, I'm still very much invested! The weekend also gave us new trailers for [Shazam: Fury of the Gods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwFOa3qV5Sk) and [Black Adam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBjpXbaIu70)! Also: I know it's a long shot, but I'm hoping [this panel from Secret Invasion # 5](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1551174220884742144) (published almost 14 years ago) makes it in!
- Speaking of comic books, I've found myself reading more of the Marvel back catalog lately via the Marvel Unlimited app. I've been subscribed for a while, but haven't been using it too extensively before. This week I read a lot of old comics from the 60s and 70s (Iron Man, Avengers, Daredevil, etc) and it crossed my mind: what if I attempt to read EVERY MARVEL COMIC?!? This is of course [not unheard of](/2022/01/i-read-all-27000-marvel-comics-and-had-a-great-time-heres-what-i-learnt/) so it's definitely doable, but would probably take a while. Latest estimates have the total number of published issues at around 30,000. I figure if I read say 50 comics a week (in addition to whatever was published that week), that's around 2,500 per year, so I can clear the backlog in around 12 years, which doesn't sound too bad! In actuality, I've already read a decent chunk of that 30k backlog, so I would guess it would only be 8-9 years maybe for me. Fifty comics a week is maybe ten comics a day on weekdays, which is definitely manageable and won't take too much of my time. The real problem is I would be adding yet another backlog to my already extensive backlogs of games, books, side projects, and other things I really should get around to.
- Wrapped up my streaming of **Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate** on Magic Arena this past week. I started strong but the finale was terrible. You can see all my drafts via the [site tag](/tags/mtghbg/) or [the youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXiNdvKYckxA3BpKjf2CjfCi)
- This week I started playing **Shin Megami Tensei V** on Nintendo Switch. This game certainly has a vibe.

### Media Diet

Not a lot this week.

- #### Se7en (1995)

    - Been meaning to watch this for a while, mostly so I can understand all the "What's in the box?" references. Excellent thriller film with a very young Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow. Morgan Freeman gives a great performance as the grizzled and tired veteran cop on the verge of retirement. Was surprised to see Kevin Spacey, who a friend of mine says was unfortunately "typecast into being an asshole". One of my trivia friends insists the movie should always be referred to by the stylized title "Se7en". 

- #### The Flash season 8

    - I think I finished watching this a couple of weeks ago and forgot to write about it. I guess the season finale just didn't register with me. Not a fan of the season. It was just so bad, with a lot of handwaved sci-fi nonsense and way too much CW drama. (To be fair, the Flash comics also have a lot of handwaved sci-fi nonsense...). I really should just give up this show now that Legends is canned and Superman and Lois are confirmed non-Arrowverse, there's no more reason to be following it. But there's a very good chance the next season is the final one, so I might as well watch it since I've already come this far? (Sunk cost fallacy much?) Maybe I'll just wait til it's done then binge it lol.

### This coming week:

- Trivia team is planning to attend another face to face quiz night this Thursday. I am still wary of the rising Covid cases, but will probably go.
- Next weekend will be a bit busy for my card games: Eternal and Arena both have limited opens I want to play in! New Explorer and Historic Anthologies are also scheduled to drop on Arena this week, but I probably won't get into those immediately.
