- The week has been a bit busy, and I don't have a lot of time today, so these weeknotes will be a bit short.

- The year nears it's midpoint, and it seems like the world continues to regress.

- A couple of the days ago, as prophesized by an earlier leak, the US Supreme Court struck down the 50-year old Roe vs Wade precedent, clearing the way for multiple states to almost immediately ban abortions. I am neither an American nor a woman, so I do not feel I have the standing to weigh in. In fact, as someone who grew up as and is still a practicing Catholic, in theory I do not approve of abortions. But that doesn't mean I should get to impose my beliefs on those who share them, especially when their health and well-being are on the line. This feels like it should be common sense.

- Covid19 cases are on the rise in the country, most of them centered around the NCR. Positivity rates are holding barely below the 5% threshold. Luckily, hospital utilization rates are staying low, so it generally looks like a "mild" surge. Hopefully everyone stays masked up and more people get vaccinated and boosted to keep things under control.

### My Week

- More errands this week, some of the medical nature (both for myself and for family members), and some prep for an upcoming trip to the province.
- I [wrote a bit about Lab Tests](/2022/06/lab-tests/), basically an example of my recent errands over the past few weeks.
- **Gaming**: Triangle Strategy NG+ run is about 75% done. [I finished Bloodstained](/2022/06/bloodstained/)! Regular Eternal and Arena daily grinding continues. 

### Media Diet

- #### Obi-wan Kenobi

    - This series had some problems, and one might question whether this was even a story that needed to be told, but they pretty much stuck the landing. That final confrontation between Ben and Anakin was something special. Another great entry into the "grumpy old man travelling with a sassy child" genre.

### This coming week:

- It's going to be July! 
- Should be one final batch of family errands this coming week, then the week after I will be out of town on a trip. 
- This Thursday, I may attend my first in-person quiz night since the pandemic began. ("May" because I'm still monitoring the local Covid situation closely.)
