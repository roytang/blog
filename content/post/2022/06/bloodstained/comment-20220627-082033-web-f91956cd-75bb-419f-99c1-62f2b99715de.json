  "text": "I played in on Steam; I didn't notice any particular performance problems unless I was running something heavy in the background.\r\n\r\nI do agree with movement seeming stiff; at the start of the game I felt like something was off about Miriam's jump arc, and sliding definitely felt stiff. I think I just got used to it as the game progressed and my movement options improved.\r\n\r\nI remember enjoying the NDS castlevanias, but I only played through each of them once and that was over 15 years ago so I can barely remember the details now. Maybe Bloodstained is lucky I can't really directly compare them!",
