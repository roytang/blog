- Another exhausting, errand-filled week for me. For some reason being human means limited amounts of time and energy to do all the things I want to do.

- Covid19 cases are starting to go up again in these parts, which is threatening some end-of-month plans I had. I think most people aren't paying the rise in cases any heed, but I have to be extra cautious given that I live with a couple of seniors. We'll see how it goes.

- Markets are crashing, crypto is crashing, no safe place to put your investments at the moment. Cash is king.

- [Support for Microsoft's Internet Explorer has ended.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/announcements/internet-explorer-11-end-of-support) I was surprised it was actually still supported in Windows 10 before this week. I spent most of my early professional web development years exclusively in IE (See: [Tales from the Old Web (Development)](/2020/02/old-web/)), so it's a bit of a bittersweet moment. Most of those early years were spent working on bespoke web applications used internally by large organizations and government departments, and I have no doubt that no small number of such users are now worried that all of their legacy "compatible-only-with-IE" backend systems are about to become obsolete.

- I spent an inordinate amount of time waiting around in hospital corridors this past week, and I noticed the following warning posted in several places:

    {{% img src="cyberlibel.jpg" %}}

    ... which seems ridiculous on its face, given that in theory "cyberlibel" as a crime should only be applicable to things that are proven to be maliciously false. I mean, recording other patients is obviously problematic for medical privacy reasons, and it would be fine if the warning just said it was against hospital policy, but to threaten "cyberlibel"? I think there was some sort of scandal a while back about a video captured of nurses/doctors making fun of a patient or something like that? So I suspect these warnings are a bit of an overreaction to that.

### My Week

- My only other blog post this past week was [my Streets of New Capenna limited recap](/2022/06/mtgsnc-limited-recap/).
- **Gaming**: Triangle Strategy NG+ run is about 40% done. Close to finishing Bloodstained as well. ([Streamed a bit of it even](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBbY1VKEWl0).) Regular Eternal and Arena daily grinding continues. Also recently bought the Jaws of the Lion DLC for Gloomhaven, a coop game I have been enjoying with my Saturday gaming group.
- Someone has been uploading regular videos of our crossword sessions again to [the trivia group's Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww), if you like that kind of thing. Like, subscribe, all that jazz.

### Media Diet

#### Unlocked by John Scalzi

A few weeks back, the [Tor eBook club](https://ebookclub.tor.com/) gave for free a trio of sci-fi novellas, combined into one eBook. The first one was [Psalm for the Wild-Built, which I wrote about last week.](/2022/06/weeknotes-06-12/#a-psalm-for-the-wild-built-by-becky-chambers) This was the second one, with the full title **Unlocked: An Oral History of Haden's Syndrome**. I didn't know anything about going in, and only read it because I was stuck for a while in a hospital waiting room with poor cell signal so I needed offline entertainment, and I already had that some eBook file open on the iBooks app, so why not? It's about a mysterious disease that appeared suddenly and without warning and quickly spread all over the world; this sounded familiar! So I wondered whether Scalzi had written before or after 2020, and it turns out it was actually released in 2014 as a sort of prequel novella to a book he had called Lock-In. This novella describes how the status quo of that book came to be, and it's written as a series of interview transcripts with different people involved in the pandemic response and the development of the eventual solution. This is my first Scalzi book (though I think I've actually been following him on social media for a while), and I did find it reasonably good and it was short enough for me to finish during the two-hour wait. Though I suppose the format means I won't necessarily enjoy his more normal works. Still, it has made me a bit more interested!

#### Young Justice: Phantoms

Season four of Young Justice was okay, but I felt like maybe had one or two too many subplots to follow. I might have been confused because I probably missed an episode or two somewhere in the middle, but I did enjoy how everything was resolved and looking forward to Kara Zor-El in the next season!

#### Ongoing TV Status (all caught up!)

The Flash season 8, The Boys season 3, Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, The Orville season 3, Superman and Lois, Obi-wan Kenobi, Ms Marvel


### This coming week:

Yet another bunch of errands to do, such is life. Then there's an Eternal open next weekend, but it's Expedition format, and I don't have a deck for that yet, so IDK if I'm playing. I think Obiwan is ending next week. Hoping the Covid cases don't go up too quickly or maybe even start trending down?!? I want to write more on this blog! (There are a lot of things I want to do more of!)
