title: My Streets of New Capenna Limited Recap

Notes:

- SNC was not a particularly balanced limited format; like many people I did best when playing with white or blue. Whenever I strayed outside of those colors, I was punished for my insolence.
- My sealed win rates were also much worse than my draft win rates by far.
- I thought about trying out the Alchemy SNC drafts as well, but figured it was better to save my resources for when *Alchemy Horizons: Baldur's Gate* comes out in July.
- I did enjoy the format, balance problems notwithstanding, and my overall win rate was still a bit above my average
