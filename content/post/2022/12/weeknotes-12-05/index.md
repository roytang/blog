Weeknotes coming in late even for a Monday; last couple of days have been busy.

### The World

- I will admit I kind of zoned out on the world this week. I think Elon was still doing his shenanigans? Like getting into a fight with Apple then almost immediately backing off? And also threatening to drop a bombshell about Hunter Biden that turned out to be a big nothingburger? It should be illegal to get into more than one shenanigan per week, but then again Elon might just ignore that law if it existed.

- Also apparently [San Francisco authorized their cops to use killer robots?!?](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63816454)

- For some reason I think the World Cup is still going on?!?


### My Week

- This week was a lot less busy than last week. Kind of a lazy week actually, though I did get some end-of-month errands in and even some fixes on side projects. This week's notes will not be too long.
  
- I did spend a nontrivial amount of time reinstalling stuff on [the new desktop I got together last weekend](/2022/12/pc-build-2022/). Everything is more or less fine now, although I'm sure there are still a lot of old files to clean up and probably in a week or so I'll realize I've forgotten to install something.

- Sunday: My eldest niece's birthday was last week, so we had family over for Sunday lunch and four of the *pamangkins* were in the house for most of the afternoon. As the eldest *tito*, it fell to me to keep them busy and entertained. This involved copious amounts of cartoons, a mess of toys, Roblox sessions, horseplay, and worrying about whether they will break some of [the Transformers](/tags/transformers) they found in my room.

- Monday (today): Spent most of the afternoon in a weekday badminton session with the brothers, which meant hanging out with the same kids again!

- On the blog: [Tried out the new OpenAI chat bot ChatGPT](/2022/12/chatgpt/).

- **Gaming**: 
    - I [did a Street Fighter V stream last Monday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUb-Uj_CgeA&t=43s) to test the new streaming setup. Still putting together some stuff for the eventual blog post about the game.
    - Still playing some card games on the regular: 
        - [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame): Just regular grinding still. Honestly a bit tempted to maybe drop Eternal again for a while, as I've not really done well in the opens and the formats seem a bit stale (would also give me more time for other stuff). Maybe I'll wait for the next set to drop first before deciding on that.
        - [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena): Managed to stream some Brothers War Limited again this week, though just [the one session](/2022/12/mtgbro_draft_ep4/). Still struggling with the format, good runs remain elusive, hopefully I can figure it out soon. Also wrote [the Limited Recap post for Dominaria United](/2022/12/mtgdmu-limited-recap/).
        - [Marvel Snap](/2022/10/1585610936563519493/). Griiindy!!
    - Still trying to power through **SMT5**, I feel like I'm close to the end though. Hopefully!

### Media Diet

- I got access to Disney+ PH and was immediately overwhelmed with all the stuff I want to watch. I thought I wouldn't have much to look forward to on the service, but I was wrong. There's a bunch of old shows I never completed before (*Scrubs*, *White Collar*, *Homeland*, *Clone Wars*, etc), old shows I wouldn't mind rewatching (*The Simpsons*, *Futurama*, etc), shows I've heard good things about but never seen (*Andor*, *Atlanta*, *Legion*, etc) and so on. And there's even movies too! It's hard to decide what to watch first, and I basically doubled my backlog of shows/movies I want to watch, and most likely not enough time to watch everything. That doesn't mean we won't try! (I often wish I had a [Room of Spirit of Time](https://dragonballuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Room_of_Spirit_and_Time) to do all the stuff I wanted to do.)

- (I am already midway through *Andor* as of this writing.)


### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot today:

- [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory/): A blog directory!

- [All My Blogs Are Dead - The Awl](https://www.theawl.com/2015/02/all-my-blogs-are-dead/): Even when writing for third-party sites, you should still archive your writings somewhere else when possible.
