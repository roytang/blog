### Overview and Timeline

A few weeks ago, I finally hit achievement completion in Street Fighter V! 

Quick review: Despite the game getting some poor reviews at the start, I think it has grown into a pretty good entry in the franchise.

It's been a long and challenging road, mainly because despite [my love of fighting games](/2019/08/fighting-games/), I am so so bad at them, so I never thought I would be able to overcome the achievements that required me to rank up online, but somehow through perseverence I got there!

A timeline!

- 2015: [Played the SFV demo at EGX](/2015/09/egx/)
- 2016: [Played in open beta](#10154341976808912)
- Jan 2016: Purchased SFV on Steam
- Feb 2016: Refunded SFV on Steam (lol)
- Feb 2016: [Purchased SFV on PS4!](#BB1oNI4soNi)
- Jan 2017: Purchased SFV + character pass seasons 1 and 2 on Steam. Double dip!
- Mar 2021: [Ranked up to Silver for the first time!](#1374367400276025345)
- May 2022: [Ranked up to Super Silver for the first time!](#1524382403296333824)
- Oct 2022: [Ranked up to Ultra Silver for the first time!](#1582700303526531073)
- Oct 2022: After 6 days, [ranked up to Gold for the first time!](#1585237402192601089) This was the final online ranked achievement needed.
- Nov 2022: [Achievement completion!](#1591033088699961344)

This timeline shows just how long it took me to rank up, although things cascaded quickly in the second half of 2022. I touch upon this in the post linked above (and in a video I will link below), but the reasons I am so bad at Street Fighter despite playing it since the 90s basically come down to [poor reaction time](/2014/11/529271403191603200/), poor execution skills (which could in theory be overcome with lots of practice and labwork, except...see next item), and an unwillingness to spend time practicing and doing labwork in training mode. 

SFV is the first entry in the franchise where I really played a lot online. I did play SFIV online a bit, but due to a combination of our internet not being great at the time and the execution barrier being really hard for me in that game and the achievements being insane, I was never able to play too regularly. SFV had the advantage of me already having fiber internet and even in this third world country I could usually find something like 3-5 opponents a night easily, something I managed to do pretty regularly over the past year or so.

I've tried a whole bunch of mains, but [in Sep 2021 I shifted to using Birdie as main](#1437762927289720837) and didn't look back. He is now by far my most played character. I liked playing Birdie because he's kind of slow and lumbering and I felt like I could use him to overcome my weaknesses in reaction time and execution. He has a quick and easy to execute anti-air (crucial for getting out of bronze!) and some zoning tricks and command grab tricks and an easy two-hit punish that even someone like me could use. My winrate with Birdie isn't great though (49%); my best winrate was with Cody, but I think I never got him past Bronze and didn't feel like his style was good enough for me to try ranking up too much.

### Stats (requires JavaScript)

It took me a few weeks to put this post together because I love stats and therefore I wanted to try to extract my fighter profile stats from both PS4 and Steam versions and even spent some time looking for an API or whatever but no luck, I ended up just noting things manually in a spreadsheet. Then I wanted to make an interactive stats table with filters, so here we are!

The stats table below can be filtered by platform (Steam, PS4 or Both). I played the game on PS4 up to the early parts of season 2, then Steam the rest of the way, so these stats (especially the overall matchup encounter rate) reflect those periods.

Some notes from these stats:

- Birdie was my most played character by a mile
- Cody was the only one with a positive winrate!
- on both platforms, Ryu and Ken are the top 2 most common opponents on the ranked ladder (with Akuma placing third on Steam because he only appeared in season 2). People love their shotos! It's why I eventually changed mains from Ryu to Balrog in 2021, I just felt like everybody always knew how to play against Ryu because he was so common!
- Opponents I *really* had trouble with: M Bison, Lucia. I just didn't understand how to get in close to them to deal my damage without getting beaten up!

<div id="stats">

        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

### Other stuff

- [The One Street Fighter V Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUb-Uj_CgeA): Hourlong stream of me derping around in ranked and talking about SFV, from a couple of weeks ago. I talk about some of the stuff I mentioned above.
- [My Street Fighter V playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXhfW7UoMLQV_HiHQ4YtKJfU): Aside from the video above, a bunch of videos of me actually fighting.
- [The Street Fighter V tag on this site](/tags/streetfighterv/)
- Screenshots from PS4 and Steam attached to this post (see below).

Now that I've written this blog post, I plan to uninstall the game! I had a lot of fun with it, but it's time to move on. Just in time for Street Fighter 6 coming out next year! Now that [I have a new desktop](/2022/12/pc-build-2022/), I signed up for the SF6 closed beta later this month, hopefully I can get in! And hopefully I can be better at SF6 than this one!

#### 2026

Updating this post in 2026 to note some stuff:

- I moved most of the screenshots into [a screenshots album in the collections section](/collections/albums/sfv/)
- I never did unlock all the characters in this game. From the screenshot below, I have not unlocked:
    - Season 3: Falke, G
    - Season 4: Gill, Kage, Lucia, Poison, Seth
    - Season 5: Rose, Dan, Oro
    - I kind of wish I had access to these characters to putz around with now long after SF5's heyday, but I'm not sure I wanna pay for those DLCs. In theory I could unlock each character individually using Fight Money (which is how I have some of them already unlocked), but I only have a bit less than 50k FM right now, and each one of those characters costs 100k FM to unlock, and weekly missions give pitiful amounts of FM (I think there's 2 each week that give 500FM each, then the rest give 50FM?), so that would kind of take YEARS. Maybe at some point in the future Capcom will make it cheaper to unlock them!
    - That being said, I do think the Fight Money system from SF5 is a bit better than the system in SF6 where my only option to access DLC characters is really just paying for the season pass. It looks like for SF5 (Steam) I paid for season passes 1 and 2 then just selectively unlocked characters from seasons 3-5 using FM.
- My favorte costume in this game (shown in the screenshots below), is a crossover costume for Cammy from the main character Fiona from the PS2 Capcom game [Haunting Ground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haunting_Ground). And of course Cody's prisoner costume, the one costume in the game I paid for.
