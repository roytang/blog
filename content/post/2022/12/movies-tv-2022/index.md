This is a compilation of movie/TV reviews from 2022 that were not otherwise included in other posts.

### Movies

#### Pig (2021)

<time id="9f334e2bc092614079ecd191f947c4ff">[2022-01-07 20:51] </time>

From the description, I expected some kind of John Wick-style revenge action film; that was nowhere near correct. The film defies expectations at almost every turn, going in directions I never expected. <!--sep-->It feels like to explain the film would be to ruin it, so I won't. It is pretty good, and we get a serious Cage performance in this one.

#### Tick, Tick... Boom! (2021)

<time id="2ffc2893357aca5b3cbf7d27510ade9c">[2022-01-14 00:53] </time>

Watched this so I could widen my horizons with a musical. Surprised to learn it was based on a real-life musical and on a real person. The songs were pretty good. Andrew Garfield gave a great performance.

#### Sum of All Fears (2002)

<time id="a370090670a1a8b0e2adf4aa6156a412">[2022-02-24 08:00] </time>

Watched this last night, since it was the last Jack Ryan movie I hadn't seen yet. (Coulda sworn it wasn't on Prime Video last year). It was ok. Ben Affleck's performance wasn't outstanding or anything, and the setup in the first half took a bit too long and was mostly just people talking and such, but the action-thriller part in the second half was good. I can see how releasing this in the climate less than a year after 9/11 might have been problematic though.

#### Drive (2011)

<time id="drive">[2022-03-03 13:37] </time>

Last night I wanted to watch a movie and settled on Drive (2011), mostly because of Carey Mulligan, who I really only knew from [Blink](/2012/10/255642233682939904/). This film went from slow burn to sudden, graphic violence real quick. The protagonist hardly says anything. Very neo-noir. The director lingers on every shot, letting the audience soak up the mood. I feel like Ryan Gosling here is playing the same type of character he was in [Blade Runner 2046](/2021/12/movies-tv-sep-dec-2021/#blade-runner-2049-2017), but I haven't seen enough of his movies to know if that's typical for his range. The film isn't really about driving cars, although it has a couple of good driving sequences.

#### Free Guy (2021)

<time id="08a99408e883fc81ddbd4c0d84fbbf6f">[2022-03-04 16:29] </time>

Watched Free Guy (2021) today on a whim. This film is way better than I expected it to be, given the premise. A fun romp, with decent performances by Ryan Reynolds and Jodie comer (who I had previously only seen in [The Last Duel](/2021/12/movies-tv-sep-dec-2021/#the-last-duel-2021)). A fun popcorn flick!

---

#### Bullet Train

<time id="bullet-train">[2022-10-23 00:01] </time>

Watched *Bullet Train* tonight. Was quite entertaining. I came in not knowing anything that wasn't in the very first trailer. A colorful action film with some fun twists and surprising cameos. I really liked the soundtrack too, especially Japanese song covers.

---

#### Black Adam

<time id="black-adam">[2022-10-23 20:30] </time>

Enjoyed *Black Adam*, despite the poor critic reviews. The plot isn't anything spectacular, but it's a fun romp and good for comic fans.

Was very happy to be correct that [the actress playing Adrianna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Shahi) was Shaw from [Person of Interest](/tags/personofinterest/)! She should have gotten higher billing. Brosnan gave a great performance as Fate. The VFX guys really loved Cyclone. Atom Smasher probably my favorite of the JSA crew. The Rock maximizing the use of his one "smoldering" look. 

Viola Davis, Jennifer Holland, Djimon Hounsou, and [surprise mid-credits actor cameo] reprising roles were welcome surprises.

The only character I didn't actually like was Hawkman, mostly because (a) Hawkman is a terrible character; and (b) this version seemed even worse than usual (why is he rich?), and for some reason they chose him to be head of the JSA!

Overall IDK about changing the hierarchy of power or whatever, but I think a pretty decent step forward for the DCEU.

#### Catch Me If You Can

<time id="catch-me">[2022-10-26 13:29] </time>

Watched *Catch Me If You Can* last night. Actually over two nights. Been meaning to see this for a while, it looked neat. 

Frank Abagnale's capers are largely entertaining, though the narration does feel heavily exaggerated in favor of the protagonist (and reading through [Abagnale's wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Abagnale) suggests so as well). DiCaprio and Hanks give great performances here and I really enjoyed how they spoke every Christmas became friends by the end.

#### See How They Run (2022)

<time id="letterboxd-review-329402655">[2022-12-28 07:26] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/8/6/5/1/0/686510-see-how-they-run-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6f39272362" /></p> <p>An ok whodunnit with 1.5 likeable leads, though trying to compare itself to Agathe Christie is a bad idea as the mystery here is nowhere near as clever. This is the first time I've seen Saoirse Ronan in anything.</p>

---

#### The Gentlemen (2019)

<time id="letterboxd-review-330319397">[2022-12-29 22:28] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/2/2/8/9/452289-the-gentlemen-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=fe10998b1d" /></p> <p>Maybe a little bit self-indulgent but I really enjoyed this one. A lot of the dialogue and banter was great and I like how the plot wrapped around itself. Hugh Grant here is the least Hugh Grant-like I've ever seen him.</p>

### TV

#### Only Murders in the Building

<time id="23af5dc063224b0fbafec7f8097adddb">[2022-01-07 20:38] </time>

I binged the first season of this last week because I saw a good review of it. It's a comedy, but not a laugh-out-loud funny one, more wit than laugh track, though Steve Martin does put in some physical comedy at some point. <!--sep-->It was ok, reasonably clever, but also a bit predictable. True crime fans might enjoy it more. Not sure if I'd watch the next season.

---

#### Arcane: League of Legends

<time id="7716cd7e971f869c82795cb6fcbc54e5">[2022-01-11 23:18] </time>

Finally watched this despite not knowing anything about League of Legends, mostly because everyone kept raving about how great it was. First off, the animation and aesthetic are fantastic and top-notch.
<!--sep-->
Story is ok, a typical tragic class conflict where there are few real heroes. Music is great; I like the opening song by Imagine Dragons. Will probably watch the next season.

#### Doctor Who 2022 Specials

<time id="doctor-who-2022">[2022-10-29 14:21] </time>

Caught up with Jodie's last 3 Doctor Who specials this week, since the internet already spoiled me about the thing at the end. Spoilers will be unmarked.

*Eve of the Daleks* I should have enjoyed because I like time loops, but the execution here was a bit weird. They said in one of the earlier loops that they needed to save the guy because he was about to be killed and his death would be "locked in" for the next loop, which implies that they start each later loop with the "one-minute" state from the previous loops, but then later loops still have them starting out in the same place (Doctor near the Tardis, etc). I know this is all timey-wimey BS, but they should at least try to be consistent! Other than that, I have no real gripes about the episode, although it feels like it could have just been a regular season episode and not a special.

*Legend of the Sea Devils* was ok but kinda meh/unremarkable. Hooray for historical Asian representation I guess? Kind of rare in this series. Also could have been just a regular season episode.

*The Power of the Doctor* feels like a special, with all the appearances from previous Doctors and companions and multiple plot threads and disasters needing to be resolved simultaneously. Still a bit annoyed with the writing here as so much is handwaved and not explained at all. How did the master get the Daleks and the Cybermen to cooperate? Why did the shadow planet need to be in 1916, other than a need for Ra-ra-rasputin dance scene? Dan suddenly dropping out also didn't feel like it was handled very well. A lot of the set pieces were nice (especially the space train), but felt a bit like compensating for weak plotting with spectacle. Kinda typical of the Chibnail era actually.

Looking forward to what madness Russel T. Davies and Disney+ bring us for the next series!
