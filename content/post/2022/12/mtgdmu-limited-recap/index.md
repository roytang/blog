Notes:

- I was a bit busy during that time, so I didn't get to play and draft as much DMU as I'd like
- That being said I think I did relative well; the overall winrate is above average for me.
- Green was my best and favorite color by a mile; I really loved playing domain decks and delving into splashes and five-color whenever I can.
- This is the first one of these recaps where I've included Alchemy drafts, though the sample size isn't great.
