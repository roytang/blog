Monday weeknotes again, very late this time because I was away most of Sunday and Monday. Was honestly tempted to just push it to tomorrow but hey, we gotta have *some* discipline.

### A Quote

> "We say *in the grand scheme of *things* as if there were one. We say *that's not how the world works* as if the world works."

### The World

- UK: [Liz Truss has resigned after 44 days in office](https://nypost.com/2022/10/20/liz-truss-resigns-as-british-prime-minister/), setting a record for shortest ever term as UK PM. [Rishi Sunak is taking over](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/24/uk/profile-rishi-sunak-uk-politics-intl-gbr/index.html). 
- PH: In a bit of *schadenfreude*, one of my chat groups was discussing how politics in more advanced nations can be just as bad as ours, where Marcos appointed [a former police chief as Health undersecretary](https://mb.com.ph/2022/10/23/ex-pnp-chief-cascolan-appointed-as-new-doh-undersecretary/) (a department which doesn't even have a cabinet secretary yet!) and the alleged middleman in the assassination of a government critic [has died in prison](https://mb.com.ph/2022/10/20/middleman-in-percy-lapid-killingdies-in-national-bilibid-prison-doj/), a bit of a suspicious plot twist.
- Entertainment: [Disney+ is *finally* coming to the PH next month](https://twitter.com/dumidyeypee/status/1582918007612837888)! Not yet sure I'd get it though, seems less solid if I don't have kids.

### My Week

- My week was mixed. On the one hand, last week's bad news about a friend became even worse, and the worst-case scenario is now likely. On the other hand, I did spend the weekend [relaxing and celebrating an occasion with family](/2022/10/seda/), so that's nice.

- Managed to catch up with [Inktober 2022](/tags/inktober2022) late last week, then promptly fell behind again since my weekend was busy.

- Gamedev: [Results for Ludum Dare 51 came in](/2022/10/ludum-dare-51-pizza/#1583849707457351680)!

- **Gaming**: 
    - Just the normal grinding in [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame) and [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena), not even doing particularly well. Might try to draft and stream sometime soon.
    - Still trying to power through **SMT5** and **Paradise Killer**.
    - Had a good week in **Street Fighter V** and [managed to rank up](/2022/12/street-fighter-v/#1582700303526531073q)! One rank to go!

- Trivia team attended [another in-person quiz night last Thursday](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-stage) and it went reasonably well.

- Media Diet: Watched [Bullet Train (2022)](/notes/2022/10/bullet-train/) last Saturday, and snuck in a cinema viewing of [Black Adam (2022)](/notes/2022/10/black-adam/) during Sunday's staycation. Finished reading [Shadows of Self](/2022/10/shadows-of-self/) as well!

### Some Links of Interest

- [The Proprietary Syndication Formats - Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net/2022/10/17/the-proprietary-syndication-formats/): 

- [First Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania trailer is out!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlNFpri-Y40)

Not a lot today, as I have fallen behind in my link processing backlog. To help alleviate this backlog, I have decided to add [a page listing a bunch of unprocessed links](/page/links/unprocessed/).

Visit the [Links page](/links/) for more links of interest.

### This coming week:

- It's the last week of October! Time flies, etc. Next weekend is a long weekend hereabouts.
- Apparently Jodie Whitaker's Doctor Who regenerated over the weekend and the internet immediately spoiled a surprise for me. Time to catch up! Actually, there's a bunch of shows I really should just watch already.
- In MTG land, Brothers War preview season should officially kick off this week!
- Later this week, we should find out whether Elon Musk really will buy Twitter!
