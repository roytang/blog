Apparently these weeknotes just happen on Mondays now.

### The World

I don't have a lot to say about the world this week; a lot of it feels like more of the same. Escalation in Ukraine. China being China. Covid just keeps trucking along. Famous people saying stupid things. Etc etc.

### My Week

- [Life is short, random, unfair and dumb](/2022/10/1581299378299449344/). My week was going fine, but then Saturday evening I received bad news (about a friend) and since then the week has felt tinged with sadness. Still waiting on the eventual outcome, but at this point it is difficult to be optimistic.
  
- [Inktober 2022](/tags/inktober2022) catchup still in-progress. I thought I could catch up yesterday, but stuff happened and so no.

- I have been trying to cut down on snacking, for health reasons, and one thing I've found that surprisingly works is that in my daily journaling, I explicitly congratulate myself if I didn't snack on anything the previous day.

- With mastodon.technology shutting down, I went ahead and [migrated to new Mastodon account](https://roytang.net/2022/10/109151752766558627/): [@roytang@indieweb.social](https://indieweb.social/@roytang).

- **Gaming**: 
    - Just the normal grinding in [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame) and [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena), not even doing particularly well. I did manage [to stream some Alchemy: Dominaria United last Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBrcltg0qh8), though I didn't do particularly well. I was thinking of streaming some more of it this Thursday, but apparently it rotates out later today and I have neither the time nor resources to draft it today, so :shrug:
    - Still playing **SMT5** and **Paradise Killer**. I wish I had time to just power through these. Paradise Killer in particular is a bit challenging because I still have no idea how to solve this mystery!
    - Still trying to rank up in **Street Fighter V**, but I've cut down on the number of matches I play per day, as they take some time. Besides, forcing myself to play too much when I'm on tilt is bad for the run. Last week's record was a decent 20-16 overall (half my losses were on the first day!) and I think I ended up close to my all-time high LP.

### Media Diet

Watched and reviewed some [comic books](/2022/10/incredible-hulk-new-mutants/) and [some Marvel TV/movies](/2022/10/watching-lately-marvel/) this past week!

### Some Links of Interest

Spent some time this week going through my reader backlog and my backlog of saved links to harvest some links to share:

- [None of Your Business · Matthias Ott – User Experience Designer](https://matthiasott.com/notes/none-of-your-business): 
    > So, if you did your best when you created a piece of work, but your perfectionism or fear of judgement or lack of confidence makes you not like it, ask yourself: who is this piece for and will it work? And then, allow it to exist, to grow, to evolve, to improve, to fade away, or to shine. But first, make it work.

- [Pluralistic: 15 Oct 2022 How lawyers became sadists – Pluralistic](https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/15/lex-sadist/): 
    > The greed-is-good ideology comes out of a school of right-wing economics whose central tenet is "incentives matter." Forget the high-minded rhetoric about public duty, empathy or morals – the only way to reliably motivate people is by paying them to act the way you want them to, and to take away their money when they stop.

- [Why Games Criticism Never Went Mainstream | by Clive Thompson | Oct, 2022 | Medium](https://clivethompson.medium.com/why-games-criticism-never-went-mainstream-d95ea346d423)

- [Improve the readability of the content on your website - Piccalilli](https://piccalil.li/tutorial/improve-the-readability-of-the-content-on-your-website/): I'll probably find this useful later

- [You Might Not Need JavaScript](http://youmightnotneedjs.com/): Note: site is apparently 6yo (https://twitter.com/Una/status/1580990491847708672) so some stuff might be out of date

- [Pluralistic: 11 Oct 2022 Trusting (machine learning) trust](https://pluralistic.net/2022/10/11/rene-descartes-was-a-drunken-fart/): Doctorow on trust, backdoors and machine learning

- [I wish my web server were in the corner of my room (Interconnected)](https://interconnected.org/home/2022/10/10/servers): 

- [LEGEND - A DRAGON BALL TALE (FULL FILM) - 2022 STUDIO STRAY DOG - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JKLM45aIik): I feel like I must've shared this before already. It's pretty good.

### This coming week:

- Ludum Dare 51 ratings come out at the end of the week! I remain cautiously optimistic
- We have a quiz night to attend again this coming week
- I think **Black Adam** is also out this week? We have a family mall excursion planned at some point during the weekend, so I might try to watch it then.
