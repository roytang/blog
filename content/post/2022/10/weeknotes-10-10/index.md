These weeknotes are coming in late because as I told some friends yesterday "my tummy is being a dummy" and I was too uncomfortable to get anything done.

### The World

- William Shatner [on his trip to space](https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/william-shatner-space-boldly-go-excerpt-1235395113/):

    > "It was among the strongest feelings of grief I have ever encountered. The contrast between the vicious coldness of space and the warm nurturing of Earth below filled me with overwhelming sadness. Every day, we are confronted with the knowledge of further destruction of Earth at our hands: the extinction of animal species, of flora and fauna . . . things that took five billion years to evolve, and suddenly we will never see them again because of the interference of mankind. It filled me with dread. My trip to space was supposed to be a celebration; instead, it felt like a funeral."

- [A Russian bridge to Crimea got exploded,](https://edition.cnn.com/2022/10/08/europe/crimea-bridge-explosion-intl-hnk/index.html) no one has claimed responsibility. [The Iran protests are gathering steam.](https://twitter.com/dpatrikarakos/status/1578916102633304064) [Elon Musk is pretending to want to buy Twitter again](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-10-07/matt-levine-s-money-stuff-elon-musk-has-three-weeks-to-change-his-mind), probably because he will likely lose in court. 

- **PH**: [Marcos Jr. signs the SIM card registration bill into law](https://twitter.com/carloshconde/status/1579316217810391041); I do not approve. Former Senator De Lima, imprisoned for 5 years on trumped-up drug charges by the Duterte admin, [survived a hostage-taking at Camp Crame after some other prisoners tried to stage a prison break](https://twitter.com/PhilippineStar/status/1579062287578849280). Conspiracy theories abound.

- [Mastodon.technology is shutting down!](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/) [Oh well.](/2022/10/109125868390603935/) I guess it's time to ~~make my own backend ActivityPub compatible~~ look for a new instance!

- In entertainment that interests me, some new trailers this week: [Super Mario Bros Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPpazvJrHm0), [Power of the Doctor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxaDzBPBuP8) (Oct 23), [Star Trek Picard season 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wo2V1cSVj-w) (Feb 16)


### My Week

- A new party member, *pamangkin* #7, joined the family this past week!
  
- On the blog: [The Ludum Dare 51 blog post](/2022/10/ludum-dare-51-pizza/). I reviewed and gave feedback on a bunch of submissions this week and have already hit the needed number of submissions, so now it's wait and see mode until the ratings period is over (in around 12 days). I got some good feedback this time, so I'm cautiously optimistic that we do well.

- I finally started the Inktober thing. Hoping to catch up maybe in a few days. I know the Inktober guy is a bit shady, but eh, too lazy to find a good alternative, and some people I know are doing this one too.

    {{< collections-embed sketchbook inktober2022_1_2_3_4 >}}

- **Gaming**: 
    - Just the normal grinding in [Eternal](/tags/EternalCardGame) and [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena), not even doing particularly well. Alchemy: Dominaria United dropped last week, so might try to draft and stream again either tomorrow or Thursday (why not both?)
    - Still playing **SMT5** and **Paradise Killer**. 
    - Still trying to rank up in **Street Fighter V**. Actually had a positive 29-24 record this past week, but even that was just enough to barely stay in Super Silver. Ranking up is hard =/

### Media Diet

It's actually been a bit sparse. I haven't watched any new movies in a month! Should correct that soon.
