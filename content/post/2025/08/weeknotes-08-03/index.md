It is August! Where did July go?

### My Week

- The usual end of month traditions: paying bills, reviewing expenses, etc etc. Boring adulting stuff.
- Niece #5 was born this past week! We didn't get the chance to visit them at the hospital; we are hoping to see them next weekend when we hopefully have our usual early August family get-together.
- Trivia team attended quiz nights on [Monday](/2025/07/aboutquiz-bts-stem/) and [Thursday](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-anniv9-vault)!
- Had the chance to wander around Greenhills a bit last Thursday. When I'm there I often spend the time looking at all the toy/collector/hobby shops in Shoppesville Plus. I am glad I never got too into toys/figurines as a hobby, as it's quite expensive, but they are nice to look at so browsing the shops every so often is fun. I am always tempted to buy Transformers though.
- On the blog: review of [Wind and Truth](/2025/08/wind-and-truth/) finally!
- Honestly not sure where most of the week went.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Not a lot of progress. I am almost done with the Fear Itself tie-ins! I think I can target a new [complete Marvel run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post before the end of August.
- Books: 
    - Finished: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth**!! Review linked above. I jumped from 57% to 100% in like half a week!
    - Now to find more books to read! I am only at 2 books this year so far!

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**
- Finished: **Rick and Morty S8** 
- Movies: This week I watched [Companion (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/companion-2025/) and [Aliens (1986)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/aliens/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Somehow I am almost through another season of Snap. Still need to grind out Conquest etc.
    - **Magic Arena**: New set *Edge of Eternities* came out this week; I have already done a couple of drafts and they were predictably terrible. I used up most of my currency for the *Final Fantasy* set, so I will be drafting a lot less for this new set. Also, I should write the set recap for the previous set.
- Other online games:
    - **Marvel Rivals**: Played a bit of this yesterday. Still not very good at it, but it's easy to get into.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Still slowly working on the backlog of single-player missions.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. Progress is still slow, I probably played less than 3 hours this past week.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 56,934 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). This is only slightly better than the previous week, but I'll take it. The weather was much more pleasant this past week after the 3 storms of the previous one; towards the end of the week we are back to heat levels I might describe as "stifling".

    >  If Big Tech is clinging to government contracts and quid pro quo perks, then we must be out of ideas. Every time the winds of fortune change, everyone points their boats in the same direction. In a healthy, living economy shouldn’t there be more than one lake to fish in? Instead of asking “What doesn’t exist and would be useful?” and investing in that, it’s about “How can I extract the most money from hot new tech?” Instead of “What’s quality?” and chasing that, it’s “How can we move fast and make breakable things?”

- [The renewable energy revolution is a feat of technology | Rebecca Solnit | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/ng-interactive/2025/jul/30/renewable-energy-revolution-technology)

    > An energy revolution is underway in this century, though it’s unfolded in ways slow enough and technical enough for most people not to notice (and I assume it’s nowhere near finished). It is astonishing – a powerful solution to the climate crisis and the depredations of the fossil fuel industry and for-profit utilities. Making it more visible would make more people more enthused about it as a solution, a promise, a possibility we can, should, must pursue swiftly and wholeheartedly.

    > I’m sure there are many reasons Mozilla chose to kill Pocket. But it’s hard not to see it as one of the last remnants of a different understanding of what the internet is primarily for. When I miss the internet of the 2010s, it’s not just because I miss an internet less magnetized by Trump, although I certainly do miss that. I miss the internet that wanted to be read, not scrolled, and created tools accordingly.

    Kind of preaching to the choir for me, but it's always good when people with bigger followings endorse RSS

    > Ask yourself: What’s true today, that was true for a software engineer in 1991? One simple answer is: Sharing and accessing information with a uniform resource identifier. That was true 30+ years ago, I would venture to bet it will be true in another 30 years — and more!

    > The source code of the very first web page — which was written for a line mode browser — still runs today on a touchscreen smartphone, which is not a device that Tim Berners-less could have anticipated.

    > The durability guarantees of the web are absolutely astounding if you take a moment to think about it.

### Looking Forward

- Some family birthdays next weekend, so we are probably doing a get together.
- Not much else is scheduled, though there's a bunch of errands I want to get done.
