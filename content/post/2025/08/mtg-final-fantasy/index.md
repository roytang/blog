*Edge of Eternities* is already out on Arena, so here's my recap for the previous set **Final Fantasy**. This is the first big draftable *Universes Beyond* crossover set available on Arena, and I'm a big fan of [the source material](/blog/tags/final-fantasy/), so was looking forward to it and was hoping to play as many drafts as I can!

### Limited Summary / Notes

- During [the last set](/2025/06/mtg-dragonstorm/) I broke my record of most drafts played for a set on Arena with 35 drafts. This time around I broke it *again* and by a mile. I did a total of 59 drafts for Final Fantasy. FIFTY-NINE!! This number seems insane. Back when I was primarily playing on paper I would be lucky to get maybe 5 drafts in a season, and even on MTGO if I managed like 10-15 drafts for a set that would already be a lot. Again, fifty-nine feels insane! Especially considering sets these days only last for a couple of months, and quick draft periods have been shrunk down to 2 shifts of 10 days each!
- Despite the insane number of drafts I played, my win rate was quite bad. It took me a while to really "get" the format so my initial attempts were very bad, and then it got a bit better, but towards the end after I managed to hit Diamond rank my win rate started to tank again as I fought much higher-ranked players. I ended the season with a pitiful 51.43% win rate. TBH, I'm surprised I still had a positive win record at all, as I had so many days with successive bad drafts.
- I think I draft better than I pilot. A lot of times I put together what feels like a good draft deck, but I get losses due to misplays and such.
- Despite my not-so-great win rate, I really enjoyed the set. A good part of that was the flavor - I just love the games, though I'm not familiar with 100% of the source material (notably the MMOs FF11 and FF14 are my blind spots). But the limited environment was also very well designed, with some excellent mechanics and archetypes that had some great overlap and had a good variety of interesting decks to be built. It can be challenging to put a deck together (it always is); synergy felt extra important. But when the decks come alive with synergy and a good curve it feels great. There are still some ridiculous bombs (looking at you Ardyn!) but overall the format feels like it has a decent balance.
- I actually did surprisingly well with many of the draft archetypes. My favorite one has to be the "4-mana-spent-to-cast" blue-red archetype, something that on paper sounds like it would be too clunky to work well in limited, but somehow they managed to make it work. I would not have predicted that {{< card >}}Sahagin{{< /card >}} would be one of my favorite commons of the set! I never trophied with this color pair though.
- I also loved the black mages mechanic and the chocobos; I will miss those pingy little dudes and the growing birds! 
- I also found myself gravitating a lot to the UG "towns" ramp archetype, mainly because it faciliated easy 5c splashing, and if you read my Dragonstorm recap you know I always enjoy drafting 5c soup decks. Sadly it didn't work out too well here; a lot of my bad drafts were because I tried forcing too many colors and I think towns actually did worse the higher I got in the ranks.
- My worst archetype turns out to be WU artifacts, I just could not get that to work at all.
- During this season I managed to hit Diamond rank in limited for the first time! Simply playing a lot of games works after all. During the last few days of the season, I tried to play as many drafts as I could to see if I could maybe push that to mythic, but the competition was fierce. I ended up using up most of my currency and just doing poorly. As a consequence, I sadly won't be able to play a lot of *Edge of Eternities* drafts!
- This set is also the closest I've ever gotten to being playset-complete. I am currently rare complete and missing a mere 7 mythics.
- I started drafting this set before starting *Final Fantasy XVI*, and this spoiled a bit of the game's early story for me lol.
- Repeating that I loved the flavor: there were so many flavor wins in the card implementations. I'm actually a bit sad that I don't get to enjoy the commander cards for the set the same way.

### 7-x Draft Decks

- I typically only get around 2-3 trophies in a season, but this time I got 4. Which is understandable given the sheer number of drafts I played.
- That WG one below with Yuna and Garnet and Knights of the Round just felt so good to play!

### Magic Arena Stats

Received my stats email literally the day after this post was published:

{{< photos arenastats >}}

The most surprising part for me here is that my Boosters Opened and Games Played stats, while higher than they are for the average set, do not feel as outrageous as the sheer number of drafts I did.

### Streaming videos

- I managed to stream a good number of my early drafts. There is [a Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXiBh9YDLeL_0dzXRUq9tpWN) of the VODs.
- Before this set, my last streamed on Twitch was [in Oct 2024 with Duskmourn](/2024/11/duskmourn/#streaming-videos)!

### Next

The new set **Edge of Eternities** is already live and I've done a few drafts already. *Final Fantasy* used up most of my resources, so probably will not be drafting this new set as much!
