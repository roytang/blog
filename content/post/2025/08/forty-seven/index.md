When I sit down to write one of these, typically I will first trawl through some of [the past birthday posts](/blog/tags/birthday/) so that past me can inform what I write. This year I decided not to be too introspective (and also be a bit lazy) and instead rely on past me's wisdom. Here is a list of forty-seven nuggets of wisdom and advice I have posted or shared on social media over the years. (I last did something like this back in [year thirty-eight](/2016/08/thirty-eight/); I did not check to see if there were duplicates.)

1. If you don't know what you want, it's probably sleep.
2. It's never too late to be who you might have been.
3. "It's better to be safe than sorry" is such crap. You know what's better than being safe? Being AWESOME. *(Apparently I wrote this back when I was much more ambitious than I am now)*
4. Bad news: I have no idea what I'm doing. Good news: I don't think anybody else does really. We're all just stumbling along.
5. Time is our only real constraint.
6. If everything is urgent, nothing is urgent.
7. How to attract good luck: Treat other people well.
8. You gotta know when to step back and take a break.
9. Mondays are when you have to face all that stuff you didn't want to do last Friday.
10. We need to relax. Relaxing is cool.
11. Being willing to fight means being willing to live with the loss.
12. The only thing we should hate is hate itself.
13. We won't find happiness by dwelling on the past; leave your regrets behind and keep moving forward. *(I still dwell too much on the past, probably)*
14. Every so often, try to view the world upside down.
15. We should stop worrying about things we can't change or influence.
16. Stop responding to work emails after clocking out.
17. Unfortunately, life doesn't come with a manual. We humans have to figure things out as we go along.
18. Christmas/holidays tip: Buy a small gift for yourself, wrap and hide it. During the next year when you're feeling down, open it up and remember joy.
19. There's no need to always be in a hurry. Take a walk and wander around for a while.
20. You're never too old to headbang your worries away.
21. Need to learn to appreciate the small victories.
22. Hope for the best, but be ready for the worst.
23. Learn to recognize when you're being irrational; adjust your decisions accordingly.
24. Don't mistake excitement for happiness.
25. Just because something is cheap doesn't make it worth buying.
26. Sometimes you just need to stop, take a breath, and say "Now what?"
27. Everything is gonna be alright.
28. Just because you did things right doesn't mean you're going to get what you expect.
29. Through some combination of effort, blind luck and circumstance, here we are.
30. Just enjoy life, you'll never get out of it alive anyway.
31. Start the new year right. Be late for work. *(I guess it also works if it's 'start the day right')*
32. Life gets easier to digest the moment you accept that it doesn't always make sense.
33. Truth yearns to be known.
34. Sometimes the best advice comes from the unlikeliest source.
35. When you are winning, advance cautiously and solidify your position. When you are losing, take risks aggressively to recover lost ground.
36. Go to sleep. Tomorrow will be better.
37. Have the courage to be silly every so often (at least).
38. When you feel weak or tempted, say to yourself out loud "I am better than this".
39. Every once in a while, consider the possibility that you might be completely wrong.
40. The world that is harsh and cruel should not rob us of idealism; the greater the darkness, the more we should strive towards the light.
41. There's never enough time.
42. The new day can't begin unless you let the old one end.
43. Maybe life is what happens when we aren't paying attention.
44. Someday we're going to run out of tomorrows.
45. There's no shame in giving up for the day and trying again tomorrow. *(It's a bit ironic what this comes right after!)*
46. If someone is rude to you, don't get mad. Just imagine that he really needs to poop.
47. Decision making tip: always add an option to “be paralyzed by indecision”. Example: go out for a walk, stay home and get some more work done, or be paralyzed by indecision?

I was worried that I wouldn't have enough to fill this list, but turns out things I posted from 2010-2017 were enough, so there are a few leftover. Maybe I will get to do another one of these when I'm like 60. And maybe the world will be better then. One can always hope.
