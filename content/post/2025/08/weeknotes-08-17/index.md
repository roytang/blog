### The World

Trump and Putin met up in Alaska this weekend to try to resolve the Ukraine war. Predictably, nothing of significance happened except we got to witness the supposed leader of the free world fawning over a Russian autocrat.

### My Week

- Not sure where most of the week went. 
- Had a family get-together at home last Sunday to celebrate some birthdays. Always fun to have all the kids at the house because it's super chaotic!
- I did manage to get a good amount of work done on the planned site changes; hopefully I can deploy them soon. (This mostly only affects me lol.)
- Went out a couple of times during the week; once to meetup with an old friend for their birthday and another time to meetup with an old friend at the mall to watch a movie.
- On the blog: The long delayed [MTG set recap for the Final Fantasy set](/2025/08/mtg-final-fantasy/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Same same. Not much progress.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**, **Superman The Animated Series**
- Rewatching: *Brooklyn Nine-Nine*. Still a fun show and nice to just leave running on the second screen.
- Movies: Went to the cinema and watched [The Naked Gun (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-naked-gun/)!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Bleah.
    - **Magic Arena**: Still playing *Edge of Eternities* whenever I can, made difficult by low resources.
- Other online games:
    - **Marvel Rivals**: Only played a little bit of this; haven't really played a lot since Blade dropped.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam is still chugging along slowly.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 51,814 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). A bit of a drop over the previous week, due to a smattering of afternoon/late night rains. Nothing too intense, but enough to dissuade me from going out.

### Links to Share

- [A Secret Web](https://blog.clew.se/posts/secret-web/)

    > The big difference between the secret web and the large, messy corporate web is that people on it frequently link and reply to each other’s websites and blog posts, creating a compact network of people with related ideas and interests, while on the corporate web companies profit from keeping you on their site and link outwards begrudgingly.

    > Democracy isn’t perfect. It’s slow, it’s messy, it’s often staffed by people who don’t understand technology. But it’s also the only system that has consistently created the conditions for innovation to flourish: open competition, institutional independence, predictable rules, and the freedom to build something without worrying about political retaliation.
