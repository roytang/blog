title: 'Book Review: Wind and Truth by Sanderson, Brandon (Stormlight Archive book 5)'
---

Rhythm of War is book four in Sanderson's epic fantasy Stormlight Archive series. Goodreads tells me I read the prior book Oathbringer back in Nov 2017, but didn't bother writing a review, so I had to make sure I'd write one now.

*Wind and Truth* is book five in Sanderson's epic fantasy [Stormlight Archive](/blog/tags/stormlight-archive) series. I read the prior book [Rhythm of War](/2020/12/rhythm-of-war/) back in 2020!

I wrote in the previous book's review:

> The book's launch day kind of caught me a bit unexpectedly so I didn't bother doing a re-read of the previous three books. Which given an epic fantasy series of this scope might have been a mistake, but watch me do it again for book five. No review meant while reading every so often I'd stop and be like "Who is this character again, and why is she here?" 

And this was mostly true for this book as well, though I did at least [watch a recap of the previous book this time](/2024/12/weeknotes-12-15/#media-diet).

I read [the second book Words of Radiance](/2016/01/words-of-radiance/) in around 3 weeks; I read *Rhythm of War* in around EIGHT DAYS! For this book, I got it when it came out in the first week of December, and for whatever reason, it took me EIGHT WHOLE MONTHS to get through it; I finished reading on Jul 31st. 

I don't know why I had so much trouble with the start of the book. Part of it was because I had a busy (and shitty) end of 2024 and start of 2025, but admittedly, the book's pacing was also kinda slow at the start. The book is divided into 10 "days" that lead up to the contest of champions set up at the end of the previous book, and the first couple of days was a lot of theorycrafting on the part of our protagonists and setting them for where they would be for most of the rest of the book. I think it really only picks up around day 4 or so; I got there around a month ago and as is typical my reading started to speed up.

Another part of it might be that there are so many POVs here and we are constantly shifting focus. This book was supposedly going to be focused on Szeth, but given that this book needed to close the first "arc" of the planned 10-book series, there was a lot of other stuff to do. On top of Dalinar needing o figure out how to win the contest, there were dangling plotlines and character arcs of the other protagonists that still had to be resolved, the true history of Roshar and Odium and Honor to be discovered, and so on and so forth.

Our protags have a lot to do, and they split up to each do their own tasks. My favorite parts are the absolutely brutal siege defense parts: the battles to defend Azimir and the Shattered Plains. I love this kind of large scale combats with long odds (see: The Battle of Helm's Deep) and these parts are absolutely brutal; characters die and get maimed and make desperate gambits to try to turn things around.

Maybe spoilers about how the book ends:

I was kind of hoping for a "good" ending for our protags given the end of the arc, but the ending we got was closer to a stalemate and by Dalinar's own admission, just "kicks the can down the road", so to speak.

That being said, I was satisfied with how our protags' character arcs worked out; each one got their own moments to shine and many of them even got through unscathed, though probably not where they want to be.

I am a bit of two minds about how there are so many tie-ins now to the greater cosmere, especially since I'm not shying away from looking things up. It means I have so many other things to read!

It's kind of amazing how far the franchise and the universe have come. The first book was a fairly straightforward story about Kaladin breaking free of his chains and now here we are with a bunch of new protags all working together to try to stop a literal god from escaping his prison and wreaking havok across all the worlds. 

I am looking forward to the second arc, though it might be a long time before we get that. (I suppose that gives me time to try to read his other books too?)
