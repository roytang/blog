### My Week

- It's a long weekend for us over here, more or less, with the usual smattering of August holidays. Tuesday was Quezon City day, Thursday was Ninoy Aquino day, while this coming Monday is National Heroes Day. Though holidays don't really afffect the household much.
- My week was fairly tame. I was stuck on home watch duty for a couple of days while the folks went out on an excursion. I ordered pizza for myself.
- Finally deployed new site changes last Thursday! [Wrote a blog post about it of course](/2025/08/aug2025-site-updates/). Am generally happy with the changes so far; I have not received a single resource usage alert on the server since the deployment!
- Nothing too interesting for me at Gamescom. Well, Silksong finally got a release date (Sep04), but it's not like I plan to get that on release anyway.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Same same. Not much progress.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**, **Superman The Animated Series**
- Finished: *Brooklyn Nine-Nine* rewatch. I don't think I ever wrote a proper review/send-off for the show, so I think I'll include it in the next reviews post.
- Started watching:
    - **Peacemaker S2**: Retcons and full frontal nudity and John Cena being sad!
    - **Poker Face**: I've been meaning to watch this for a while.
    - **Young Sheldon**: Was looking for a longish series to replace the B99 binge rewatch and settled on this one since I've never seen it. The tone is much more drama than TBBT so far; reminds me a bit of The Wonder Years
- Movies: Nothing this week!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: WTH, there's High Voltage again?!?
    - **Magic Arena**: I am surprisingly doing much better with *Edge of Eternities* limited than I was with [Final Fantasy](/2025/08/mtg-final-fantasy/), though I am playing probably a third as many drafts.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Still sneak through a bit of this every so often, mostly to try to catch up to the single-player content that's still churning out regularly.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam is still chugging along slowly. I think I am getting close to the end, I have maxed out some of the upgrades already.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 53,081 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), only a small bump from last week. The weather was a bit rainier too. During the second half of the week I was under the weather, coming down with coughs and colds. I have already taken a few days' worth of Neozep Forte.

    > "If there is so much knowledge out there on how to make super fast websites, why aren’t many websites super fast? I think the answer is that slowness sneaks into websites, because of decisions made by designers, developers or the business. Despite best intentions, things that look like great ideas in the meeting room, can end up making the website ‘obese’ and therefore slow to end users"

Hm, nothing queued up for the week, might be mostly free. Some family stuff next weekend though.
