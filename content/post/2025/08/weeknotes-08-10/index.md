### My Week

- Kind of a chill week. 
- I did get some work done on some website backend stuff and hopefully I can transition the whole thing to the new system soon, which would hopefully make it easier to deal with the occasional bad AI crawlers.
- My mom's phone(s) (she had a second older phone as backup because the main one was dying already) needed replacing. I ended up buying her one from Lazada. I've always avoided ordering anything with a nontrivial price (say, more than P1000) on Lazada, because it feels like there's so many things that could go wrong when you pay the delivery guy without opening the parcel versus just going to the store and seeing the merchandise in your hand and trying it out before doing any payment. Even if you say you can just get a refund if things go wrong that's still a risk and a big hassle if things go wrong. Some friends reassured me that ordering from the official Samsung store on Lazada (I refuse to pay for Chinese phones) should be relatively safe, but that I should video the unboxing anyway so that I have a record in case of problems. The package arrived quickly (the next day), and thankfully, the box was not full of rocks. I am still annoyed that new phones these days not only do NOT come with a charging brick, the cable they provide is USBC to USBC, which I can't really use since I don't have any USBC charging bricks!
- I was originally hoping to get my mom a new phone when my contract renewal is up this August, but after checking Globe's phone plans, they are terrible and the phones still cost a lot, so I opted to downgrade my plan instead to a slightly cheaper one and just get a phone off Lazada instead. Then I checked my bill today and found out I re-upped my contract a few days too early and got charged an early termination fee. Oops. 
- I also bought an external DVD-RW drive. I think I've not had one for almost 10 years now! I needed one because my dad found some old discs he wanted to get the contents off of, and in the process of going through those old discs, I also found some very old data (circa 2001) that I thought I'd previously lost! Finding old files makes me unreasonably happy.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still some Fear Itself tie-ins to cover. Am also catching up a bit with new comics.
- Books: Haven't started anything new yet, though I've added a couple of options to ye older Kindle App.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**
- Started: **Superman The Animated Series** on HBO Max. I've never watched this series before despite enjoying the same-universe *Batman TAS* and *Justice League/Unlimited* series.
- Movies: None this week!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: New season etc.
    - **Magic Arena**: *Edge of Eternities* limited seems fun; it's too bad I can't play too much due to using up most of my resources on the previous set. I am still due to write the previous set's recap!
- Other online games:
    - **Marvel Rivals**: Played a bit too much of this during the week, mostly because there was a limited-time event I wanted to complete, but also for achievement hunting.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 60,469 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). This is again a slight bump over the previous week. It was still quite hot early in the week, but we started getting rains again the past few days. I think I heard someone say there might a typhoon or two brewing nearby.

- [27 Notes On Growing Old(er) - by Ian Leslie - The Ruffian](https://www.ian-leslie.com/p/27-notes-on-growing-older)

    Kind of an appropriate read for me this week.

    > "We’re cheating entropy from the moment we’re born. Every organism, including the one which is you, is a revolt - an organised rebellion - against the universe’s fundamental drive towards disorder. When you’re up against an enemy this implacable, I say it’s OK to cheat. In fact it’s heroic. The universe wants us to be dust and will eventually get the job done. Staying vital for as long as we can is a magnificently perverse act of resistance."

### Looking Forward

We *might* attend a quiz night this coming week.

The coming week doesn't seem too busy; I might be able to get some stuff done!

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:
