Another month is nearing its end!

### The World

Apparently rumors were spreading on Tiktok that the Rapture was happening last week. I guess they were all disappointed.

The US' advance to authoritarianism hit a free speech setback this week after ABC restored Jimmy Kimmel's show and even the affiliates that were initially pre-empting the show caved and ended their boycott. Trump was bigly mad.

Meanwhile, war continues to rage.

Locally, we were hit with a supertyphoon early in the week, one of the strongest for the year, followed by a slightly weaker typhoon in the second half of the week that was more wind than rain. The local corruption investigations continue apace. 

### My Week

- It was a very rainy week; we spent most of it indoors and at home.
- Thursday: Medical errands for patient #1; just the regular monitoring labs, although there were some findings that might be problematic, but her doctor doesn't seem to be finding it too urgent.
- Trivia team was originally planning to attend a quiz night, but two members were sick and I was once again suffering from coughs and colds, so we decided to just cancel.
- On the blog: My [set recap for the last MTG set Edge of Eternities](/2025/09/mtg-edge/) and finally [a review for Final Fantasy 16](/2025/09/final-fantasy-xvi/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still pending a new [Complete Marvel Run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post before I decide what to read next on that end. Also still trying to keep up with newer releases!

#### Watching

- Finished: **Young Sheldon**. The show has been a convenient background watch while playing Silksong, to the detriment of all the other shows below.
- Ongoing: **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Superman The Animated Series**, **Peacemaker S2**, **Only Murders In The Building S5**, **High Potential S2**.
- Movies: No new movies this week still.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Chugging along. Last week's Deadpool Diner limited-time event was pretty generous; got a bunch of cosmetics that I will never use.
    - **Magic Arena**: Started drafting the new Omenpaths set, to mixed results. Earlier today I also managed to already hit mythic in constructed for the month, so that's nice.
- Single-player games: 
    - Finished: **Final Fantasy XVI**. Review linked above.
    - Ongoing: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**. Been playing this way too much; I am pretty sure it has invaded my dreams. Very challenging/frustrating though.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

My coughs and colds have recurred early in the week, coinciding with the supertyphoon. Combined with the rainy weather, that made it difficult to hit my step targets especially Monday and Tuesday. Thankfully, I managed to catch up later in the week and Google Fit tells me I walked 53,611 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I am happy to have even hit 50k steps, but that means beating last year's total step count is moving further out of reach.

### Links to Share

Nothing to share in this space today unfortunately. I have been negligent in going through my feed reader, and the unread count has gotten unwieldy... might need to do declare bankruptcy at some point and just mark everything as read, though that pains me.

Check the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Looking Forward

It's going to be October! We have some family get-togethers planned.

I think new Ranma 1/2 season is dropping next weekend?
