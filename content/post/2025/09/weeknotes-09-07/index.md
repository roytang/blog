These weeknotes are once again coming in a day late because I was busy yesterday.

### My Week

- Last Sunday (the 31st) was the baptism of niece #5. Barring any unforeseen surprises, she is likely the last *pamangkin* and thus the last time we are attending a baptism in this manner.
- This past Saturday (the 6th) was our high school homecoming - it's been 30 years for our batch, so there was a big push for people to attend and multiple people were enticing me to go. Of course I did not lol.
- Trivia team [won a quiz night last Thursday](/collections/quiznights/aq-quiz-upon-star/)!
- Some blog posts this week: [movie/TV reviews](/2025/09/movies-tv-jul-aug-2025/) and [a book review](/2025/09/all-systems-red/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Finished reading: **All Systems Red** by Martha Wells. Review linked above!
- Comics reading: Trudging along slowly. I am hoping to write a new [Marvel run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post by end of month, or maybe early October.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**, **Superman The Animated Series**, **Peacemaker S2**, **Poker Face**, **Young Sheldon**. Lol I am watching a lot, it's a bit hard to keep up. And *High Potential S2* releases soon!
- Movies: No new movies this week.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Chugging along.
    - **Magic Arena**: I am doing sooo much better at EOE limited than I did with FIN, despite the limited resources. The current quick draft season is a bit short though. Once it's done, I'll probably stop so I can save up for the next set.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam is close to the end. Looks like I am at the "point of no return" before the final dungeon, as a ton of side quests became available, so I will probably spend the week burning through those first, then hopefully be able to finish the game the week after.
    - Started: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**. This game absolutely devastated the servers for Steam and other providers at launch! I wasn't initially planning to play this immediately, but turns out it was on PC Game Pass, so we are metroidvania-ing again apparently. It is very hard.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 59,157 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), a nontrivial jump from last week. Maybe should have pushed for 60k? 

The weather was a bit nicer this week, a bit less rains. Thankfully, my coughs and colds have receded, after a mere 43 doses of Neozep Forte.

### Looking Forward

- We might be attending another quiz night this coming week.
