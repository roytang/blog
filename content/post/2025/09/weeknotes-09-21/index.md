### The World

The US continued their gradual (?) descent into fascism this week when the FCC threatened Jimmy Kimmel over some mostly mundane Charlie Kirk comments and ABC was later forced to suspend him indefinitely after some big affiliates complained. AFAIK this isn't the first time the Trump admin attacked freedom of speech, but I think previously it was mostly through lawsuits and the judicial system? This was just the executive branch bullying someone because they were critical of the president and [Trump himself later said critical coverage of him is illegal](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/19/trump-no-longer-free-speech-00574219). Disney owns ABC, and they found themselves at the end of consumer outrage and reportedly the Disney+ cancellation page couldn't handle the load as lots of people were cancelling their subs in protest.

Here on our side, the big news the past couple of weeks has been the DPWH corruption hearings in the legislature which caused leadership changes in both houses. Today people are set to rally nationwide in protest against corruption (and I think the Duterte faction is trying to leverage this into a pro-Duterte thing?) I'm not participating, as I feel largely disconnected to the general local zeitgiest these days. It's partially disillusionment as I've seen all this before back in the day and I feel a bit cynical that any real change will really come out of it, but who knows? I am glad there are many people willing to rise up against this sort of thing, but I personally don't have the energy for it anymore. Maybe someday again...

The main reason I like to include a "The World" section in these weeknotes is so that future me can be reminded of what has been happening in the world during these weeks, but it's a bit depressing how it's often only bad news. Maybe someday I'll be writing things like "War in Ukraine is over!" or something.

### My Week

- I think my week was mostly uneventful. Managed to spend some time going through old files to process them.
- Thursday: Trivia team [attended a quiz night](/collections/quiznights/pq-eastwood-showrunners/) at Eastwood and surprisingly won!
- No extra blog posts this past week!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Books: Not a lot this week.
- Comics: Finished my Thor runs, so I just need to write the next [Complete Marvel Run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post! Also still trying to keep up with newer releases!

#### Watching

- Ongoing: , **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Superman The Animated Series**, **Peacemaker S2**, **Young Sheldon**, **Only Murders In The Building S5**.
- Finished: **Dandadan S2**.
- Started: **High Potential S2** via Disney+.
- Movies: No new movies this week still.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Chugging along. [Got to infinite this season](https://indieweb.social/@roytang/115222174502202279) after a long while!
    - **Magic Arena**: Waiting for the new set to release this coming week. That means I am also overdue for writing a set recap for *Edge of Eternity*.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI**. All hunts and sidequests are done I think! All that's left is to wrap up the main story. It's unlikely I go for completion on this one.
    - Ongoing: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**. Honestly been playing this a lot more than FF16. It's exhausting on the hands but at least it loads quickly.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 60,433 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Haven't hit 60k for like a month and a half now, so that's nice. Looking at my running total for the year, looks like I can still beat last year's total if I average around 67k steps a week for the remaining 16 weeks, a bit challenging!

### Site Updates

Backfilled some missing items from 2017-2019 to [the Quiz Nights collection](/collections/quiznights/).

    > this means treating your "to read" pile like a river (a stream that flows past you, and from which you pluck a few choice items, here and there) instead of a bucket (which demands that you empty it). After all, you presumably don't feel overwhelmed by all the unread books in the British Library – and not because there aren't an overwhelming number of them, but because it never occurred to you that it might be your job to get through them all.

Project plans, to-do lists, bucket lists and suchlike can all end up serving a similar function. They become places to collect things you want to do later, but the collecting stands in for the doing.

### Looking Forward

- New set drops on Arena this week!
- I think *Marvel Zombies* also drops on Disney+ this coming week, but I haven't even watched the previous animated thing *Eyes of Wakanda*.
- We are probably attending yet another quiz night.
