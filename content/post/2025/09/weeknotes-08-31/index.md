Unfortunately, it is September. That means the start of Christmas season over here. Jose Mari Chan is once again on the prowl. These weeknotes coming in a day late because I was busy yesterday.

### The World

Very rainy afternoon in QC last Saturday. Supposedly 5 days worth of rain fell in like 2-3 hours. Lots of places were flooded. I think I mostly slept through it.

Rumors spread of Trump's demise. That turned out to be wishful thinking, unfortunately. His 50% tariffs on India seem to have pushed Modi closer to China as Xi welcomes Modi and Putin to a summit. I commented to some friends that it was unfortunate that China was bullying us with a territorial dispute, as it seems likely they will emerge dominant in the new world order to come, with the US punting any advantage it had.

### My Week

- My week was kind of boring and uneventful, and I spent most of it at home. I did get to focus on some backlogged tasks I've had for a while and made some real progress! These are things that only matter to me.
- No other blog posts this past week.
- My trivia bot has been dead for a while, so I let the domain (triviastorm.net) expire yesterday. The website content has been migrated to https://trivia.roytang.net

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Started reading: **All Systems Red** by Martha Wells. This is the firstbook of *The Murderbot Diaries*, which I've heard many good things about the Apple TV adaptation. The book is very short, turns out it is a novella. If I had a better attention span, I could have finished it in one sitting.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**, **Superman The Animated Series**, **Peacemaker S2**. **Poker Face** kind of stalled, but I hope to resume soon. IDK if I want to keep watching **Young Sheldon**.
- Movies: Watched a few this week: [Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/popstar-never-stop-never-stopping/), [Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/sonic-the-hedgehog-3/), and [The Thursday Murder Club (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-thursday-murder-club/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Now just trying to finish my end of season grinds.
    - **Magic Arena**: Managed to finish the month in mythic constructed! Waiting for EOE quick drafts to come back later this week to continue limited. I can probably afford to play a few quick drafts before stopping to save currency for the next set.
        - Previews for the upcoming **Spider-Man** set kicked off this week. The previews were okay, but since that set is *not* coming to Arena, I'm a bit more interested to see what the Omenpaths treatment will be like, which should be discussed this week.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Playing this a bit more lately.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam is still chugging along slowly. 

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 50,356 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), only a small bump from last week. Unfortunately, 50k for a week seems like my new baseline anyway. It was quite rainy this past week too, especially in the afternoons and evenings, so I should be glad I even managed that much.

    > "But I am a hater, and I will not be polite. The machine is disgusting and we should break it. The people who build it are vapid shit-eating cannibals glorifying ignorance. I strongly feel that this is an insult to life itself."

    >

    > "I became a hater by doing precisely those things AI cannot do: reading and understanding human language; thinking and reasoning about ideas; considering the meaning of my words and their context; loving people, making art, living in my body with its flaws and feelings and life. AI cannot be a hater, because AI does not feel, or know, or care. Only humans can be haters. I celebrate my humanity."

To beat that, you need to be continuously investing significant engineering effort into cutting-edge application work."
