### The World

Well, the world certainly had a week.

- Israel shot rockets into Qatar supposedly to target Hamas leaders
- Russia sent drones into Poland, causing them to invoke NATO Article 4
- A prominent and hateful conservative influencer was assassinated in the US, raising the temperature in an already divided nation.
- Here in the PH, the Duterte alliance in the Senate fell apart and a new Senate president was elected, all amidst the ongoing corruption investigations.
- Gen Z protesters in Nepal forced their leadership to resign and [a new interim prime minister was chosen over Discord](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/nepal-sushila-karki-prime-minister-discord-protests-b2825843.html) of all things!

I was talking to the quiz night host last Wednesday and they said they were preparing a category about "events that happened this week", and we were both like "so many things have already happened!" and I quipped that there was still time for world war 3 to break out. Thankfully that was not prophetic. Not yet anyway.

### My Week

- Last Sunday (the 7th) we had the family over with all the *pamangkins* and everything, always a lot of fun.
- Tuesday: I had to go to the hospital for a few medical / bureaucratic errands. The one that took the longest time ended up for naught because apparently we had been given the wrong info by the refering agency, oops. At least I got there early and it took a bit less time than the last time I tried it.
- Wednesday: Trivia team [attended a quiz night](/collections/quiznights/aq-matchpoint-trivial-pursuit/) at a new venue. We did not crush it.
- Thursday and Friday: Had to stay home and house-sit for most of these days. 
- No extra blog posts this past week!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Books: None finished this week. I am kind of nibbling on the start of a Discworld book, but I am not too into it yet.
- Comics: Current Thor runs are almost done! Also still trying to keep up with new comics.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Superman The Animated Series**, **Peacemaker S2**,, **Young Sheldon**. 
- Finished: 
    - **Poker Face** (2 seasons). This was fun, I look forward to writing the review.
    - **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**. One of the episodes this season might have been a series low.
- Started: **Only Murders In The Building S5**. I didn't know this had started already! I guess I have a cozy murder series to replace Poker Face.
- Movies: No new movies this week.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Chugging along.
    - **Magic Arena**: I am done with EOE drafting for now and am looking forward to the Spider-Man, er I mean "Through the Omenpaths" set releasing at the end of the month.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI**. I did sooo many sidequests this week; a few still remain. I expect I can finish the game either this week or the next.
    - Ongoing: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**. This game has eaten up so much of my time this week; it remains very hard. And I am still in Act 1!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 52,096 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Was a bit busier this week and it was a bit rainy again, so I'm glad I still got to 50k at least.

### Site Updates

When [I updated the site last month to be fully static](/2025/08/aug2025-site-updates/), I kept the comment forms open, but I did not yet hook it up to the queue I use to process/review incoming comments. The comments are being saved somewhere, I just had no way to approve them yet. The site very rarely receives comments via the web form, so this wasn't a priority. Today I finally got around to setting it all up. Only one web comment has been approved since that time, the rest were spam!

### Links to Share

I don't have anything here this week. Check the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Looking Forward

- We might be attending yet another quiz night this coming week.
- High Potential S2 drops this week!
