### Movies

These are all reviews I've posted to [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/), pulled into this post for the record.

#### Sunshine (2007)

Watched on 2025-07-04: ★★★½



{{% photos sunshine-2007 %}}

 This was intense, though for some reason in the third act they decided to transition to a slasher horror, as if they ran out of ideas for crises to throw at the crew. Also, why did they launch their mission with like the bare minimum crew and no backups? Like, why only 1 physicist who can detonate the payload? I liked the performances by Cillian Murphy and Rose Byrne.

#### Superman (2025)

Watched on 2025-07-09: ★★★★★



{{% photos superman-2025 %}}

 Superman was fantastic. I loved it especially as a comic book fan. James Gunn understood the assignment. I was worried about the large supporting cast being a distraction, but it all worked and they had their own things to do during the film.

I thought Brosnahan's Lois Lane was pitch perfect and reminded me a lot of past portrayals. Hoult's simmering and smouldering and obsessive Lex Luthor was great. Corenswet was pretty good too and he and Brosnahan had great chemistry. 

Looking forward to the rest of the new DCU!

#### Who Am I? (1998)

Watched on 2025-07-10: ★★★★



{{% photos who-am-i-1998 %}}

 One of Jacky's better movies. I liked the car chase scene and the sliding down the side of the building stunt and of course the fight scenes are great which is par for the course. But his character name is also Jackie Chan for some reason!

#### Lilo & Stitch (2002)

Watched on 2025-07-14: ★★★½



{{% photos lilo-stitch-2002 %}}

 Before watching this, I assumed Stitch was some dumb alien, turns out he's actually super smart. This was fun and okay but felt a bit trite. There is a character named Cobra Bubbles!

#### The Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)

Watched on 2025-07-25: ★★★★½



{{% photos the-fantastic-four-first-steps-2025 %}}

 Apparently fourth time is the charm because Fantastic Four First Steps is the best of the Fantastic Four movies so far. It is very much standalone and has a lot more heart and is more faithful to the source than it's predecessors. I think I still liked Superman better though

Props:  
- the setting was great  
- extremely standalone film  
- all the comic book callbacks and refs  
- excellent silver surfer animation and action scenes  
- reed being an anxious genius who worries a lot  
- johnny not being just an ignorant blowhard  
- an actual comic book accurate depiction of galactus!

  
Slops:  
- no alicia masters?!?  
- that final plan was kind of ridiculous lol

#### Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)

Watched on 2025-07-26: ★★★★



{{% photos avatar-the-way-of-water-2022 %}}

 The first Avatar felt like a groundbreaking technical breakthrough. This one felt like yet another cgi-fest in the modern sea of cgi-fests. IDK that we needed a sequel (let alone the other 3 additional planned films!), but the story was ok. Pretty much the same threat: humans being stupid and greedy. Except this movie has lots more water and the humans found something even more valuable than unobtanium to be greedy about, and also there are way more kids. It's all about family!

I am glad I didn't bother seeing this in the theatre; I don't think I am still capable of sitting through a 3 hour film.

#### Companion (2025)

Watched on 2025-07-29: ★★★★



{{% photos companion-2025 %}}

 I thought this was a different movie altogether (from a trailer I remember watching a while back), so I came in almost completely blind. I was not prepared for where the plot went and how dark it got and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Jack Quaid kind of still feels like he's playing Hughie from The Boys, but Sophie Thatcher was great.

#### Aliens (1986)

Watched on 2025-07-31: ★★★★½



{{% photos aliens-1986 %}}

 The last 30 minutes or so were very intense and the pacing all throughout was great. I didn't enjoy some of the blurry and constantly moving camera work, but I guess that's a horror genre thing.

#### The Naked Gun (2025)

Watched on 2025-08-15: ★★★★



{{% photos the-naked-gun-2025 %}}

 When a friend suggested we go watch this film, I said "Okay, but it looks ridiculous...". I almost immediately followed up with "The original was also ridiculous!" Expectations were met.

Some parts fell flat for me, but it's still a very funny movie. The sheer volume of jokes-per-second remind me of shows like 30 Rock. And a lot of it is like passing comments or quick visual gags in the background that you're going to miss if you don't pay attention.

There was one extended sequence (marked by a Starship song, you'll know it when you see it) that felt like it went in a ridiculous direction that felt weirdly out of place, like one of those Family Guy segue jokes that goes on just a little bit too long.

#### Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping (2016)

Watched on 2025-08-26: ★★★



{{% photos popstar-never-stop-never-stopping-2016 %}}

 I watched this because it's the same director as Naked Gun, and also I just finished a B99 rewatch. It's a funny movie, but I think I liked Naked Gun better. There was one gag about 30 seconds to Mars that I really liked lol.

I enjoyed all the celebrity cameos and I think the music industry satire was spot-on (from what little I know about it), though I'm not a big fan of most of the music genres represented, so I didn't really appreciate the music that much.

#### Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (2024)

Watched on 2025-08-28: ★★★½



{{% photos sonic-the-hedgehog-3-2024 %}}

 Had low expectations, but this was fine actually. Maybe a bit better than the second one. I'm surprised Jim Carrey came back for this one but he seems like he's having fun. And we get twice as much of him! Always nice to see Krysten Ritter. I did not know while watching that Keanu was voicing Shadow, but in retrospect, it makes sense.

#### The Thursday Murder Club (2025)

Watched on 2025-08-30: ★★★



{{% photos the-thursday-murder-club-2025 %}}

 This was... ok? Not terribly exciting for a whodunnit (maybe understandable considering the protagonists are all senior citizens), but I'm glad there was at least a couple of misdirects, though some of the sudden realizations at the end kind of felt like they came out of nowhere.

### TV

#### Iron Heart

Finished watching on 2025-07-06: ★★★

{{% photos ironhenry %}}

I am not super happy with the direction they took Riri in (admittedly I haven't read much of her in the comics to compare), but I can see what they were going for. Mephisto was great though. Also, the bad guys won WTH!

#### Rick and Morty S8

Finished watching on 2025-08-03: ★★★

Not sure what there is to say. I still enjoyed the show, but it's more of the same. I think my favorite ep of this season was Jerry going off to have multiversal adventures on his own in (S08E08 "Nomortland"). I wonder if this show manages to last as long as The Simpsons or even close to it; I'm not sure if they'd run out of goofy sci-fi premises first.

#### Brooklyn Nine-Nine (Rewatch)

Finished watching on 2025-08-24: ★★★★★

Most of this show still holds up great. The first 3-4 seasons are terrific and I love all of the characters and they all have their moments, even Hitchcock and Scully. I think it helps that Jake is so nerdy in his own immature way, but he's still a great cop. Andre Braugher's Holt was unmatched. The show lasted long enough to eventually be able to parody itself (the crew referencing Jake's Backstreet Boys cold open later on was a prime example). It jumped the shark a bit after Jake and Amy finally got married and I had forgotten that the last 2 seasons were so short and the last one had to deal with the fallout from Covid19 and the George Floyd anti-police stuff. It was okay, but at times felt a tad heavy-handed.
