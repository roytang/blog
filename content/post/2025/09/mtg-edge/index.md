New set *Spider-Man* / *Through The Omenpaths 1* drops this week on Arena, so here's my recap for the previous set **Edge of Eternities**.

<!--more-->

### Limited Summary / Notes

- I wasn't expecting to draft a lot of this set because I had spent so much of my currency drafting [Final Fantasy](/2025/08/mtg-final-fantasy/). However I still managed to do 28 total drafts, which is the 3rd highest number of drafts I've done for a set since I started tracking, narrowly edging out [Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty](/2022/03/mtgneo-limited-recap/). *Final Fantasy* and [Dragonstorm](/2025/06/mtg-dragonstorm/) were no. 1 and no. 2 respectively, which means my top 3 most-drafted sets of all time were all in 2025. It's honestly because limited environments today are so fun and well-designed!
- EOE was no exception. I was a bit meh on new mechanics like `Station` during previews as a lot of the cards seemed overcosted, but turns out they play really well. 
- I enjoyed most of the draft archetypes as well, only doing poorly with two of the ten - BG and UR.
- Thankfully, my win rate was much better than the last two sets. I think I managed to peak at around 60% before late-season experimentation brought it down to a healthy 56.42%. The higher win rate helped me get more drafts out of limited currency.
- During this season, I managed to hit Diamond rank twice. I tried pushing to mythic both times (I have never hit limited mythic), but it's just way too much of a grind and I was working with limited resources.
- Despite the good win rate, I still haven't gotten a 5th trophy (I think I almost always max out at 4), and the 7-0 achievement remains elusive (I have done this before the achievements were implemented though)

### 7-x Draft Decks

### Constructed Notes

{{% photos mythic %}}

- Also managed to hit Mythic at the end of August. I got to play a lot of constructed since the low resources after FIN meant I needed to grind a bit to earn more currency to draft. At first I was running some Koma/Omniscience nonsense in Standard (it was fun!) and Mobilize in Alchemy, but once I was in Diamond, I loaded up the current soon-to-be-nerfed UR Vivi Cauldron deck for the grind to mythic. It takes so many games to climb from diamond to mythic, but at least in constructed it doesn't cost currency!

### Magic Arena Stats

Will update this section once I get the stats email.

### Streaming videos

- I wasn't expecting to draft a lot of this set, so I didn't bother streaming anything.

### Next

The next set is the online version of the *Spider-Man* set, *Through The Omenpaths 1* I think is the name? I'll do my commentary on this whole digital license issue nonsense in the set recap for that set.
