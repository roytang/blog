Since I don't have a PS5, *Final Fantasy XVI* is the first game of the franchise I played on PC (via Steam). The game came out in 2023, so this is also the first time I am playing an FF game so far from its release day since I started buying them myself. This review will have spoilers, suitably marked.

I got the game on Steam Sale earlier this year and started playing it a few months ago to coincide with the release of [the MTG Final Fantasy set](/2025/08/mtg-final-fantasy/).

### Technical Issues

The main problem with the Steam release however, is that it is plagued with technical and performance issues. Notably:

- very bad framerate drops and stuttering often in cutscenes and sometimes during game play as well
- the game takes a very long time to launch and then a very long time to even load my save
- long loading times between areas
- sometimes the game will crash so hard trying to load my save that it will take Steam down with it!

Now, [I don't have a top end PC](/2022/12/pc-build-2022/) so that may be part of the problem. I am already playing on the lowest graphics settings I think. But the performance issues for the PC version are [widely reported](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ff16+steam+performance+issues&t=newext&atb=v353-1&ia=web) so I think it's more the fault of a suboptimal port than anything else which is very disappointing.

### Story

A lot of the reviews I see online praise the game for it's darker themes and more serious tone, but it's kind of meh for me. I think they were going for a more Game of Thrones-style world with all of these politics and the kingdoms, but all of it felt largely uninteresting as the main plot chugged along. I never really ended up exploring the detailed in-game encyclopedia (provided by 2 NPCs).

The main plot I found to be a bit idiotic. Story spoilers:

{{% spoiler %}}

Clive's stated goals are mostly adoped from Cid: (a) to make life better for bearers and (b) to destroy all the mother crystals. (a) sounds good but he never actually does anything important to change the systemic racism that is at the root of it; and (b) is worse; Clive basically blindly accepts Cid's conspiracy theory about the mothercrystals causing the blight without doing any sort of validation, and at the very end of the game, they find out that's what the big bad wanted all along!

{{% /spoiler %}}

I did like the game following Clive as he grew up and how many of the side quests were used to expound on the back stories of NPCs you meet. (Although none of them were particularly interesting.)

### Graphics

I rarely complain about graphics, but this game just didn't do it for me. A lot of the character models and designs feel bland, especially for the women (Benedikta looks like Zidane lol). The game overall feels very drab and gray graphics-wise. And I have the sense that FF15 looked and felt better 8 years ago! Part of that may be because I had to lower my graphics settings, but even when watching videos of the game online I feel unimpressed.

### Combat and Gameplay

How far we have wandered away from ye olde Active Time Battle. The combat now is almost entirely action-oriented; very little RPG even. It feels a lot more Devil May Cry than anything before. You are always controlling Clive, and you often have your dog Torgal ("a fine hound", as everyone keeps saying) for support, doling out additional attacks and very small heals when he can. Sometimes you also have 1 or 2 companions fighting alongside you. TBH, I never felt the impact of any of these other "party members", as the vast majority of combat work and damage has to come from Clive. I understand why it works that way, but it's just another way the game doesn't feel very Final Fantasy. In FF15, at least Gladio, Prompto and Ignis felt like important parts of your entourage; here the other party members are just... there.

I am not a particularly big fan of the combat system. You are either fighting large numbers of mobs or single bosses with stagger meters and way too much HP. Frankly, the first types of fights can be more interesing. The boss fights with stagger bars tend to be very "same-y"; when I went through the final S-level hunts I was so bored because each one was the same "keep attacking until staggered then attack some more" pattern. The only difference between most fights was when and how to dodge the enemy attacks, but that isn't a particularly interesting endeavor.

The more interesting fights are the cinematic Eikon battles. They're epic and scale and often accompanied by an appropriate soundtrack. They feel great, though gameplay wise, they are largely just vehicles for quick-time events.

The game is less of an action RPG more "action game with RPG elements", and some of those RPG elements feel a bit tacked on just for the sake of tradition. For example: I don't know why they still show me Clive's stat growth on level up. I have no control over these and he's the only party member so they don't really affect my decision-making in any way. His weapon/armor loadouts are straightforward and always just "equip the highest attack/defense"; there are no considerations for status effects or elemental damage or anything like that. I don't even know why they bothered having shops that sell weapons and armor; you never buy them since the best ones are crafted at Clive's hideaway.

The game is divided into several open-world map areas, representing each of the major powers/kingdoms, but exploration is largely unrewarding. It's not too exciting finding a hidden treasure chest when it's always something ridiculous like "20 bloody pelts" which you already have way too many of or maybe maybe an accessory that very sligtly reduces the cooldown for an ability you don't use.

Side quests are meh, though they do help provide back story for a number of the NPCs you meet, but they're very often just "go fight these monsters" etc. You also have a monster hunt board (manned by the only Moogle in the game).

### Completion

Despite all my complaints, I still managed to sink 60.7 hours into the game and complete 40/69 achievements. For the first time however, I do not feel compelled to keep playing for completion's sake. I didn't even hit the level cap during my main run!

### Overall

Overall, generally unhappy with the game. The loading times meant even launching the game felt like a slog and a chore that I had to get through. I still finished it out of a sense of franchise loyalty but I'm not happy with where they are taking it. 

The game isn't bad per se. It just doesn't feel like the sort of game I want to play when I play a "Final Fantasy game". Sigh. 

I'm gonna uninstall it right after I post this review, because it also takes up way too much space!
