★★★★

I've been hearing good things about the TV show adaptation of this one and then I remembered I had a copy of the first book from like Tor EBook Club or some such, so I decided to give it a whirl. Was surprised to find out it was so short! Turns out the books in the series are novellas. Finished this in like 2 sittings. (Would have been just the one sitting if not for my terrible attention span.)

Despite how short it was, I enjoyed it. I found the Murderbot just wanting to half-ass his job and watch his tv shows very relatable, and the story being told from the POV of his internal dialogue was great. And despite a tight plot involving a science team surveying a remote planet, we get a decent glimpse at how their universe works for some background world-building. I liked the science guys too, especially the one who bought out his contract at the end. Murderbot parted ways with them at the end, but I hope they see each other again at some point.
