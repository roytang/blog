title: Have You Done The Best You Can?
---

When you are going through a crisis or the world is on fire or your country just put a Nazi into power or any other situation where there's a lot of uncertainty over what's going to happen or how you're going to be able to deal with things, it is easy to be overwhelmed by fear or anxiety or stress.

Recently I found myself in a similar situation, and what I did was I opened up my notes app of choice and wrote down a new entry with just two questions on it:

- Have you done the best you can?
- Is it something you can control?

I found this strangely comforting. When I felt overwhelmed by everything I would open up this particular note and I would remember that I am already doing the best I can and managing what I can control. Everything else is out of my hands and worrying or stressing myself over things out of my control does not do me any good.

One day at a time. Focus only on what matters. This too shall pass.
