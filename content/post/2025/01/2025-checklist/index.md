title: My 2025 Checklist
toc: true
---

Something I've gotten used to as the New Year rolls in: make a checklist of things to do and things I'm looking forward to for the new year.  This is my personal list, but maybe you'll enjoy going through it too. Check out the [new-years-checklist tag](/tags/new-years-checklist/) for previous years.

This entry is coming in quite late this year. Honestly given recent family events I am not yet feeling the "new year" spirit, but here we go...

### New year reminders

These are general reminders that I think anyone would find useful. (I generally copy stuff over, but the list changes a bit every year.)

- Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful
- Change your passwords
- Throw away a few things you no longer need
- Audit your financials -- where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc
    - Review your recurring luxury costs (Netflix, etc) and evaluate whether you still really need them
- Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that's gathered there over the past year
- Choose something from the past year that you're going to stop watching or doing or move on from
- Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great!
- Replace 2024 calendars
- Digital housekeeping
    - Delete all files downloaded 2022 or earlier
    - Clean up the photos on your phone, tablet and computer
    - Backup/archive all important content
    - Check your backups
    - Export your data from platforms like Google, FB, Instagram and Twitter
- Make sure to see a doctor every so often
- Follow up on the people who owe you money or things
- Forgive those who have wronged you
- Speak truth to power
- Seek beauty and wonder in this harsh world
- Be kind
- Reach out to your friends more often
- Relax, give yourself room to breathe and grow.
- Buy a new toothbrush
- Focus only on what matters
- Do not obey in advance
- Quit social media, run your own blog, write anything you want

### My specific goals

This section is a thing I started in [2023](/2023/01/2023-checklist/) and I used [the 2024 yearnotes](/2025/01/2024-year-in-review/) to evaluate how well I did with last year's goals. These are more specific yes/no measurable goals than the ones above. I'll be a bit more ambitious this year and put some long-simmering ideas on here.

First priority: Survive.

Everything else is secondary:

- Buy and ride a bike. This is something I've wanted to do for a while.
- Take a solo foreign trip. This may just be me wanting to destress after my recent troubles, but I've been thinking about going to Japan again soon, by myself.
- Start sketching again.
- Listen to more music and more of it should be new to me. (If you look at [my listening stats](/page/stats/listening/), this would obviously be a big change.)
- Submit a crossword to the NYT.
- Start using OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps where possible.
- Release a podcast.
- Gamedev: 1 Gamedev project
- Site changes:
    - Notes cleanup (will elaborate on this in a future blog post)
    - Collections (this too!)
- General room cleaning. Specifics:
    - Go through the boxes behind the bed, toss out what isn't needed
    - Go through the drawers
    - Toss out at least 6 booster boxes worth of MTG draft chaff
    - Figure out what to do with the SmartThings things
- Archival work
    - Continue/finish [scanning old photographs](/2023/04/old-photographs/)
    - Continue my secret scanning projects
- SECRET GOAL #1
- SECRET GOAL #2


### Entertainment

#### Games

New releases I'm looking forward to:

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Feb 11 | Civilization VII | PC | Not yet sure if I am getting it on release date, but I did so for V and VI, so there is a good chance. |
| Feb 18 | Avowed | PC | [Starfield](/2024/11/starfield/) taught me that I will generally enjoy anything even remotely Skyrim-shaped, so I wanna play this one too. Hoping it comes out on PC Game Pass! |

I am hoping to watch more movies this coming year though!

#### Books

No new books I'm anticipating this year. I'm still reading **Wind and Truth**! And there are still a lot of comics to read!

### Others

Once again, my goals for the year remain unambitious. It's hard to make plans when there is a lot of stuff going on in the household that I have to deal with. The most important thing: SURVIVE!!
