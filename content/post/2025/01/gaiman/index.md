> The Vulture article on Neil Gaiman's decades of rape and abuse is chilling. What a fucking monster. Given his influence the bravery of the women he attacked cannot be overstated. https://www.vulture.com/article/neil-gaiman-allegations-controversy-amanda-palmer-sandman-madoc.html

Honestly I couldn't make it halfway through the article, it's quite brutal. If even a small part of these allegations were true it would already be deplorable.

I have read some [Gaiman](/tags/gaiman/), though not as much as some of my high school/college peers, many of whom were big fans of his Sandman comics. When the Netflix adaptation came out, I refused to watch it in order to maintain my status as "the one who had never read or watched Sandman" among our group, and I guess now I'm glad I didn't watch it and probably never will. 

A couple of years ago a high school friend passed away; he was the one who introduced me to Gaiman, and I'm kind of glad he didn't live to see these allegations come to light, it would have made him sad.

*(Another friend commented that if Terry Pratchett were ever revealed to be a bastard, it would shatter them. Fortunately, Pratchett has been gone for almost a decade now and no such allegations have come forward, so he remains one of the good ones.)*

It's a weird thing when the creator of works you have enjoyed is revealed to be not a very good person. How are you supposed to feel now about those works you previously enjoyed? Whatever impression they left on you changes and is now soured. Should you throw away those books? Delete the glowing reviews? Does it make you a horrible person too?

For many people, the primary example of this kind of thing would probably be JK Rowling coming out as a TERF. For me, the prime example is Orson Scott Card, writer of the Ender's Game series of books. I [binge-read most of the books back in 2007](/2007/09/enders-game-series/) (they were excellent company for when I was watching over trainees) and only found out many years later that [he is a card-carrying homophone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orson_Scott_Card#Homosexuality). Even then I wasn't sure how to handle it. I [still watched the movie](/2014/12/movies-2014/#enders-game-2013), though I wasn't too happy with the adaptation.

There is an argument (I believe largely unsettled) on whether we should be able to separate the art from the artist. It's difficult especially in Gaiman's case where the abuse has apparently been going on for a long time. Their works were undoubtedly tinged, if not outright influenced by their horrible actions. I don't think you can change how a work has influenced you in the past, but it definitely means I won't be looking at any future works and probably won't be re-reading any of the older ones either.

Annie Mueller writes about this more succinctly than I can in [When you love something made by a terrible person](https://anniemueller.com/posts/when-you-love-something-made-by-a-terrible-person):

I still have copies of some of Gaiman's books around here somewhere, not sure what I'm gonna do with them. It would feel weird to sell or give them away to someone knowing what we know now, as that feels like an implicit recommendation.
