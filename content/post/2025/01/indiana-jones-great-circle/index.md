**Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** wasn't on my radar for new games to play in 2025, so it was a pleasant surprise when it became available on PC Game Pass and it turned out to be an excellent game.

The game is similar to the Uncharted series of games, except with a few open-world areas for Indiana Jones to roam around in and collect collectibles (sooo many secrets and collectibles!) and undertake quests and fight Nazis and so on. Fighting nazis is more of a last resort, though certainly one you can go crazy with if you like. I prefered to use stealth where possible. I am typically pretty bad at 3d stealth games because I am impatient, but the stealth mechanics here were relatively forgiving. When you do have to fight, I prefered fisticuffs to using guns (as I imagine the real Indiana Jones would), especially since any gunshots you fire seem to raise alarms and get even more Nazis coming your way.

The game looks great, though I didn't take a lot of screenshots. I think they did a good job of capturing Indy's character model and Troy Baker did a good job with his voice. The game's story feels very much in line with the tone of the films, though I doubt an adaptation could be made as the game is quite long. Indy travels all around the world, visiting different areas, and even has to fly out of a warzone during a bombing raid at one point.

Overall the game is superfun and really makes you feel like an adventurous and exasperated archaeology professor.

In terms of completion, the game is very friendly, allowing you to revisit previous areas to collect missed items or finish quests. (This was one annoyance I always had with the Uncharted games!). There's a journal that is great at keeping track of things, and you can buy "guides" in-game that help you find collectibles.

The only annoying achievement was the "collect all notes" one, not only because there are a lot of them to collect (and they are very easy to miss), but also the achievement itself seems to be bugged and I had to search online for a workaround when it initially didn't pop.

Final playtime clocked in at just under 43 hours, which was a lot longer than I expected. When I started I thought it would be like a 15-20 hour game and I could finish it before 2024 ended! Instead the last chapter and some completion stuff got pushed to January. Still, not a bad game to start the year with!
