title: Weeknotes 2025-01-05 Not Off To A Great Start
toc: true
---

Somehow the week of New Year's Day ended up even worse for me than I expected. 

Monday was already stressful in trying to schedule the week's medical errands; Tuesday I tried to relax and take it easy a bit for NYE rituals. On Wednesday all planning was thrown in the air when one of my patients had to be rushed and admitted to the hospital, and of course I am once again The Watcher. 

That's right, I have spent 100% of 2025 so far at the hospital. My year is not off to a great start.

As such, this first weeknotes of the year will be brief and without any real format. Hopefully by next week I am in a better position to write more.

I wrote last week that my usual New Year's Posts may be delayed; well, it looks like they will be delayed even more than I expected!

I did manage a bit more than 30k+ steps this week in spite of all the problems. Also waiting at the hospital a lot meant I was able to complete this week's High Voltage event in **Marvel Snap**. Not much else in terms of reading, writing or playing though.

Cheers, and I hope you are having a better 2025 so far than I am.

Oh alright, maybe a few links from [the link blog](/links/), as a treat:

    This post contains a webcomic (formerly on The Nib) about the efforts to revive sail cargo, a more environment-friendly method of transportation.

    On maintaining site archives:

    > "You don’t have to like everything in your archive. Because archives are a kaleidoscope of your life. They aren’t just a reflection of how you are now. They are you now, a year ago, five years ago, ten years ago. They are how you were, are, and perhaps a hint of what you may become. That’s the sheer joy and magic of them. To snip and prune misses the whole point."

    > "I just ask people to consider: there are many different audiences for your work. The actual author is just one of them. You might not like what your old self has to say any more… but it could be exactly what somebody else needed to read right at that very moment. It could inspire somebody to make something truly great. Everything links together, and who knows where the internet’s complex web of ideas might end up?"
