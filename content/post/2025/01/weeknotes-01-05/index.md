title: Weeknotes 2025-01-05 Not Off To A Great Start
toc: true

Somehow the week of New Year's Day ended up even worse for me than I expected. 

Monday was already stressful in trying to schedule the week's medical errands; Tuesday I tried to relax and take it easy a bit for NYE rituals. On Wednesday all planning was thrown in the air when one of my patients had to be rushed and admitted to the hospital, and of course I am once again The Watcher. 

That's right, I have spent 100% of 2025 so far at the hospital. My year is not off to a great start.

As such, this first weeknotes of the year will be brief and without any real format. Hopefully by next week I am in a better position to write more.

I did manage a bit more than 30k+ steps this week in spite of all the problems. Also waiting at the hospital a lot meant I was able to complete this week's High Voltage event in **Marvel Snap**. Not much else in terms of reading, writing or playing though.

Cheers, and I hope you are having a better 2025 so far than I am.
