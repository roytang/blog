This is a personal year in review. You can check the [yearnotes tag](/tags/yearnotes) for previous years-in-review. Last year's review is [here](/2024/01/2023-year-in-review/).

### Other People's 2024

The World: Continues to be horrible. I think the fact that Donald Trump was convicted of 34 felonies and yet still managed to get elected once again as President of the US after an electoral season with multiple surprise twists says it all about 2024. Democracies around the world faced numerous crises, from South Korea's failed martial law declaration to France's PM getting ousted in a no-confidence vote. OTOH, long-time Syrian tyrant Assad has been ousted from Damascus. Russia's war with Ukraine continues, as does Israel's ongoing genocide in Gaza. Once more, record high temperatures.

The Philippines: The UniTeam alliance that dominated the last elections has fallen apart, as VP Duterte is now openly antagonistic against the president. Controversial Bambang mayor Alice Guo accused of being a Chinese spy. Duterte's favorite pastor Quiboloy becomes subject of US extradition and becomes a fugitive. Marcos bans POGOs. Lots of people glued to their screens watching Senate/Congressional hearings. China continues to harass us in our own territory. Our summer was punishingly hot.

In Tech: Wordpress founder Matt Mullenwegg went publicly batshit crazy late in the year over a feud with WPEngine. So much "AI"-related hype and BS. Tiktok about to be banned from the US (unless saved by Trump or the Supreme Court). BlueSky is a big winner among post-Twitter competitors, soaking up most of the migrations from Elon's Nazi Bar. Cohost and Post have shut down. A Crowdstrike outage took out multiple systems worldwide, including many airlnes.

In Culture: Akira Toriyama passed away at 68.

### My 2024

#### Medical Errands

This year for me was mostly about medical errands. At the start of the year I was mostly managing one patient (Patient#1) with some support for a second one (Patient#2). Patient#1's medical concerns were expected to ease up as we head into 2025, but in December the universe decided we didn't have enough troubles and somehow our household managed to earn a third patient (Patient#3). There are only 4 people in the household! Sigh, I thought I would get to take it easy in 2025...

Patient#1 needed the most attention this year, with immunotherapy cycles every 21 days. Aside from the actual sessions, there were often labs and consultations to attend. I also spent a good amount of time trying to navigate the byzantine and constantly-changing pathways of trying to get financial/medical assistance from our government. 

In September, we had two scares which resulted in short hospital stays during back-to-back weeks. 

All-in-all, I guesstimate that for at least maybe roughly 90 days out of 365, I had to go to a hospital/clinic. That is around a quarter of the year!! I thought about parsing my Google Timeline export to see how accurate that guess is (I suspect the number to be higher), but I haven't gotten around to it yet and maybe will update this post when I do.

#### Some Events

In February, we ditched SkyCable for Cignal. In March we had some renovations done in the house that had me booted from my room for a few days. In October I finally had enough and deactivated my Twitter accounts. 

The highlight of my year was [my two-week vacation to Japan with friends in November](/2024/12/japan2024/). (Honestly I am already tempted to go back to Japan.) That and whenever my *pamangkins* come visit of course.

At the end of 2024, one of my brothers and his family migrated to another country. This is a first for our family and it was a very emotional and bittersweet farewell during Christmas.

#### Other Things

Financially, 2024 took a larger chunk out of my savings than 2023 did. My bigger expenses for the year were the above-mentioned vacation and contributions to family medical expenses. Despite that, I am still in a pretty good spot savings-wise.

Professionally, this was another hiatus year for me (see work stats below), same as last year. That is the fourth one in a row! Once again, I am glad to be blessed with the privilege to live a bit separate from the capitalist grind like this, but my anxiety about how I might find it difficult to actually get work again is still increasing. The constant need to suddenly need to be available to assist one of my patients makes the prospect of looking for full-time work again very challenging, though the increased expenses are making me more likely to consider it.

When I'm not doing medical errands, I spent a lot of time on movies, tv shows, books and comics (see below). And also [website gardening](/2024/10/website-gardening/); I have some content reorganization I have been working on and was hoping to release in December, but alas life got in the way.

At the end of the year, [botsin.space decided to shut down](https://muffinlabs.com/posts/2024/10/29/10-29-rip-botsin-space/), so [the Mastodon triviabot is no longer available](https://triviastorm.net/blog/post/farewell-botsinspace/). I plan to migrate it to a different server when I have the time.

### 2024 Goals

In [last year's checklist post](/2024/01/2024-checklist/), I set some goals for myself for 2024, let's see how I did:

- Site changes:
    - General redesign. DONE. I actually forgot already, but I [posted about it back in April](/2024/04/2024-site-update/).
    - Notes cleanup: ONGOING. The website gardening post talks about this a bit.
    - Collections: ONGOING. This is part of the content re-org I've been meaning to release.
- General room cleaning: NOPROGRESS.
- Archival work
    - Continue/finish [scanning old photographs](/2023/04/old-photographs/): ONGOING. Kinda stalled.
- Cash out at an Arena open: FAILED.
- Gamedev: NOPROGRESS.
    - Do a yearlong gamedev project: FAILED.
- Travel to Japan (Nov): DONE!

### 2024 In Numbers

Once again, the main reason this post took a while to come out is that I took some time to put these stats together.

#### Work, Travel, Learning

- Hours worked: 0, same as last year.
    - This was my fourth hiatus year in a row! I am privileged that I can live this way, but I'm starting to worry about how this will be a problem if I ever decide to go working again.
- Programming languages/frameworks learned: 0 (0 last year). :sadface:
- Duolingo streak: 2172 days (from 1808 last year). 
    - There was a Duolingo year in review, and they leaned into the threatening vibe this year:
  
        {{< photos duolingo >}}
        
- Other countries visited: 1
    - [I went to Japan late in the year](/2024/12/japan2024/), one of the few bright spots of the year.

#### On this site

- 126 [blog posts](/blog/), 107,887 words worth; from 151 posts and 114,812 words last year. Below are some of the 2024 ones I really liked (that aren't weeknotes or reviews):

    - I managed to watch all but 4 of [the films on my 2023 checklist](/2023/01/2023-checklist/#movies) this year, though not all of them in the cinema. Two were delayed to 2024.

    - I picked up Brandon Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** late in the year, but have not made much progress into it.
    - I wish I had the time/energy/inclination to read more books.
- **TV/Streaming**
    - [Here's the list](/lists/media/tv/2024/) of all the TV shows I've written about this year.
        - I wrote about 25 shows this year, down from 28 last year. A lot of them were very good! Some favorites for 2024: [Shogun](/2024/04/shoguntv/), [Gravity Falls](/2024/08/movies-tv-jun-jul-2024/#gravity-falls), [Boston Legal](/2024/12/movies-tv-oct-dec-2024/#boston-legal), [Star Trek: Lower Decks](/2024/12/movies-tv-oct-dec-2024/#star-trek-lower-decks), [Ranma 1/2](/2024/12/movies-tv-oct-dec-2024/#ranma-1-2), [Dandadan](/2024/12/movies-tv-oct-dec-2024/#dandadan).
- **Comics**
    - I wrote about some comics this year: [the 2024 list](/lists/media/comics/2024/).
    - [The Complete Marvel Run](/tags/complete-marvel-run): Currently up to 14.54%, from 10.24% last year. Progress is slow.
    - Still true: I actually read a lot more comics than the above links imply, since I read more than I have time to write about. For Marvel, we will catch up eventually, Still need to write more about DC.
    - For non-Marvel/DC comics, my favorites this year were both by Daniel Warren Johnson: [Do A Powerbomb](/2024/03/powerbomb/) from 2023 and the current Image/Skybound **Transformers** ongoing, which I have yet to write about.
- **Music**
    - 2024 was a weird year for music. It seems like I listened to much less music than I used to.
    - My Spotify Wrapped tells me I only listened to 789 minutes of music in 2024, way down from 4561 minutes in 2023:
        {{< photos spotify >}}
    - This year I found out that last.fm has a recap of the last year of listening. Mine is [here](https://www.last.fm/user/roytang/listening-report/year). It has a bunch of charts and everything, I love that sort of thing! Unfortunately, the data source for last.fm is my Spotify account, so I don't have a lot of data to work with. I'd have loved to have these charts when I was listening to music more often!
        {{< photos lastfm >}}
    - Music tracks played (Spotify/LastFM): 391 (2,029 last year). 
    - This year I was also able to generate a year-end summary from Youtube Music, since I also often listen to music on Youtube:
        {{< photos youtubemusic >}}
    - Youtube only logged 1454 minutes of music in 2024. Even combined with the spotify total, that's still way down from 2023!
    - I have a [listening stats page](/page/stats/listening/), but uh... I have to figure out how I want to merge the Spotify/Youtube stats first before updating for 2024.

#### Gaming

I did my gaming writeup separately and ahead of time this year: [my 2024 gaming roundup](/2024/12/2024-gaming-roundup/).

#### Trivia Team

- In 2024, we attended 16 [quiz nights](/tags/quiznight/), down from 18 last year. The highlight was probably winning the [Geekfight League Final](/2024/01/geekfight-league-final/) at the start of the year!
- Win rate: 8 wins, a solid 50% win rate, compared to 33% the previous year.
- By host:
    - Popquiz: 6
    - Jason @ Don Conejos: 4
    - TriviaDown: 2
    - Geekfight: 2
    - Cinema 76: 1
    - SmartyPants: 1
- NYT crosswords: Unfortunately, I broke the NYT crossword streak TWICE this year. The longest streak record stands at 1014, almost THREE YEARS!! It will take a while to build that back up again.
- The Trivia Team has a YT channel, [@teamcamoteph](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph) where we upload recordings of the above shenanigans and other gaming and puzzle things. We uploaded 54 videos in 2024, up from 38 videos in 2023. Most of that were recordings of us playing Cine2Nerdle!

#### Food

- New section because I added [a food stats page](/page/stats/food/) this year!
- Donuts eaten: 9 donuts, up from 7 last year!
- Top fast food restaurants this year, by spend:
    - Pizza Hut (39 meals, P4,919.60)
    - Jollibee (20 meals, P3,414.00)
    - Shakey's (5 meals, P2,725.00): I think we were just trying to maximize our Supercard lol

#### Others

- Steps/Activity:
    - Year total: 3,222,672 steps, up from 3,182,165 steps in 2023. That's an average of 8,829 steps per day. Only a slight bump, but that's good enough for now. The trip to Japan helped, but I kind of slacked off in December.
- Baptisms attended: 0, from 0 last year
- Weddings attended: 0, from 0 last year
- Wakes attended: 1; this was a friend's mom.
- New pamangkins: 0
- Grab:
    - Trips: 44 (!!) way up from 18 last year. This was mostly because of medical errands where I had to accompany one or both of the parents to some appointment, so regular taxis weren't an option.
    - Food delivery: 4, up from 1 last year. This was mostly because I got free discount codes from Globe rewards I think.
    - Express delivery: 3, from 1 last year. Again, this was just to send out stuff to some family members.
- Bears defeated in single combat: 0
- Tips received via [my profile on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/roytang): None this year. I'll still accept donations happily!

### The future

One last statistic: this year's yearnotes is about 33% shorter than last year's, probably because I decided to separate the gaming stats this year!

For me, the year in review post is about the past year. My next post will be my 2025 checklist, where I talk about the future and things I'm looking forward to in the coming year.
