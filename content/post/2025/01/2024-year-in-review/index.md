This is a personal year in review. You can check the [yearnotes tag](/tags/yearnotes) for previous years-in-review. Last year's review is [here](/2024/01/2023-year-in-review/).

### Essay-writing section

Last year I said that "2022 felt like an extension of 2021" and actually, 2023 ended up being more of the same I think.

For the world, it was another challenging year. The Israel and Hamas conflict added yet another geopolitical hotspot on top of Russia's still ongoing war with Ukraine. Elon Musk presided over the demise of Twitter. Record-breaking writer and actor strikes shut down Hollywood for a few months. Lots of layoffs in the tech world. Another year of record-high temperatures. Trump's legal troubles escalate. Elon and Zuck promised us a cage match and never pushed through. PinoyExchange suddenly shut down! "AI" / LLMs became the new big tech bubble / scam.

There were practically no more Covid restrictions in the country this year, though I still mask whenever I go to any crowded indoor place. I still stayed at home a lot though. Despite my being careful, I had [my second bout of Covid in October](/2023/10/2023-week-40/). No idea where I got it from, but at least no one else in the house got it too

In July, [my phone was stolen](/2023/07/stolen-phone/).

In September, there was a big fire in our subdivision in the early morning, apparently someone was running an illegal garments shop. It made the news cycle for a couple of weeks, and the barangay outpost guarding the "crime scene" was only dismantled in the last week of 2023.

Also in September, I spent a week in the hospital taking care of my mom who underwent surgery.

In November and December, I had to deal with a bunch of government bureaucracy hoping to get some financial assistance for upcoming family medical expenses, failing miserably.

Late in the year, my brother gifted us a new ref! The previous one was still working fine but was more than 20 years old - we had brought it over from the old house when we moved here in 2001. The new one promises to be more energy efficient, and sure enough, our electricity bill for December was lower by a nontrivial amount! 

Financially, my savings dipped a bit, as could be expected, but the overall situation remains stable. This year's expenses were a bit higher than last year, mostly because I chipped in a bit to help with family medical expenses. Other than family stuff, my only major expenses of the year were replacing the stolen phone and also [buying new glasses](/2023/02/progressives/) early in the year. (I did also take a trip to Singapore early this year, but the flight expenses were booked late 2022.)

Professionally, this was another hiatus year for me (see work stats below), same as last year. Repeating from last year: privilege, tired of capitalism, [wandering through life finding interesting things](/2021/06/life-philosophy/), etc. In last year's post I mentioned that "I have been thinking of already looking for new part-time or full-time work this coming year"; that did not come to pass. I also mentioned that "I do worry that maybe taking a third hiatus year in a row would be like crossing a rubicon that I can never come back from," which I guess I'm going to find out if that was true. I have still been thinking about looking for work again, but I can't make any promises.

Some projects I can talk about publicly: I [started scanning old family photographs](/2023/04/old-photographs/) and [I moved the Triviastorm trivia bot to Mastodon](/2023/02/triviastorm-mastodon/) after Twitter started to break down.

I still felt like 2023 was a bad year overall for me, mostly due to the family medical issues that cropped up. (Not keen on sharing too many details but I do talk about this a bit in [Being Mortal](/2023/12/being-mortal/).) It's possible that I just let that sort of thing weigh too heavily on me though; there were also a lot of good things that happened to me this year; a lot of it was getting to see old friends and relatives more often.

### 2024 In Numbers

Once again, the main reason this post took a while to come out is that I took some time to put these stats together.

#### Work, Travel, Learning and Self Improvement

- Hours worked: 0, same as last year.
    - This was my fourth hiatus year in a row! I am privileged that I can live this way, but I'm starting to worry about how this will be a problem if I ever decide to go working again.
- Programming languages/frameworks learned: 0 (0 last year). :sadface:
- Duolingo streak: 2172 days (from 1808 last year). 
    - There was a Duolingo year in review, and they leaned into the threatening vibe this year:
  
        {{< photos duolingo >}}
        
- Other countries visited: 1
    - [I went to Japan late in the year](/2024/12/japan2024/), one of the few bright spots of the year.

#### On this site

- 126 [blog posts](/blog/), 107,887 words worth; from 151 posts and 114,812 words last year. Below are some of the 2024 ones I really liked (that aren't weeknotes or reviews):

Also, here's a wordcloud for 2024:

{{< img src="wordcloud2024.png" >}}

(Somehow these remain largely the same year after year?)

    - [The list.](/lists/media/movies/2024/)
    - Watched 2 movies in the cinema this year, down from 8 last year. Those 2 were [Dune: Part Two](/2024/04/movies-tv-feb-mar-2024/#dune-part-two-2024) and [Deadpool and Wolverine](/2024/08/movies-tv-jun-jul-2024/#deadpool-wolverine-2024).
    - I managed to watch all but 4 of [the films on my 2023 checklist](/2023/01/2023-checklist/#movies) this year, though not all of them in the cinema. Two were delayed to 2024.
    - My favorite films I watched this year: 
        - [The First Slam Dunk](/2024/06/slam-dunk/#the-first-slam-dunk-2022)

        - [Deadpool and Wolverine](/2024/08/movies-tv-jun-jul-2024/#deadpool-wolverine-2024)
        - [The Fall Guy](/2024/10/movies-tv-aug-sep-2024/#the-fall-guy-2024)
    - All my reviews are also still on [my Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/films/diary/)! 
- **Books** read: 8, same as last year
    - [The list](/lists/media/books/2024/), with 6 fiction and 2 nonfiction. (Same breakdown as last year!)
    - I picked up Brandon Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** late in the year, but have not made much progress into it.
- **TV/Streaming**
    - [Here's the list](/lists/media/tv/2024/) of all the TV shows I've written about this year.
        - I wrote about 25 shows this year, down from 28 last year. A lot of them were very good!
- **Comics**
    - I wrote about some comics this year: [the 2024 list](/lists/media/comics/2024/).
    - [The Complete Marvel Run](/tags/complete-marvel-run): Currently up to 14.54%, from 10.24% last year. Progress is slow.
    - Still true: I actually read a lot more comics than the above links imply, since I read more than I have time to write about. For Marvel, we will catch up eventually, Still need to write more about DC.
    - For non-Marvel/DC comics, my favorites this year were both by Daniel Warren Johnson: [Do A Powerbomb](/2024/03/powerbomb/) from 2023 and the current Image/Skybound **Transformers** ongoing, which I have yet to write about.
- **Music**
    - ##: TODO
    - Music tracks played (Spotify/LastFM): 2029. (884 last year). See [listening stats here](/page/stats/listening/). 
    - [Here's my 2023 Spotify Wrapped](/2023/12/111509729930849977/).
    - This year's listening stats are a bit of an anomaly because for a good part of the year I had my Spotify account hooked up to the Amazon Echo in the living room which my mom basically uses as a radio, so it includes her track selections.
    - I also still listened to a lot of music via YT, which I have no way of tracking.

#### Gaming

I did my gaming writeup separately and ahead of time this year: [my 2024 gaming roundup](/2024/12/2024-gaming-roundup/).

#### Trivia Team

- In 2024, we attended 16 [quiz nights](/tags/quiznight/), down from 18 last year. The highlight was probably winning the [Geekfight League Final](/2024/01/geekfight-league-final/) at the start of the year!
- Win rate: 8 wins, a solid 50% win rate, compared to 33% the previous year.
- By host:
    - Popquiz: 6
    - Jason @ Don Conejos: 4
    - TriviaDown: 2
    - Geekfight: 2
    - Cinema 76: 1
    - SmartyPants: 1
- NYT crosswords: Unfortunately, I broke the NYT crossword streak TWICE this year. The longest streak record stands at 1014, almost THREE YEARS!! It will take a while to build that back up again.
- The Trivia Team has a YT channel, [@teamcamoteph](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph) where we upload recordings of the above shenanigans and other gaming and puzzle things. We uploaded 54 videos in 2024, up from 38 videos in 2023. Most of that were recordings of us playing Cine2Nerdle!

#### Food

- New section because I added [a food stats page](/page/stats/food/) this year!
- Donuts eaten: 9 donuts, up from 7 last year!
- Top fast food restaurants this year, by spend:
    - Pizza Hut (39 meals, P4,919.60)
    - Jollibee (20 meals, P3,414.00)
    - Shakey's (5 meals, P2,725.00): I think we were just trying to maximize our Supercard lol

#### Others

- Steps/Activity:
    - ##: TODO
    - Fitbit: 2,158,167 steps, 1,683.32km, up almost 12% from last year, which is amazing considering [I stopped using my Fitbit in August](/2023/09/moving-on-fitbit/)!
    - Google Fit: 1,023,998 steps since mid-August. I switched to this app to track my steps after giving up on Fitbit.
    - Year total: 3,182,165 steps, or an average of 8.7k steps daily
        - Again an amazing total, considering last year's Fitbit total was already my record for most number of steps logged in a year. I started the year averaging 7.5k steps per day in January and was averaging 10k steps per day by May. I mostly held that up for the rest of the year except for a few weeks of unavoidable interruptions. (Hospital stay, covid bout, holiday rest.) 
        - Happily, I also saw my weight drop a bit this year, although I don't check it regularly, and I suspect I regained some of it again over the holidays.
- Baptisms attended: 0, from 0 last year
- Weddings attended: 0, from 0 last year
- Wakes attended: 1; this was a friend's mom.
- New pamangkins: 0
- Grab:
    - Trips: 44 (!!) way up from 18 last year. This was mostly because of medical errands where I had to accompany one or both of the parents to some appointment, so regular taxis weren't an option.
    - Food delivery: 4, up from 1 last year. This was mostly because I got free discount codes from Globe rewards I think.
    - Express delivery: 3, from 1 last year. Again, this was just to send out stuff to some family members.
- Bears defeated in single combat: 0
- Tips received via [my profile on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/roytang): None this year. 

### The future

One last statistic: this year's yearnotes is about 30% longer than last year's. 

For me, the year in review post is about the past year. My next post will be my 2024 checklist, where I talk about the future and things I'm looking forward to in the coming year.
