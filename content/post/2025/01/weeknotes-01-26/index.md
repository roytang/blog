title: Weeknotes 2025-01-19 The Years Are Short But The Days Are Long
toc: true
---

This past week as I was browsing through some old files to do cleanup stuff I think my brain finally caught up to the fact that we are currently in the year of our lord 2025. That means 2015 was a whole decade ago, and a whole quarter century has passed since the year 2000. The years go by so quickly, yet a lot of the days recently feel like a struggle to get through.

### My Week

It has been a bit easier this past week with Patient#3 finally at home. We have more people to share the burden of care and we are learning to manage the oxygen support requirements. But her condition is not improving as much as I had hoped it would and we have chemo sessions this week so I am a bit stressed out about how much trouble we will have getting her to the hospital. Still no choice but to take it one day at a time.

Given that, I did have much more free time this past week of course, and have started getting back into my routines such as they were. This includes the aforementioned digging through old files in the name of digital decluttering, moving along some projects that have stalled, the tiniest amount of progress on my year goals and I even got to wander the mall a bit.

I was able to write some non-weeknotes blog posts again! There's [the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review](/2025/01/indiana-jones-great-circle/), [a reminder to self about dealing with stress/anxiety](/2025/01/the-best-you-can/), and [a bunch of tech/social media-related links](/2025/01/tech-linkdump/).

### Media Diet

**Reading**: Mostly just comics recently, my non-comic book reading has stalled. I am adding a bunch of books to my lists for checking out, given how I have been catching up on everyone's end-of-2024 posts, but who knows when/if I manage to get around to reading any of those?

**Watching**: I think the only ongoings I am following regularly right now are **Dragon Ball Daima** and **Sakamoto Days**, both via Netflix. I did manage to watch a few movies this week though; the last one before this week was back in October! All reviews are on Letterboxd:

- [Easy A (2010)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/easy-a/)
- [Twisters (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/twisters/)
- [Wind River (2017)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/wind-river-2017/)
- [The Beekeeper (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-beekeeper-2024/)

**Gaming**: Having finished Indiana Jones already, I have not yet kicked off any new single-player games yet. Mostly just trying to keep up with **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game**. (I did manage to sneak a little bit of **Street Fighter 6** in yesterday though.)

### Walking and Health

Now that I'm back home full-time, I am starting to ramp up my walking again, but we aren't there yet. I walked 52,924 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), with only yesterday (Saturday) hitting 10k. 

Also, since the recent hospital stay I have lightened up a bit. I was already losing a bit in the second half of the year, but I weighed myself this morning and I think that's the lightest I have been in 10 years! I am not yet sharing the number lol.

### Links to Share

Nothing new on the [linkblog](/links) yet. I will probably do a few more [linkdump posts](/blog/tags/links/) first to clear out the backlogs.

### Looking Forward

There's a bunch of stuff I'm excited for in the coming weeks, many of them around mid-February namely:

- Invincible S3 (Feb06)
- new Magic set (Feb11)
- new Civilization game!! (Feb12)
- new Captain America film (Feb12)
- Avowed! (Feb18)

Aside from that, February is typically a busy month as we have multiple birthdays across the extended fam, so I expect we will be getting together a couple of times at least.

I am hoping the situation with Patient #3 improves soon so I can enjoy all these things a bit more.
