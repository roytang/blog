### The World

- The No Kings protests are happening in the US this weekend. Looks like there was a good turnout and a lot of people had fun protesting ThatGuy.
- Speaking of ThatGuy, miraculously the Gaza peace plan has pushed through. Hostages have been released and prisoners exchanged and so on. Still some violence - Hamas immediately went ahead and executed some people on their side to assert control and there's some stuff on the Israel side too - but that is at least a slight improvement over the wanton genocide happening before. The world waits to see if the ceasefire will hold and things actually get better.
- Over here in the PH: same old really. Still yet to hold anyone accountable for all that corruption coming to light.

### My Week

- It was kind of a busy week, with a scary incident or two.
- Our family had a health scare last weekend. Someone I grew up with, younger than me, had a cardiac incident and had to have angioplasty. It was very fortunate that it wasn't some sudden event and they detected it as it happened. We are very thankful he pulled through and is already at home recovering.
- We went to visit him in the hospital right after the procedure. I was kind of amazed at how it was done; for some reason I thought putting a stent in would involve cutting open the chest and a lot of recovery, but it wasn't actually very invasive! They went in through the wrist and applied the stent remotely! Very modern I suppose. 
- During the hospital visit and the a recent get-together and in our group chats, a lot of the discussions centered around health concerns and how we can avoid future problems. The person involved was arguably the healthiest among us; he regularly played basketball and went to the gym. Just goes to show how such problems can strike out of nowhere.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to keep up with newer releases. New post is in progress!
- Books: No new books started yet. I have a couple I plan to read that have been sitting on my desk for about a week now.

#### Watching

- Binged: **Eyes of Wakanda**. Getting started on my backlog of Marvel/Star Wars stuff I want to watch.
- Started: **Ranma 1/2 S2**
- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **Only Murders In The Building S5**, **High Potential S2**.
- Movies: [Karate Kid (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/karate-kid-legends/) dropped on NF this past week so I watched that.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: I have stopped playing this week, planning to quit entirely. Will probably write a blog post about it at some point.
    - **Magic Arena**: Mostly just playing regular Standard and waiting for Omenpaths quick drafts to come back.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Now that Snap is out, I needed another regular game that I can actually play on my phone when I'm in a queue or whatever. Eternal feels like it is already dying, but there's still a bunch of stuff I want to accomplish in this game.
- Single-player games: 
    - Finished: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**!! Absolutely brutal. Hope to write the review this week.
    - Started: 
        - **Metaphor: ReFantazio**. This one was on Game Pass and was very well-reviewed. I already missed out on *Persona 3 Reload* when it left Game Pass, so I want to get this done, especially if the recent price increases make me quit the service!
        - **BALLxPIT**: However, I got distracted by this new indie roguelite that dropped this week! Most of my gaming hours this week went to this. Hopefully I can unlock everything quickly so I can move on!
- Boardgames / Other: 
    - My regular gaming group played *Ethnos* last weekend, hope to write a review soon.
    - Last night, some friends and I tried out the demo for the upcoming coop beat-em-up *Marvel Cosmic Invasion*. Very fun, and of course I love the Marvel flavor as always. IDK if I'd spend money on this genre though.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 61,306 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), much more than last week. I've lowered my standards the last few months or so, being happy with just hitting 50k steps per week. But after the recent health discussions I kind of want to reverse that a bit and maybe try pushing to at least 60k again. It looks like we are in for a rainy week though, so IDK if I can keep it up.

### Links to Share

In mid-2022 I started running this section in my weeknotes, basically listing out all of the week's posts on the [linkblog](/links/). I've decided to stop doing that, at least for a while. This is mostly to keep the blog and the linkblog running independently. Recently it felt like I've been forcing myself to share some links every Sunday so I'd have some stuff in this section for the weeknotes. I need the linkblog to find its own cadence! Although this may backfire and make my feed reader backlog even worse? We'll see how it goes.

This section was also a violation of [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself). Honestly I was probably also partially doing it to kind of pad the word count on less active weeks and that's not the kind of thing I want to encourage. Blog posts can be any length you want!

I do know at least one of my friends reads the blog and not the link blog; you know who you are: if you want to see the links, go follow the linkblog!

### Looking Forward

As always, still so much stuff I want to do and read and watch and play. Also some more family events coming up next weekend. I suspect next week's weeknotes will be a bit delayed.
