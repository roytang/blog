It has been more than 6 years since I played through [Hollow Knight](/2019/02/hollow-knight/)! Around that time the sequel *Silksong* had just been announced, so it took over half a decade for them to get it done! I wasn't initially planning to play this immediately, but it was out on PC Game Pass so I jumped at the chance. 

This post will try to avoid spoilers.

The protagonist in Silksong is *Hornet*, who was the protagonist's ally in *Hollow Knight*. Silksong sees Hornet in the land of Pharloom, trying to find the entity that brought her here against her will. 

If you played Hollow Knight, I can say that Silksong is more of the same; much more in fact. The aesthetic is the same though some areas are more steampunk. The map feels a lot bigger with so much to find an explore and discover.

Hornet is a much more versatile and deadlier protagonist than the Knight; she has more weapons at her disposal, more movement options, and configurable setups. To balance that out, Silksong is a much more challenging game than Hollow Knight; it is absolutely brutal. Even normal enemies can challenge you, and bosses will have you retrying many times. Many challenging fights will have you tracking multiple different things at once to avoid and take out. Exploration is often hindered by challenging arena gauntlets, sometimes in succession! Save points (benches) are few and far between and you will breath a sigh of relief when you find one. Except sometimes they can attack you!! And when you (inevitably) die, the runbacks are often long and super annoying. 

Even the platforming sections are very challenging. There is no one area that are maybe as hard and expansive as Hollow Knight's *Path of Pain* (which I never finished), but there's like many smaller versions of that one, and one endgame section in particular had my hands hurting after I managed to get through it after many many tries. I am a bit proud that I got through all the difficult platforming in this one!

I am still admittedly very bad at action games. My reaction time isn't the best and my inputs aren't precise. So Silksong was very very challenging for me, especially early on when you don't have so many abilities available. I'm pretty sure more than one boss took me around 50 tries or so, each time with annoying runbacks. Later on in the game even when you have your full arsenal available, the bosses are still very hard. At some point you run out of upgrades to find and the only thing you can get is good. And that took me a while!

This is most evident in my playtime. I hit 100% completion in Hollow Knight in under 40 hours. For Silksong, it took me ALMOST NINETY HOURS:

I kind wish the game tracked how many times I died, I think the number would be insane.

That is in-game completion. For achievement completion, I'm not going for it for the same reasons as Hollow Knight: it is all a bit much for me. There are achievements for speedrunning the game and for finishing without dying. It's entirely possible I get good enough at the game eventually to do these things, but I fear that will take much much more than the 90h I've already invested!

I did get most of the achievements done, so that's something:

I recorded myself fighting some of the late game bosses (each one took many recorded attempts) and they are in [this Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXhz9qXkpJznQ58wRo7WHxS-) if you like that sort of thing. Embedding the first video below.

Overall very happy with the game despite how hard it was for me. It's the kind of game that although it's challenging, it never feels too unfair; when you die (and I died a lot), you can always see what you could have done better. And IDK if it's because I spent so much time with Silksong, but it feels like this game will stay in my head more. I can barely remember the events of Hollow Knight! But here the NPCs and the boss fights all feel more memorable. 

I am looking forward to playing the eventual sequel in like ten years, hopefully I still have some measure of action game reflexes by then!
