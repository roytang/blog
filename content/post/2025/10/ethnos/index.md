Before our American friend flew back to the US, we played one last boardgame over at his place: Ethnos. In this game you try to assemble "tricks" in your hand (not unlike say Gin Rummy or Mah Jong) and play them for various effects to earn points. Cards are grouped into "tribes" [^1] of anthromorphic animals and a "trick" can be a group of cards all with the same color, or all with the same tribe. When you play a trick, you choose a "leader" card, and that card's tribe determines what effect the trick has. There are more tribes available than players, and not all of them are included with each game, making each run feel a bit unique. Tribe effects include simple ones like drawing extra cards, but some tribes also introduce their own tracks (small separate boards) that have their own points-earning mechanisms. Players have to balance all of these out while trying to take control of territories to earn points as well. 

There is a lot of randomness, and some tension once the draw deck is down to its second half, because there are three "DRAGON" cards shuffled in the lower half, and once the third one is drawn the age ends and scoring is done. So you have to decide whether you want to draw more cards and risk a dragon or just be satisfied with what you have in case the game ends early.

The artwork on the cards is pretty good and colorful, though the anthromorphic Koi tribe left me super puzzled as to how their bodies work. Apparently we were playing the 2nd edition, as the first edition had a much more "generic fantasy art" feel.

It was a reasonably fun game, and we managed to play two runs, though I am annoyed that I did not win either; I finished second to last in the first run and in second place for the second one (when I had a better idea what I was doing). I think each run took under an hour and there was minimal setup, so not a bad way to spend some time with friends.

[^1]: the title of the game itself feels already vaguely racist, so it was a good choice not to go with the word "race"
