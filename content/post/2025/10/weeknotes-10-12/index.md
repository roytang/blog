### The World

It looks like Trump's Gaza Peace Plan might actually work! Sadly for him, this was not enough for him to win the Nobel Peace Prize, which was awarded to Maria Corina Mechado of the Venezuelan opposition to the Maduro dictatorship.

Not all of Trump's diplomatic efforts are going well. This week, China announced export controls on rare earth minerals to the US, prompting Trump to threaten to increase China tariffs again to the previous level of 130% starting next month. The stock markets are shook.

Here on our side, corruption scandal investigations are still ongoing. And we had like 3 earthquakes over the past couple of weeks for some reason, mostly in Visayas and Mindanao.

### My Week

- Kind of busy, especially this weekend. I attended a party at a friend's house even. Socializing!
- Fam get-together this weekend to celebrate the second-youngest niece's birthday. Was short and quick, because everybody is busy apparently.
- We received some worrying health news about an extended family member last Saturday. More tests are to be done and we are hoping for the best. We are planning to go to the hospital this week to visit. This has led to more health-related discussions among our get-togethers and group chats.
- On the blog: A [review for Pandemic Legacy](/2025/10/pandemic-legacy/).
- Our *balikbayan* friend is flying back to the US and I am looking forward to much less in-person meetups again. I enjoy hanging out with my gaming group, but I still very much have an introvert limit apparently.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to keep up with newer releases, and a new post is still pending.
- Books: No new books started yet.

#### Watching

- Finished: **Peacemaker S2**
- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **Only Murders In The Building S5**, **High Potential S2**.
- Movies: Finally watched a new movie again! It was [Sinners (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/sinners-2025/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: The new season is kind of boring. Still chugging along.
    - **Magic Arena**: 
        - Doing terribly with Omenpaths drafting. Honestly I am looking forward to the next set already.
        - TMNT set scheduled for next year (after Lorwyn Eclipsed) was announced at NYCC. I am not enthused.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**. I am close to finishing a 100% completion run; I think all side quests are already done and I just have a couple of missing things to find. 
- Boardgames / Other: My regular gaming group played *Pandemic Legacy*! I wrote a review and it is linked above. We also finished *Sunderfolk*, but I have yet to write a review.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 52,686 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). This is a bit less than last week. Thankfully my coughs and colds have vanished again.

### Links to Share

Starting to work my way through my backlog of saved links:

- [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail)

    > "This means it’s really easy to get stuck. Stuck in your current way of seeing and thinking about things. Frames are made out of the details that seem important to you. The important details you haven’t noticed are invisible to you, and the details you have noticed seem completely obvious and you see right through them. This all makes makes it difficult to imagine how you could be missing something important."

    > "If you’re trying to do impossible things, this effect should chill you to your bones. It means you could be intellectually stuck right at this very moment, with the evidence right in front of your face and you just can’t see it."

    > "If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived."

- [Frank Chimero · Selling Lemons](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2025/selling-lemons/)

    Frank Chimero considers the "market of lemons" concept as applied to the internet:

    > "Akerlof asks us to imagine ourselves buying a used car. Some cars on the lot are reliable, well-maintained gems. Others cars are lemons, the kinds of cars that can make it off the lot but are disasters waiting to happen. The sellers know which cars are which, but you, as a buyer, can’t tell the difference. That information asymmetry affects the average price in the market and eventually impacts the overall market dynamics."

- [/u/NowGoodbyeForever on Empathy (from Reddit thread on conservatives and empathy)](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1nudb7j/comment/nh0bwt3/)

    > "Empathy is a slippery slope towards understanding situations and working to change them. "

    > "Empathy is the antidote to this shit, because it's an emotional response that's based in reality and truth. Because the truth of the matter is that all of these scary Other Groups are just people. People who have more in common with the average worker than the impossibly wealthy ghouls running the government."

    > "Children are the same everywhere, from Pittsburgh to Palestine. Young people are struggling to find stability and work, whether they're straight or gay, cis or trans. Immigrants don't want to steal your jobs; they want to work for a better life, same as you."

- [Have I Earned It?](https://kottke.org/25/10/have-i-earned-it)

    Kottke quoting Craig Mod:

    > "He wonders, always wonders, if he has earned it. The time alone, the steps, the little interactions, the looking closely at the world. He takes it, he’ll take whatever he can get whenever, and try to be as grateful as possible. What else is there? Tiny men with big sticks upend sanity the world ‘round and all you can do is try to find your footing and push back."

    Trent Siegfried in the comments:

    > "My personal philosophy is that none of us have earned it, and that a moment of peace when you're on a beautiful walk, or looking at a flower, or playing with a child is a genuine gift from the universe, with no need to repay it. I haven't earned that gift, it is given to me freely."

- [Links make the web great](https://joelchrono.xyz/blog/links-make-the-web-great)

    > "I am actually kinda terrible at talking about things, I’m decent in some scenarios or with previous preparation, like presentations where I can write down my thoughts beforehand, but I still struggle otherwise.

    >

    > In the web, I don’t worry much about it, just express what I want, and link to other pages explaining missing context, if I deem it necessary.

    >

    > And to me, that’s great, because it lets me discover the web the way it was intended to be."

My feed reader backlog remains huge, but I am slowly starting to whittle away at it.

### Looking Forward

Hopefully a more chill week, as I've fallen behind in things I want to get done.
