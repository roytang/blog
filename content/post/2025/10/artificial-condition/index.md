title: Artificial Condition by Martha Wells (Murderbot Diaries book 2)
---

★★★★

A friend recently bought the complete set of the *Murderbot Diaries* books and I was able to convince her to lend me book 2 since I read book 1 last month and they are short and super quick to read. I finished this one in 2 days.

The highlight of this book was Murderbot meeting ART, a second AI, one that is able to figure him out and talks back to him. They have great interaction, Murderbot hates it (at least at first). He also meets a new group of humans that he somehow ends up having to help.

I am looking forward to watching the TV adaptation eventually, so one thing constantly in my mind is how they are going to adapt most of the scenes. A lot of the book takes place in Murderbot's head or in AI-to-AI communications with ART, so it's interesting to see how that plays out.

After the first book I wasn't sure if this was just going to be some kind of anthology series with Murderbot wandering around just helping random humans he runs into, but I'm glad to find out that there is an overarching plot that moves along a little bit in each book.

I have also already been lent/given a copy of the 3rd book, looking forward to that!
