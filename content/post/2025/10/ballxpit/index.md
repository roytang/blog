After finishing [Silksong](/2025/10/silksong/), I wanted to drive straight into a nice good chill RPG, but life had other plans:

*BALL X PIT* dropped on PC Game Pass and I gave it a try and was immediately drawn in by the arcade-like runs where you bounce a bunch of balls around trying to kill a lot of enemies slowly coming down at the screen at you, Breakout-style. As you kill enemies you gain experience and level up and unlock new balls (weapons) and passive abilities. Each ball has different effects, and occasionally you get a fusion reactor which can let you combine balls or evolve two or more balls into a completely new one. The lore behind all of this is utter nonsense so don't worry about it too much.

It was strangely engrossing, at least at first. The easiest comparison is to [Vampire Survivors](/2023/01/vampire-survivors/), which drew me in because it had a lot of unlockables and each run was relatively quick.

BALL X PIT [^1] runs are about half as long as VS runs, so it's even easier to just sit down and play a run or two. In between runs, there is base-building and you can send your characters to harvest resources and build more buildings and such, which they also do by bouncing around the base for some reason.

The unlockables are stages, playable characters, and building blueprints. Some of the characters are interesting, not just variants with different starting weapons or whatever. For example: the Physicist changes the physics of how balls bounce, the Tactician turns each run into a turn-based affair somehow, and the Radical made your runs completely automated - you could send him in and leave him to do the run automatically. Later on you unlocked the ability to send two characters at once, combining their effects, which made some interesting combinations. 

Completion was fairly straightforward. Unlock all the things, complete all the available balls and supports in the in-game encyclopedia, that sort of thing. The most tedious part was having to finish each stage with each character at least once. There are 10 stages and 16 characters. Even with the doubling up of characters, it still got pretty tedious at the end. Especially with the Tactician, the runs take so much longer! Having the Radical made things a bit easier, as I could just leave him running while I went to do other things. I considered not completing all of the characters, but in the end I did it anyway:

Total playtime was under 30h, and I burnt through that quickly so I could move on! HLTB has completionist runs at around 33h average, so that's not too bad.

The runs are pretty fun once you draw the right combination of balls and passives; you can effectively make an engine that just carpets the field with balls to eat through the enemies. That part reminded me a lot of VS. I did do one gameplay recording and uploaded it on Youtube:

It was an entertaining enough game, but ultimately probably not as deep as Vampire Survivors was. I got to a point where I unlocked everything and there was even a new game+ with harder stages supposedly, but IDK what the point of that would be. Maybe I'll try them at some point.

[^1]: I still pronounce the "X" in the name despite officially it shouldn't be. I do the same for "Hunter X Hunter".
