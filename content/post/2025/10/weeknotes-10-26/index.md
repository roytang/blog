These weeknotes are coming in a bit late because I had a long and busy weekend, k? 

### My Week

- Not a lot to write about this past week. Kind of unproductive actually. I did have to house-sit a bunch though.
- This past weekend was busy because we had a fam gathering a ways away from home.
- On the blog: Reviews for [Silksong](/2025/10/silksong/) and the boardgame [Ethnos](/2025/10/ethnos/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to keep up with newer releases. New post is still in progress!
- Books: No new books started yet.

#### Watching

- Binged: **Marvel Zombies**.
- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **Only Murders In The Building S5**, **High Potential S2**, **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: I watched [Black Bag (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/black-bag-2025/) on streaming.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: No longer playing.
    - **Magic Arena**: Mostly just playing regular Standard and waiting for Omenpaths quick drafts to come back. They announced Vintage/Powered Cube coing to Arena this week! I wanna try it out but that's gonna take resources away from my regular Standard set drafting!
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Doing regular grinding, but occasionally also trying to power through the game's still-updating single-player content and doing some of the many many achievements.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: 
        - **BALLxPIT**: Once again, most of my gaming hours this week went to this. I am close to achievement completion on this one though, and my enthusiasm is starting to peter out. So either way I should be done with it soon!
        - **Metaphor: ReFantazio**: Progress has been slow because of the above, but I try to keep it going so that I don't lose too much momentum.
- Boardgames / Other: 
    - I have been kind of thinking about considering getting a Steam Deck maybe.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 67,000 steps (a nice and suspiciously round number) over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), big step up from the last few months! In fact, this is my highest weekly total since early April! Good job me! It helps that the weather wasn't very rainy this past week.

### Site Updates

- 4 new entries on [the link blog](/links/)

### Looking Forward

Ugh, October is almost over. Which means the year is almost over. Aaaaugh!!

That also means next weekend is [*Undas*](https://www.thesummitexpress.com/2024/10/why-all-saints-day-called-undas-philippines.html) over here.

It looks like the trivia team is ending the month without attending any quiz nights. Hopefully we are back soon!
