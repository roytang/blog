title: Pandemic Legacy (Season 1)
---

We've been hanging out with a *balikbayan* friend the last couple of weeks and he brought over his copy of *Pandemic Legacy* that he's had since before COVID, mostly because he wanted to play it and get rid of it already.

If you're not aware, *Pandemic Legacy* is a "legacy" version of the now-classic co-op boardgame *Pandemic*. "Legacy" here apparently means there is an ongoing campaign and you and your team play multiple games of Pandemic, except with each successive game the rules and the board and even your characters can change, for better or usually for worse. Modifications are applied through methods such as stickers [^1] and the box comes with several "secret" compartments that you only open when the campaign conditions dictate, giving you additional rules, actions, and often problems.

We played the game over two-and-a-half days hanging out at a friend's house, each day being maybe 6-8 hours of play. Our score sheet (see attached image) tells us we played 18 games total, losing 7 of them. We at least managed to win and finish the campaign with a total score of 717 points (and were able to prevent Manila [^2] from becoming a fallen city). Also managed to not have any of our characters die due to scars!

Checking some threads over on boardgamegeek, it looks like we scored on the low side (I couldn't help comparing!). We could have finished with an additional 80 pts if the team had destroyed the one enemy structure on the last map like I wanted! (It didn't have any negative effects on us, but I hated it!). We even had some "accidental" cheating a few times because we misunderstood the rules/instructions (okay, and also intentional cheating one time when we mulliganed the starting infected cities).

I have somewhat mixed feelings about the whole "Legacy" concept applied to boardgames; the idea is that the changes to the game are permanent and you only ever play each set once. On the one hand this seems super wasteful but on the other hand I don't see any specific gaming group being willing to play a campaign like this more than once. You could in theory put all the stickers and other stuff back in their original compartments to try to get some replay value, but that seems finicky and not worth it maybe? The owner of the set was just happy to be done with the game and is not planning to bring it back with him; we ended up leaving it at our friend's house where we met up. In theory you could still play normal Pandemic with the set, ignoring the changes applied using stickers. I thought about taking the set home with me myself, but that just feels like more house clutter I have to think about getting rid of at some point in the future.

The owner also has *Pandemic Legacy (Season 2)* back home in the US; it is a sequel to this campaign. There is a good chance we play it when he comes over next year!
