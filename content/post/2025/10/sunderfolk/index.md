*Sunderfolk* ([available on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2414270/Sunderfolk/)) is a boardgame-like turn-based tactical coop game that came out earlier this year. It has a unique hook where characters are controlled via a mobile app instead of through the game itself. That means for a group playing coop, only one person needs to have a copy of the game!

Unfortunately, this did not work too well in practice. The main problem is that the mobile interface can be clunky. While the Steam game shows the main battle map, each player must move and attack via touch-dragging on the mobile app which reflects as the cursor moving on the Steam game. The problem is there is a slight lag when doing so, which can easily lead to mistakes. This was exacerbated for our group because the one who bought the game was in the US and we were joining via a Discord stream, so the increased lag often made the mobile interactions miserable. After some time, we had taken to calling the game "Bad Phone Interface" as a nickname! 

These problems eased a bit when the owner came home to the PH for a couple of weeks, and we were able to finish the campaign last week.

To be fair, other than the control scheme, the campaign was pretty good. There were some interesting missions and character abilities and gameplay gimmicks. (Except for one mission near the end which we hated and for some reason gave us a loss when we thought we had won.) There is a town which you visit in-between missions where you can buy stuff and do Persona-like "social link" conversations to improve relationships. The story was about anthromorphized animals facing a mysterious power that was threatening their way of life. Nothing exceptional, but completely serviceable. Also, at certain points they let you change the names of some characters and items, which was fun. There was one NPC we named "Shroomimasen" and we loved it whenever he was around!

Apparently [the game flopped though](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-22/blizzard-co-founder-s-game-startup-struggles-amid-industry-glut):

This is unsurprising. While the mobile-only control scheme was a bold attempt at innovation, it didn't really work out. The game might have sold a lot better if it just supported traditional online multiplayer and not required a second device to play. In fact I suspect that the mobile interface they worked with might have turned out more expensive from an engineering perspective. 

Oh well, at least we finished the game! Since I never bought the game on Steam myself and only played through my friend's campaign, I don't have any screenshots for this one.
