### Previously

This is the part 19 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run). 

This post is all about Thor and Thor-adjacent stories. Previously I already covered [Thor v1](/2023/05/marvel-run-4-thor-etc/) and [Jason Aaron's Thor runs](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/). Those actually already cover majority of the mainline Thor stories in Marvel! This post will try to cover the remainder of them. I'll also cover two big crossover events that are Thor-adjacent: *Siege* and *Fear Itself*.

As always, my preferred reference for Marvel's sometimes confusing volume numbering is [the list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(B%E2%80%93C)#T).

### Heroes Reborn

#### Journey Into Mystery v3 (1996)

20 issues: #503-521, -1

During the 1996 *Heroes Reborn* event, *Thor* was the only cancelled book that did not immediately receive a new volume and a new #1 set in the pocket universe. Instead, we got the 3rd volume of *Journey Into Mystery*, continuing the numbering from *Thor v1*, since that book originally followed the numbering from *Journey Into Mystery v1*. (This would turn out very confusing down the line for Thor's own modern legacy numbering, but that's Marvel for you.)

Instead of covering Thor in the pocket universe, the new volume was a 616 story about the Lost Gods of Asgard. Basically, Odin hatched some scheme to avoid Ragnarok by pretending all the Asgardians were dead. Instead they were all shuffled into mortal lives, losing all memory of Asgard. The Lost Gods storyline follows erstwhile Thor-replacement Red Norvell as he seeks out the Lost Gods and tries to restore their memories. The antagonist of this story is Seth, the Egyptian god of Death.

The last 8 issues of the volume consisted of multi-part stories featuring Shang-Chi, Black Widow and Hannibal King.

I was kind of disappointed that I had to start this batch of reads with this book, as usually the Asgard crew aren't all that interesting without Thor, but surprisingly I found the Lost Gods storyline to be an entertaining enough read. The later non-Asgard issues were very forgettable though.

### Post Heroes Reborn

#### Thor v2 (1998)

85 issues.

This volume is mostly by Dan Jurgens. It's not a very well-known run, though it did introduce some interesting concepts. It introduced Tarene / "Thor Girl", who supposedly had a destiny to "evolve sentient beings to the next level" as the Designate, but AFAIK this was a plot thread that was never followed through and she has stayed a minor character after this run. (Perhaps something some future writer can pick up on at some point?)

A notable plot line in this volume is the Death of Odin and Thor taking over as King of Asgard, something I was surprised had been done before he became All-Father in more recent volumes. Thor's reign did not go too well however. During this time, Odin had split Thor's mortal and Asgardian halves (the human half was "Jake Olson") and the Asgardian half eventually succumbed to his own hubris and ended taking over the Earth, ostensibly for humanity's own good. For a while, the book carried the subtitle "Lord of Earth"! This brought Thor into conflict with the other heroes and so on. The book carries on far into the future, showing the resistance to Thor's rule and the future of Thor-run Earth, before time-travel shenanigans eventually restore the original timeline.

Of note: Magni, son of Thor and Enchantress is introduced in this alternate future and was recently brought back into the 616 during the recently concluded *Immortal Thor* (see below).

I like this run; the execution could have better, but it was a great what if.

Dan Jurgens' run ended with #79. The last 6 issues of this book sees Thor facing the spectre of Ragnarok and figuring out how to break the cycle. This leads into *Avengers Disassembled* and Thor would wait two and a half years before he gets another book!

#### Thor v3 (2007)

35 issues: #1-12, #600-621, Giant-Size Finale

The first half of this volume (up to #603) was by Straczynski. It features Thor coming back from the nothingness he was in after he ended the Ragnarok cycle in the previous book. Notably, Thor chose to rebuild Asgard in Broxton, Oklahoma, the start of a long period with which the town would be associated with Asgard. Thor also spent some time bringing back all the Asgardians who had become trapped in mortal lives (shades of the Lost Gods storyline from JiM v3!).

The events in this book happen post-Civil War, and in one of the early issues Thor has words with Tony Stark over the fact that Tony created a clone of him during that crossover. He was super mad, but AFAIK that wasn't really followed up on and after some time they were buddies again.

Loki is the main antagonist of this run, revealing Baldur was one of Odin's sons and turning him against Thor so that Baldur becomes ruler of Asgard. Doom also plays as a small part. Notable character introduced here is Bill, a normal man from Broxton who falls in love with the Asgardian Kelda and eventually dies a warrior's death and goes to Valhalla.

I read this run back in the day and my favorite thing about it is that this was my first introduction to one of my current favorite Marvel artists: Olivier Coipel! His line work is just fantastic, which made these issues a joy to re-read. Still no idea how to pronounce his name though.

#### Captain America and ... (2011)

22 issues: 

- Captain America and Bucky #620-628
- Captain America and Hawkeye #629-632
- Captain America and Iron Man #633-635
- Captain America and Namor #635.1
- Captain America and Black Widow #636-640

It infuriates me to no end that this set of team-up books continues the numbering from v6, yet v7 is the one to follow the legacy numbering. I think Brubaker was involved in the first few arcs (the Bucky ones?) Starting from "... and Hawkeye", Cullen Bunn took over writing duties and there is an overarching storyline about a multiversal villain named Kashmir Vennema who formed a corporation with her multiversal variants.

#### Captain America v7 (2011)

19 issues.

As mentioned above, the legacy numbering continues with this reboot volume, still by Brubaker and with Steve serving as Captain America once again. This volume is still okay, though the previous one is much better. I do like that Brubaker brought back Diamondback (Rachel Leighton), who is one of my favorite Captain America supporting characters (too bad she was cut out of [Brave New World](/2025/04/movies-tv-1q/#captain-america-brave-new-world-2025)!)

### The Spencer Era

Alright, now we skip ahead a couple of years to Nick Spencer's era. The intervening years were covered by [my review of Rick Remender's run](/2023/01/marvel-run-3-captain-america-etc/#captain-america-v8-2013-2014) in a previous post. That volume ends with Captain America being re-aged and losing his Super Soldier Serum powers and deciding to turn the mantle of Captain America over to Sam Wilson.

Overall, Spencer's era was okay, though not as good as Brubaker's I think. The highlight of this era was the introduction of an evil, Hydra-aligned version of Captain America/Steve Rogers in Secret Empire.

#### Captain America: Sam Wilson (2015)

24 issues

{{< photos 1586 >}}

This is Sam's first volume as Captain America! And to say he faces a lot of challenges as a black man taking over the role is an understatement - a good part of the volume has the Red Skull (of course he is back!) stirring up public sentiment against Sam in the new role. A lot of racism and immigration issues are involved of course. This volume has the first appearance of Joaquin Torres as the Falcon, who is the victim of genetic manipulation by Karl Malus. Things come to a head after Steve Rogers is repowered (see Avengers Standoff below), and there is a public outcry that Sam "give back the shield". The volume ends with tie-ins to the Secret Empire event (see below).

#### Avengers Standoff (2016)

Three one-shots that aren't part of other series:

- Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill #1
- Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1
- Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega #1

This crossover centered around Pleasant Hill, seemingly a small idyllic town in rural America, but in reality a prison for super criminals run by SHIELD. Maria Hill has used a living cosmic cube named Kobik to trap the supervillains in mundane lifestyles with no memory of their past selves. All hell breaks loose when Helmut Zemo and some other prisoners manage to regain their memory and take the town hostage. This is a relatively small crossover event that ties-in to the Avengers and Captain America: Sam Wilson books.

The most important consequence in this crossover is that Kobik restores Steve Rogers to his prime age, but also secretly rewrites his history because she was manipulated by the Red Skull (see below).

#### Captain America: Steve Rogers (2016)

19 issues

{{< photos 1587 >}}

The first issue of this new volume ends with the shocking reveal that Steve Rogers is Hydra! Serving once again as Captain America in parallel to Steve Rogers (albeit using a different non-round shield), this Steve Rogers is revealed to have been raised as a Hydra agent from a young age and sent in to become Captain America as a sleeper agent. In his "timeline" (created by Kobik), the Nazis and Hydra were about to win the war when the allies rewrote reality with a cosmic cube, allegedly resulting in the 616. Now convinced he has to bring back that "superior" Hydra reality, he first works to overthrow his handler The Red Skull, before setting into motion the events of Secret Empire.

#### Captain America v9 (2017)

1 issue. Officially this is Captain America #25, continuing the numbering from Sam's series above.

#### Secret Empire (2017)

Main title: 10 issues
Side titles:

- Secret Empire: Brave New World #1–5
- Secret Empire: Underground #1
- Secret Empire: United #1
- Secret Empire: Uprising #1
- Secret Empire Omega

I did read the main title for this event back in the day, probably not the side titles though. I did remember enjoying it, but I feel like I appreciate it all the more right now having read the build-up in the 2 Captain America series prior to the event. The entire plan of stranding the heavy hitters outside the planetary shield and the street-level heroes in New York under a darkforce dome while Hydra Cap takes over everywhere else was pretty good. If you wanna read the side stories, I guess Brave New World is the most important one.

At the end of the event, the original Steve Rogers is brought back from Kobik's memories and he takes down Hydra Cap in a televised battle, but his reputation remains tarnished. Hydra Cap sticks around in the 616 to wreak havoc again later!

### Post Secret Empire

#### Captain America v10 (2017)

10 issues: #695-704

This short run by Mark Waid consisted of 3 short story arcs. The run was okay, starting off with Cap facing off against white supremacists, then time travel shenanigans. My favorite is the last story arc which follows the adventures of one of Steve Rogers' descendants who faces a corrupt government and the return of the Red Skull (same old same old!)

#### Captain America v11 (2018)

+5 issues.

Already covered in [the previous post](/2023/01/marvel-run-3-captain-america-etc/#captain-america-v11-2018-2021), BUT I found out the issue count there is wrong. The run is 30 issues instead of 25 mentioned in the previous post. So I am adding +5 issues here just to correct my count.

#### Captain America v12 (2022)

1 issue: #0

This was a one-shot where Steve and Sam team-up to stop one of Armin Zola's mad schemes. At the end of it, they agree that they can both be Captain America. (I am not sure where the second shield comes from!). This issue kicks off two parallel series, one each for Sam and Steve.

#### Captain America: Symbol of Truth (2022)

14 issues

Symbol of Truth is written by Tochi Onyebuch and focuses on Sam as Captain America. His primary antagonist is The White Wolf, adopted brother of Black Panther. Supporting characters include Misty Knight, Joaquin Torres, and Ian Rogers (Nomad).

This series and Sentinel of Liberty below conclude with the Cold War crossover in issues #12 and #13, but Sam gets an extra #14 issue to wrap things up.

Presumably Sam is the "primary" Captain America, so this series gets the legacy numbering instead of the other one. #14 is LGY#749

#### Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty v2 (2022)

13 issues

This is the second Sentinel of Liberty volume; the first one was post-Heroes Reborn by Mark Waid and I will cover that some other time (too many titles in this post already!) This one is written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing.

In this volume, Steve and supporting characters Sharon Carter and Bucky Barnes investigate a shadowy cabal called The Outer Circle that have been manipulating world events throughout history. Heading into the Cold War crossover, Bucky has taken on the mantle of The Revolution, one of the Outer Circle's agents, and plans to dismantle them from the inside.

#### One-Shots

- Captain America Cold War Alpha
- Captain America Cold War omega
- Captain America Finale

The Cold War crossover sees Steve and Sam team-up to fight the apparent collaboration between White Wolf and Bucky Barnes as The Revolution. Bucky installs White Wolf as ruler of Dimension Z and kidnaps Ian Rogers to bring him there, luring the Captains America to a final showdown. In the end, it was revealed that Bucky had an overly complicated plot to defeat the Outer Circle and install Ian as the ruler of Dimension Z, relying on Steve and Sam to defeat White Wolf's army. At the end of it, Sharon takes on the mantle of The Destroyer in memory of their former ally Roger Aubrey.

*Finale* wraps up the Outer Circle loose ends and concludes the Century Game (kind of serving as an epilogue to *Sentinel of Liberty*, Kelly and Lanzing's equivalent to *Symbol of Truth's* #14)

#### Captain America v13 (2023)

1 issue: #750

This a one-shot anthology issue wrapping up the 2 parallel Captain America series and the Cold War event. (Takes place before Captain America Finale)

#### Captain America v14 (2023)

16 issues

A short volume by Straczynski focused on Steve Rogers, mostly dealing with supernatural stuff. Honestly kind of forgettable. Ends with a team-up with Spider-Man and Thor to restore the city of Broxton. Ends with LGY#766

### Wrapping Up

Whew, what a long post. Writing these is always exhausting! Captain America faces much more supernatural/cosmic cube shenanigans than I would have expected before reading all his books!

With that, we are caught up with the main Captain America books! By "main", I mean this should cover all the series that are included as part of Captain America's legacy numbering, and their associated side series and events. Beyond this point there is a new Sam Wilson ongoing (he still gets to continue the legacy numbering) and a new Steve Rogers series launching later this year. There are of course numerous standalone limited series and one shots starring Captain America that I have yet to cover and will need to figure out someday, but for now we can leave Cap alone for a while!

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 335. 

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 26 (!)

Total issues covered so far: 5,550 + 335 = 5,885

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 35,671 (+166 since the previous post)

Progress: 16.5% (15.63% last post). A decent jump.

### Up Next

Not sure yet what I am covering next, I am currently still catching up with ongoing series. Some options: 

- If we follow MCU movie order, we can continue reading Thor next; I've already covered a good chunk of modern era Thor in [the Jason Aaron post](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/) so there's a good chance we can cover most of the main Thor books in the next post. The high fantasy of Asgard would also be a good contrast/palette cleanser after the more grounded Cap stuff.
- I'm also kind of tempted to do a Punisher read, since he's the Marvel Netflix TV guy I haven't covered yet. He's another "grounded" hero, but kind of opposite to Cap ideologically.
- Something else?!?
