### Previously

This is the part 19 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run). 

This post is all about Thor and Thor-adjacent stories. Previously I already covered [Thor v1](/2023/05/marvel-run-4-thor-etc/) and [Jason Aaron's Thor runs](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/). Those actually already cover majority of the mainline Thor stories in Marvel! This post will try to cover the remainder of them. I'll also cover two big crossover events that are Thor-adjacent: *Siege* and *Fear Itself*.

As always, my preferred reference for Marvel's sometimes confusing volume numbering is [the list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(B%E2%80%93C)#T).

### Heroes Reborn

#### Journey Into Mystery v3 (1996)

20 issues: #503-521, -1

During the 1996 *Heroes Reborn* event, *Thor* was the only cancelled book that did not immediately receive a new volume and a new #1 set in the pocket universe. Instead, we got the 3rd volume of *Journey Into Mystery*, continuing the numbering from *Thor v1*, since that book originally followed the numbering from *Journey Into Mystery v1*. (This would turn out very confusing down the line for Thor's own modern legacy numbering, but that's Marvel for you.)

Instead of covering Thor in the pocket universe, the new volume was a 616 story about the Lost Gods of Asgard. Basically, Odin hatched some scheme to avoid Ragnarok by pretending all the Asgardians were dead. Instead they were all shuffled into mortal lives, losing all memory of Asgard. The Lost Gods storyline follows erstwhile Thor-replacement Red Norvell as he seeks out the Lost Gods and tries to restore their memories. The antagonist of this story is Seth, the Egyptian god of Death.

The last 8 issues of the volume consisted of multi-part stories featuring Shang-Chi, Black Widow and Hannibal King.

I was kind of disappointed that I had to start this batch of reads with this book, as usually the Asgard crew aren't all that interesting without Thor, but surprisingly I found the Lost Gods storyline to be an entertaining enough read. The later non-Asgard issues were very forgettable though.

### Post Heroes Reborn

#### Thor v2 (1998)

85 issues.

This volume is mostly by Dan Jurgens. It's not a very well-known run, though it did introduce some interesting concepts. It introduced Tarene / "Thor Girl", who supposedly had a destiny to "evolve sentient beings to the next level" as the Designate, but AFAIK this was a plot thread that was never followed through and she has stayed a minor character after this run. (Perhaps something some future writer can pick up on at some point?)

A notable plot line in this volume is the Death of Odin and Thor taking over as King of Asgard, something I was surprised had been done before he became All-Father in more recent volumes. Thor's reign did not go too well however. During this time, Odin had split Thor's mortal and Asgardian halves (the human half was "Jake Olson") and the Asgardian half eventually succumbed to his own hubris and ended taking over the Earth, ostensibly for humanity's own good. For a while, the book carried the subtitle "Lord of Earth"! This brought Thor into conflict with the other heroes and so on. The book carries on far into the future, showing the resistance to Thor's rule and the future of Thor-run Earth, before time-travel shenanigans eventually restore the original timeline.

Of note: Magni, son of Thor and Enchantress is introduced in this alternate future and was recently brought back into the 616 during the recently concluded *Immortal Thor* (see below).

I like this run; the execution could have better, but it was a great what if.

Dan Jurgens' run ended with #79. The last 6 issues of this book sees Thor facing the spectre of Ragnarok and figuring out how to break the cycle. This leads into *Avengers Disassembled* and Thor would wait two and a half years before he gets another book!

#### Thor v3 (2007)

36 issues: #1-12, #600-621, #620.1, Giant-Size Finale

The first half of this volume (up to #603) was by Straczynski. It features Thor coming back from the nothingness he was in after he ended the Ragnarok cycle in the previous book. Notably, Thor chose to rebuild Asgard in Broxton, Oklahoma, the start of a long period with which the town would be associated with Asgard. Thor also spent some time bringing back all the Asgardians who had become trapped in mortal lives (shades of the Lost Gods storyline from JiM v3!).

The events in this book happen post-Civil War, and in one of the early issues Thor has words with Tony Stark over the fact that Tony created a clone of him during that crossover. He was super mad, but AFAIK that wasn't really followed up on and after some time they were buddies again.

Loki is the main antagonist of this run, revealing Baldur was one of Odin's sons and turning him against Thor so that Baldur becomes ruler of Asgard. Doom also plays as a small part. Notable character introduced here is Bill, a normal man from Broxton who falls in love with the Asgardian Kelda and eventually dies a warrior's death and goes to Valhalla.

I read this run back in the day and my favorite thing about it is that this was my first introduction to one of my current favorite Marvel artists: Olivier Coipel! His line work is just fantastic, which made these issues a joy to re-read. Still no idea how to pronounce his name though.

The "Giant-Size Finale" one-shot was a wrap-up for Straz's run.

#604-614 were written by Kieron Gillen. His issues mostly involve the tie-ins to the *Siege* event and dealing with the aftermath of Straz's run. Notable introduction here would be the much-feared Disir, whom the Asgardians dare not even name, and would be involved in many more plots to come.

#615-621 were written by Matt Fraction, leading up to the eventual relaunch as *The Mighty Thor v1*

### Siege (2010)

The *Siege* event was primarily architected by Brian Michael Bendis and was the culmination of his era-defining Avengers runs starting all the way back from *Avengers Disassembled* and the event ends Norman Osborn's *Dark Reign* era. This event seems Osborn's HAMMER try to take down Asgard in Broxton. The inciting event involved Volstagg manipulated into the same kind of disaster that started *Civil War*.

Main series: 4 issues

The main series is drawn by Olivier Copiel, which I loved.

One-shots and mini-series (total 12 issues):

- Siege: The Cabal (1 issue)
- Origins of Siege (1 issue)
- Siege: Storming Asgard: Heroes & Villains (1 issue): Profiles book
- Siege: Embedded (4 issues): This was a fun one where Ben Urich's Frontline got to travel with and interview Volstagg who was blamed for the Siege.
- Siege: Captain America (1 issue)
- Siege: Spider-Man (1 issue)
- Siege: Loki (1 issue)
- Siege: Young Avengers (1 issue)
- Siege: Secret Warriors (1 issue)

*Siege* ends with Loki despite all his machinations giving up his life to give Thor a chance to defeat The Sentry/The Void, and the destruction of Asgard in Broxton. The victory here also resulted in public opinion coming back to the heroes side and the repeal of the Superhuman Registration Act from *Civil War*, leading in to the *Heroic Age* imprint.

### Post-Siege

#### The Mighty Thor v1 (2011)

This volume ends with the *Everything Burns* crossover with Journey Into Mystery (see below). At the end of it, Odin and Freyja conceived a daughter, Laussa Odinsdotter. She would later become relevant during Aaron's *War of the Realms* and the last arc of Thor v6.

#### Journey Into Mystery v4 (2011)

35 issues: #622-655, 626.1 

*(Still following the Thor numbering, even though it's not officially part of the Thor legacy numbering. It's maddening!)*

Probably my favorite volume of this set. Written by Kieron Gillen up to #645, the series primarily features Kid Loki, trying to do right to escape from his evil past incarnation. The volume starts right in the middle of *Fear Itself* (see below), and follows Loki as he plots and schemes and wheels and deals to help his brother defeat the big bad. After the event, Loki's schemes start to unravel and he has to deal with the consequences.

Notable introductions: 

- Thori, a Hel-hound sired to Garm and the Hel-Wolf.
- Leah, a servant of Hela and eventually Loki's BFF as she helps him with his schemes. Their chemistry and interactions were great.

Gillen's run ends with the *Everything Burns* crossover, and the remaining ten issues of the volume are two Sif-focused story arcs. The story is about Sif becoming a Berserker, but isn't especially memorable. However I remain fond of these stories because this was the first time I encountered another one of my favorite artists: Valerio Schiti.

### Fear Itself (2011)

*Fear Itself* was a crossover event leaning heavily on Captain America and Thor villains. It centers around Sin (the Red Skull's Daughter), releasing the Serpent, an ancient enemy of Odin and the God of Fear. The Serpent summons seven powerful hammers that land on Earth and transform seven characters into the Serpent's Worthy, who proceed to sow chaos and destruction in order to spread fear and increase the Serpent's power. Odin threatens to lay waste to Midgard to defeat the Serpent, and Thor is prophesized to give his life to defeat the Serpent.

Main series: 7 issues

The main series is drawn by Stuart Immonen, another one of my favorite artists.

One-shots and mini-series (total 66 (!!) issues):

This event had a TON of one-shots and miniseries, and I suspect it was the worst event Marvel has ever done in that regard. (More tie-ins means the whole event is harder to follow). That said, most of the minis mostly stand alone, depicting how various characters are dealing with *Fear Itself*.

- Fear Itself: Book of the Skull (1 issue) - prologue book
- Fear Itself: Black Widow (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: Deadpool (3 issues)
- Fear Itself: The Deep (4 issue)
- Fear Itself: FF (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: Fearsome Four (4 issues)
- Fear Itself: Fellowship of Fear (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: The Home Front (7 issues)
- Fear Itself: Hulk Vs. Dracula (3 issues)
- Fear Itself: The Monkey King (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: Sin's Past (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: Spider-Man (3 issues)
- Fear Itself: Spotlight (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: Uncanny X-Force (3 issues)
- Fear Itself: Youth in Revolt (6 issues)
- Fear Itself: The Worthy (1 issue)
- Fear Itself: Wolverine (3 issues)
- Fear Itself #7.1: Captain America (1 issue) - aftermath book
- Fear Itself #7.2: Thor (1 issue) - aftermath book
- Fear Itself #7.3: Iron Man (1 issue) - aftermath book
- Battle Scars (6 issue) - aftermath book
- Fear Itself: The Fearless (12 issues) - aftermath book by Cullen Bunn featuring Valkyrie tracking down the Serpent's hammers as they are property of Asgard, with Sin and Crossbones as antagonists. This is a lead-in to Bunn's 2013 book *Fearless Defenders* book featuring Valkyrie and other female heroes.
- Fear Itself Sketchbook (1 issue)

The event itself was kind of meh. They did use it as an excuse to change the status quo for some heroes. Notably Bucky was publicly declared dead during this event and Steve took up the Captain America mantle again.

### Post-Aaron

It's funny how many years passed during Aaron's run. The man wrote like 8-9 years worth of Thor!

#### Thor v6 (2020)

35 issues

This Thor volume was mostly by Donny Cates. It starts off immediately after the ending of [The War of the Realms](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/#the-war-of-the-realms-2019), with Thor now All-Father of Asgard and primarily dealing with cosmic threats such as The Black Winter which destroyed Galactus' original universe; Galactus ended up dying before Thor defeated the Black Winter. Thor also has to deal with his former alter ego Donald Blake, a corrupted spirit of Mjolnir and crossovers with Hulk ("Banner of War") and Venom.

Cates' run ends with #28. The last two arcs are written by Torunn Gronbekk (I think this is his only work I have read so far) and involve Thanos, Doom and Hela fighting over the souls of the dead and involve time-travel shenanigans and fatherhood issues. At the end of it, Odin is finally sent off to Valhalla. Who knows how long before he manages to come back?

The first arc with Galactus and the Black Winter was pretty good, but the rest of the volume was kind of forgettable. Though there are some moments there that remind us that unlike MCU Thor who is mostly just a space alien, comics Thor is a straight-out god who can handle cosmic-level threats. 

#### Immortal Thor v1 (2023)

### Wrapping Up

Whew, what a long post. Writing these is always exhausting! Captain America faces much more supernatural/cosmic cube shenanigans than I would have expected before reading all his books!

With that, we are caught up with the main Captain America books! By "main", I mean this should cover all the series that are included as part of Captain America's legacy numbering, and their associated side series and events. Beyond this point there is a new Sam Wilson ongoing (he still gets to continue the legacy numbering) and a new Steve Rogers series launching later this year. There are of course numerous standalone limited series and one shots starring Captain America that I have yet to cover and will need to figure out someday, but for now we can leave Cap alone for a while!

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 335. 

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 26 (!)

Total issues covered so far: 5,550 + 335 = 5,885

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 35,671 (+166 since the previous post)

Progress: 16.5% (15.63% last post). A decent jump.

### Up Next

Not sure yet what I am covering next, I am currently still catching up with ongoing series. Some options: 

- If we follow MCU movie order, we can continue reading Thor next; I've already covered a good chunk of modern era Thor in [the Jason Aaron post](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/) so there's a good chance we can cover most of the main Thor books in the next post. The high fantasy of Asgard would also be a good contrast/palette cleanser after the more grounded Cap stuff.
- I'm also kind of tempted to do a Punisher read, since he's the Marvel Netflix TV guy I haven't covered yet. He's another "grounded" hero, but kind of opposite to Cap ideologically.
- Something else?!?
