It is October! Spooky!

### The World

Some good news this week: Trump has put forward a Gaza peace plan that looks like it might actually end the "war". I believe Hamas has already "conditionally" agreed to the terms while Israel has already halted attacks. Ending the violence in Gaza is an unconditional good, though if Trump pulls this off we will never hear the end of it.

Locally, turmoil in local politics as corruption investigations threaten upheaval in the Senate leadership. Unsurprising given how many of them are corrupt.

There was a devastating earthquake in Cebu last week. Some BPO companies are being criticized for requiring their employees to return to work immediately after the quake and so on.

### My Week

- Kind of chill actually. Less rainy too. Not very productive though.
- One of our regular online gaming group is back in town for a couple of weeks, and that usually means we get together for boardgames. This time around we are doing *Pandemic Legacy*. We spent a couple of days this week powering through the campaign and should finish it next week. Might write a blog post about the game.
- On the blog: A [book review for Artificial Condition](/2025/10/artificial-condition/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to keep up with newer releases, and a new post is still pending.
- Books: Read and finished the next Murderbot Diaries book! Review linked above.

#### Watching

- Finished: **Sakamoto Days S2**
- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **Peacemaker S2**, **Only Murders In The Building S5**, **High Potential S2**.
- Movies: I actually haven't watched any new movies for a bit more than a month now! I really should get back to it, there's so many I want to see.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Chugging along still, in spite of everything.
    - **Magic Arena**: Alternating Omenpaths drafting with constructed. Managed to end the month in constructed mythic again!
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Hollow Knight: Silksong**. Got a couple of endings already! I am now struggling through the post-game Act 3.
- Despite me being far along in *Silksong* via PC Game Pass, a friend decided to gift me the game on Steam. I installed it and tried to import my Game Pass save to the Steam version, but found that my achievements did not carry over, so that was a nonstarter. When I tried to switch back to the Game Pass version, I found that because Game Pass had trouble loading my game library. It had recently been updated to act as a "hub" for your local gaming libraries (including Steam), so I assume it couldn't handle me having two different versions of the game installed. I ended up having to uninstall the Steam version to continue.
- Speaking of Game Pass, Microsoft announced price hikes for all their subscription plans, a ridiculously bad unforced error. Lots of people are unsubscribing. After some digging around, I found that the local (PH) price for PC game pass is going up from P175 to P320, a more than 80% increase! At this price, the subscription goes from being a good deal to barely tolerable. There are a couple of games I still want to play on the service, so I will probably keep it around until at least end of the year and then re-evaluate whether I want to keep the sub.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

My coughs and colds have recurred early in the week, coinciding with the supertyphoon. Combined with the rainy weather, that made it difficult to hit my step targets especially Monday and Tuesday. Thankfully, I managed to catch up later in the week and Google Fit tells me I walked 53,611 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I am happy to have even hit 50k steps, but that means beating last year's total step count is moving further out of reach.

### Links to Share

Nothing to share in this space today unfortunately. I have a lot of links saved up from trying (and failing) to power through the feed reader backlog though, will get around to them eventually. Hopefully I can start sharing some links again this week.

Check the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Looking Forward

More of the usual shenanigans I think. More hanging out with friends. Might have a fam get-together next weekend.
