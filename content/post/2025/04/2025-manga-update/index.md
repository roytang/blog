Haven't done this in a while. Just an update of manga I've been reading.

### Previously

These were all covered in my [2023 Manga Update](/2023/07/2023-manga-update/):

#### Akane-Banashi

Latest chapter: 155

Chapter count more than doubled since last time! A lot of things have happened, and the story surprisingly entered a three-year time skip! The manga remains pretty good. My one problem with it is that there are so many characters and rivals and other ranked rakugo members now that I get confused a lot with all their names and ranks and the whole hierarchy of which one is under which master and so on. I wonder if there's a chart somewhere I could reference?

#### Sakamoto Days

Latest chapter: 210

Not much new to say here; as is typical of shonen manga, the stakes have gotten a lot higher!

Relevant: [My review of the recently released Sakamoto Days anime](/2025/04/movies-tv-1q/#sakamoto-days-s1-part-1)

#### Martial Master Asumi

Finished with chapter 32.

This one didn't last long and ended a few months after the last post. Looks like it wasn't popular enough because the ending was super abrupt.

#### Spy X Family

Latest chapter: 114.1

Progress of the story continues to be slow (only around 30 whole number chapters since the last update!), and the author spends a lot of time on side missions like these point-numbered chapters. Still fun and wholesome though.

#### My Hero Academia

Finished with chapter 431

As expected, finished with a big shonen-style finale featuring almost everybody. Still hoping I can find time to watch the fights in anime for better appreciation.

#### One-Punch Man

Latest chapter: 209

I'm still reading this, but it comes out very rarely (monthly) and I am still confused by all the different hero characters (even moreso than I was with MHA), so I am not quite sure what's going on.

#### Dragon Ball Super 

Latest chapter: 104

Sadly Akira Toriyama passed away after my last post and I kind of assumed the series/franchise was just done, but apparently Toyotarou will be continuing the series! A new one-shot came out earlier this year, looking forward to what happens next.

Also, after reading through the original Dragon Ball manga (see below), I decided to back read through the earlier arcs of Super that I had skipped before, and I think I have now read all of it.

#### One Piece

Latest chapter: 1147 (!!)

In the last post I said:

> The author Eichiro Oda says the series is "close to the end" we are in the final saga, but that's kind of on a GRRM timeline and each saga can be 100+ issues or more so it's at least 2-3 years out before this actually finishes.

That was 112 issues ago, and it feels like we are still way off from the end and there is still so much that needs to be explained/resolved, so my new guess is maybe at least 4-5 more years of One Piece.

#### Hajime no Ippo

Latest chapter: 1491 (!!!)

At least One Piece did more than 100 chapters in the last 2 years; Ippo only managed 62 new chapters in the same period! Ippo is still retired and supporting other boxers. Since the last update we have had an absolutely brutal Mashiba match and now we are coming up on what promises to be an epic Sendo vs Ricardo world championship match. In the meantime, the author keeps dropping hints about how Ippo's skills and fundamentals have built up even as he is in a support role, whetting our appetites for the inevitable return.

### Classic Manga

These are older manga I recently decided to binge-read.

#### Dragon Ball

519 chapters / 42 volumes

Despite being a franchise fan, I have never read the original Dragon Ball manga before. The manga is pretty close to what was adapted for animation, with some exceptions. For example, the manga had a short crossover with Toriyama's other series Dr Slump that obviously never made it to the anime. The plot and storytelling are super simple and straightforward, often jumping to the next battle or crisis immediately after each one is resolved, with little space given for downtime or other things. 

The early volumes might be seen as a bit problematic, as there's a number of scenes like Master Roshi and Oolong being pervs. They are mostly for comedic value. There's one fight where in order to help Goku, Oolong forcibly exposes Bulma's breasts so that Master Roshi's explosive nosebleed splashes on an invisible enemy. This kind of thing tapers off after Goku leaves Roshi's tutelage, but still happens from time to time in the later volumes. (See the sexual harassment screenshot below.)

#### Ranma 1/2

407 chapters / 38 volumes

This was a seminal manga for me growing up, as it was one of the first times I was able to follow a manga regularly because a friend was buying the volumes. While I loved the manga and Takahashi's work in general, I was always annoyed at how Ranma's story never really progressed in the sense of his relationship with Akane. Now having binged and re-read the manga, I can see that the author was advancing the relationship, albeit very slowly, and given the characters and their situations, it might have even been understandable. The series ends without them ever in a formal relationship, but with a better understanding and acceptance of each other and how they feel (even if they have difficulty expressing it!)

#### Maison Ikkoku

161 chapters / 15 volumes

This was a re-read for me, and the only other Takahashi work that I ever finished. (Sorry Inuyasha, I'll get to you someday!). My friend who owned the Ranma volumes collected these too, and since this was an older manga, I think he was able to buy the complete set and thus it's one of the few series I was able to completely read back then (probably late 90s) without resorting to scanlations. I enjoyed it even back then, though you might have had some difficulty getting insecure teenage me to admit liking a romcom.

Maison Ikkoku is probably among the least well-known of Takahashi's work, and the only one that doesn't contain fantasy or sci-fi elements. Yet I find it superior to Ranma (one of her most popular works) in terms of hilarity, characters and plot. The main characters still fumble through life in a series of hilarious misunderstandings, but the story and their relationship and character arcs always progress and there is constant growth and a strong well-earned resolution to the story at the end. Even the side characters are great, and the mysterious Mr Yotsuya may be one of my favorite side characters in all anime/manga.

The series just has a very cozy story that's easy to get through and I can see myself re-reading it every so often.

### New Manga

These are newer series I only started recently.

#### Dandadan

Latest chapter: 190

Honestly I started writing this post mostly so I could write about Dandadan lol.

I started reading this in the middle of last year due to a friend's recommendation. It was sold to me as an upcoming anime about "coming of age with monsters and aliens and crazy fights!" and that turned out to be quite accurate. Long story short: it is very good, the art is excellent, there's great humor and the fights are indeed crazy. The story's pacing is excellent, with arcs that are never too long, and I think every other arc adds a new "party member", so there's never too many characters to keep track of (one of my weaknesses!). As an example of the kind of humor the series has: one of the focuses of the earlier arcs is that the main character has lost his testicles due to a curse and has to find them lol.

#### Jujutsu Kaisen

DNF.

I had been meaning to try this one out for a while because it seemed popular. I finally got a chance during one of my hospital stays last year. I made it a bit less than halfway through the run before I got bored with it and just quit. Later I read the final issue (#271 I think) just to see how far it got and it looks like they didn't even totally resolve the Sukuna thing at the end. Felt justified in not continuing! Honestly, I think my read through suffered from having just binged Dandadan, which kind of played in a similar "occult" space but was a much superior series in terms of story and characters. JJK wasn't bad, but to me felt like a very generic shonen anime trying to recapture the Naruto feel or something.

### What's Next

I don't read a lot of new manga these days, but I expect most of the ongoing series above to still go on for a while, so I suspect I will do one of these update posts every 2-3 years or so.
