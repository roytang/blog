Today is Palm Sunday.

### The World

Trump actually bumped up against reality and had to walk back a bunch of his global reciprocal tariffs, though he upped the tariffs on China probably in a bid to save face. Gaming consoles still affected!

### My Week

My week was not very busy, so I had time to indulge myself with some personal projects and such and such.

Earlier in the week, I was once again dealing with scraper bots hitting the site:

> <time id="114304706206109742">[[2025-04-09 06:30]](https://indieweb.social/users/roytang/statuses/114304706206109742) </time> <p>My personal site and it&#39;s rinky-dink server are once again besieged by some crawler that doesn&#39;t even bother setting a real user agent, instead hiding behind `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/127.0.0 Safari/537.36`</p><p>Get off my lawn!</p>

To help handle the problem, I deployed some pending site UI changes that would reduce the number of links visible to public viewers, so that bots aren't jumping to those pages and increasing the hit count unnecessarily. (I still need those pages for my own use, so the links are only visible to me.) The attack subsided after a couple of days.

Wednesday was a holiday (Day of Valor), commemorating the Fall of Bataan. Yes, we celebrate our defeats over here.

Thursday I [attended a quiz night with the trivia team](/2025/04/popquiz-tv/), but we did not win.

As part of our long-ongoing decluttering, I tried getting an old PS2 to work this weekend but ran into some issues with the video output. I [posted the details to reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ps2/comments/1jy0bfh/help_trying_to_get_an_old_ps2_to_work/), so maybe check that out if you have an idea.

On the blog this week: [Review for Avowed](/2025/04/avowed/) and also the [MTG set recap for Aetherdrift](/2025/04/mtg-aetherdrift/)!



### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Done with Brubaker's Cap run. I am wondering whether I should push to cover all the remaining Cap regular ongoings until present day; I've already covered some of them before, so it's not too outrageous.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm caught up with with: **Abbott Elementary**, **Daredevil: Born Again**, **Wheel of Time S3**. 
- Binge-watched: **The Residence** on Netflix. Finished 8 episodes in 2 days!
- Also re-started watching **The Simpsons** on Disney+. Since this is a new D+ account, I had forgotten where I had left off before, so I just chose a recent season and started there. It's easy to leave the show running in the background, so it's fine that I've seen these eps before.
- No new movies this week!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. New set (Tarkir Dragonstorm) dropped on Arena this week; I have started drafting, but it hasn't been going well so far.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Spider-Man: Miles Morales**
- Installed: **Blue Prince** via PC Game Pass. Heard some good things about this, but haven't tried it yet.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 62,080 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I broke the 70k streak! I was short on Wednesday because I couldn't leave the house, and was just too busy on Saturday. The weather continues to be unbearably hot, and I am starting to shower way too many times during the day.

    > '“My experience here is unfortunately not singular”, Francis says. “I have had many discussions with other game developers who interact with AI engineers and savants who believe our industry pipelines need 'fixing' by them and them alone. The only other similar experience I can think of as a comparison is a snake oil salesman insisting that their magic tonic will fix all of my problems that don't exist but they insist that I have.”'

Sometimes, the optimal outcome is to have done something well, created something meaningful, and then let it go."

    This post is an interesting combination of a review of a 1946 film, a discussion of operational data security tips, and a critique of authoritarianism.
