### Set Notes

- Aetherdrift was an above-average set for me. I got in a good number of events and my win rate was decent, highest for all of 2024 and 2025 so far, and bumped up my total winrate a little bit.
- It looks like I did the best with black-based decks. Green was very good in the format too, though I tried the WG vehicles/mounts decks a few times and couldn't really get it to work! Red was challenging to get working, but I did get a trophy with a red deck so :shrug:
- I did enjoy the format a lot as well! I was a bit worried that a set saturated with vehicles would be annoying in limited, but they kinda managed to balance it out with all the artifact removal. Fixing was good, I actually splashed fairly often. Speed was a fun mechanic that created an interesting tension as both sides were usually racing to get to max speed, very flavorful. A lot of the draft archetypes were new to this set, taking advantage of mechanics like speed, exhaust, and cycling. Many of the archetypes had good synergy spread across different cards that it was fun trying to get them to work.
- Most drafted commons I would guess would be Scrap Compactor and Camera Launcher!

### 7-x Draft Decks

Didn't get a trophy until my 7th draft in. Managed another one with draft #19, a couple of days before finishing up with the set. All of the 6es were also near-misses where I screw up the last match!

### Streaming videos

Someday I will find the time to stream my drafts again! Maybe for the FF set?

Tarkir: Dragonstorm looks great, though so far I have not done well in the drafts. Hope to get better at it!
