I meant to publish some reviews at the end of Feb but life got in the way, so instead I am doing these every 3 months now apparently.

### Movies

#### Easy A (2010)

Watched on 2025-01-19: ★★★½



{{% photos easy-a-2010 %}}

 I'm not too big on either Emma Stone or comedies about high school/teen life with the popularity drama and all, but I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. Olive's family was great and had some great scenes together, they were my favorite part.

#### Twisters (2024)

Watched on 2025-01-20: ★★★★



{{% photos twisters-2024 %}}

 I was a big fan of the original Twister, but this one had no Helen Hunt and frankly the protag didn't make a good first impression on me, but I was sold by the end of it. This sequel does a much better job of portraying the massive destruction caused by the twisters and the risks the storm-chasers chase and it was very exciting. I'm also glad there wasn't a strong romance aspect here.

#### Wind River (2017)

Watched on 2025-01-20: ★★★★



{{% photos wind-river-2017 %}}

 Finally decided to watch this one; I've had it on my list for a while, mostly because of Elizabeth Olsen, but this is mostly Renner's film. I was not prepared for how dark and intense it would be, but the film does a good job as a mystery/thriller and also increasing my awareness of how hard life can be out in these remote NA reservations.

#### The Beekeeper (2024)

Watched on 2025-01-22: ★★★★



{{% photos the-beekeeper-2024 %}}

 This was like 10 painful minutes of a senior citizen getting scammed out of her life savings followed by 1.5 hours of the protag going on an absolute John Wick-style rampage, tearing through scammers, security teams, cops, fbi, mercs, and even secret service. One of Statham's better films.

#### The Holdovers (2023)

Watched on 2025-02-11: ★★★★



{{% photos the-holdovers-2023 %}}

 The two leads started out very unlikeable, but they kinda grew on me by the end, same way they grew on each other. Ended up as a very cozy movie; reminds me a bit of Dead Poets Society, albeit with a much less tragic ending.

#### Captain America: Brave New World (2025)

Watched on 2025-02-13: ★★★½



{{% photos captain-america-brave-new-world-2025 %}}

 This was enjoyable, but felt way too... safe? The plot is straightforward and kind of predictable and there was supposed to be a mystery but if you had paid attention to casting news it was really no surprise at all. Would have had a lot more impact if the marketing hadn't all but revealed where the movie's third act was going! A bit too predictable, but thankfully had one surprise cameo that wasn't spoiled ahead of time.

Sam and Joaquin have good banter going and Esposito was great as usual but should have gotten more screentime. Sterns' practical effects were great and creepy as heck. Ford gives us a good performance. Carl Lumbly was very good. Very disappointed at no Rosa Salazar as Diamondback. 

A friend complained that there were a bunch of things he lacked context for, but I pointed out that almost everything was explained in the movie itself.

#### Despicable Me 4 (2024)

Watched on 2025-02-22: ★★★



{{% photos despicable-me-4-2024 %}}

 Needed some background watching yesterday and put this on before realizing I barely remember what happened in the second movie and hadn't even seen the third one. Didn't really matter. It was okay, family-friendly popcorn entertainment.

#### Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)

Watched on 2025-02-22: ★★★½



{{% photos terminator-dark-fate-2019 %}}

 I probably enjoyed this a bit more than I should have because T2 was probably the last time I really enjoyed a Terminator movie and this one hit the same kind of notes and had fan service towards that movie. Luna's terminator is scary and unstoppable and the whole liquid metal being able to operate independently of the skeleton was great. Mackenzie Davis was a badass here. The only real problem with this movie was the decision to kill off John Connor at the very start; totally unnecessary and could have just involved him in the movie instead of Sarah, though I think they really wanted Linda Hamilton back

#### Kingdom of Heaven (2005)

Watched on 2025-02-23: ★★★



{{% photos kingdom-of-heaven-2005 %}}

 This entire movie felt odd, like the performances felt a bit wooden and the editing and camera angles sometimes seemed like weird choices. Like the first act with Godfrey and Balian taking over his realm felt like they had no emotional impact and were just things happening one after another to serve the story. That being said, I enjoy a good siege and the one here was very good.

#### Venom: The Last Dance (2024)

Watched on 2025-02-25: ★★★



{{% photos venom-the-last-dance-2024 %}}

 The Venom trilogy deserved better than a lackluster ending like this that lacks any emotional heft. The instant Venom explains the codex you know how this is all going to end. Brock talking to himself was funny in the first film but kinda worn out by now. They tease Knull as the big bad but we only ever get a bunch of creepy crawlies.

#### Galaxy Express 999: The Movie (1979)

Watched on 2025-03-18: ★★★★



{{% photos galaxy-express-999-the-movie-1979 %}}

 I think the anime for this aired here in the PH back when I was a kid; I remember catching an episode or two (definitely one that took place on Pluto with Shadow) and not really understanding what was going on or appreciating the plot, but it looked really cool and the character designs called out to me despite the weird proportions. Same for this film version (though I understand the overall plot is a bit different). A very straightforward romantic hero sort of adventure with some great soundtrack choices too

#### Transformers One (2024)

Watched on 2025-03-20: ★★★★★



{{% photos transformers-one-2024 %}}

 As a Transformers fan, this was so good. So much fan service, even in the throwaway lines and shot poses and so on. An excellent adaptation/version of Transformers lore.

#### Kraven the Hunter (2024)

Watched on 2025-03-28: ★★½



{{% photos kraven-the-hunter-2024 %}}

 The Kraven in this film is nothing like the comics one. Who thought it was a good idea to have this character become an antihero and that he could carry a film independently from Spider-Man? He's like the least popular of the Sinister Six!

Every single Marvel character in this film is dumber than the comics version. Plot was meh and I found it hard to care what was going on with the brothers (especially knowing who Dimitri would become!). I did enjoy the fight with Rhino though.

At least they gave him the lion's mane vest in the end, I was waiting for that the whole movie.

#### A Real Pain (2024)

Watched on 2025-03-29: ★★★★½



{{% photos a-real-pain-2024 %}}

 I saw this on Disney+ and decided to watch it not knowing anything other than that Kieran won some awards for his performance here. A pleasant surprise, it was quite good. A film that swings wildly from comedy to drama and Kieran's performance was in fact excellent, though I found myself relating more to Eisenberg's David, anxious and exasperated at having to deal with his overly emotional cousin in front of other people. 

Also, that concentration camp scene just felt very heavy.

#### Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (2022)

Watched on 2025-03-30: ★★★½



{{% photos dragon-ball-super-super-hero-2022 %}}

 I had read the manga adaptation for this before watching the film, and I found out that the bit about Gohan and Trunks being superheroes was manga-only and was disappointed it wasn't here; it really added a lot to the story. Anyway, the film is fine, 3d animation is nice. No surprises story-wise since I've seen it before, but always nice to get a DB story not focused on Goku.

#### Spy (2015)

Watched on 2025-03-30: ★★★★



{{% photos spy %}}

 I watched this because of a Reddit thread about Statham's over-the-top character and I was not disappointed. As a pleasant bonus, the rest of the film and the plot were pretty good too, especially with the clever banter between the characters, especially Byrne and McCarthy.



[Review on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/spy/)

### TV

#### Penguin

Finished watching on 2025-02-06: ★★★★★

{{% photos penguin %}}

Excellent performances all around; Colin Farrell continues to be unrecognizable in the lead role, but the real standout here is Cristina Milloti's Sofia Falcone, a stellar portrayal of a very scary woman. The plot thankfully contains no actual Batman and is largely a monster film themed around Gotham, giving us a view of how tough life is in the caped crusader's city.

#### What If S3

Finished watching on 2025-02-08: ★★★

Somehow the scenarios this season seem even more frivolous than before, and some are simply thin excuses to put some MCU characters together. Some of the eps are still kinda entertaining to watch, but it feels like the stakes are so low. I wasn't even paying a lot of attention to the final "tying it all together" episode and had to rewatch it to remember what happened.

#### Pantheon S1

Finished watching on 2025-02-18: ★★★★

{{% photos pantheon %}}

I didn't like the animation style and character design too much; they weren't bad, just felt meh. That being said, the story was very good, if a bit depressing. S2 dropped shortly after I finished watching S1, but IDK if I have the heart to go on with it because their world feels so bleak, and frankly the S1 ending works by itself anyway and my headcanon can just be that's where it ended.

#### Invincible S3

Finished watching on 2025-03-13: ★★★★

{{% photos invincible %}}

Still very cool and a mostly faithful adaptation of the comic plotlines (though I hear we are getting an original storyline next season). That means it is of course absolutely brutal. Mostly looked good, though in some spots it seemed like they were lacking some animation budget. I enjoyed it enough that I dug up some old copies of the comics and re-read the relevant storylines covered by S3. The upcoming storylines still to be adapted from the comics promise to be even more intense!

#### High Potential S1

Finished watching on 2025-03-01: ★★★★

Heard good things about this one and have been deprived of procedurals for a while so I decided to start watching it on Disney+. It's yet another iteration of the procedural formula of "eccentric outsider with a special talent assists the cops", but it's a pretty good version. This time the eccentric is a "high potential" single mom with encyclopedic knowledge. The series is pretty good and there are some interesting cases in there (including the usual "solving a case under duress" trope, which kind of came really early in a series). It is based very closely on a French series, and the people on Reddit keep raving about how good the original is, but I'm not sure how I can watch it.

#### Elementary

Finished watching on 2025-03-27: ★★★★

{{% photos elementary %}}

High Potential was good but very short and left me with an itch for more procedurals. I saw that Elementary was on Prime Video, so I decided to binge it. Was surprised to find there are SEVEN SEASONS! Ended up binging it for most of March. This is a very good Sherlock Holmes adaptation that somehow managed to keep the same level of quality for all those seasons. This version of Holmes is still a misanthrope but experiences a lot more character growth compared to a version like the one from Cumberbatch's BBC series. 

Lucy Liu's gender-swapped Joan Watson initially meets Sherlock in NYC as a "sober companion" who helps recovering addicts and the series focuses a lot on the recovery process and a lot of Sherlock's character growth stems from that and from Watson's support. He eventually decides to take Watson on as a protegee and Joan grows to become a good detective in her own right. They mostly work with the NYPD with a sometimes strained relationship due to Sherlock's tendency to color outside the lines. Aside from Holmes and Watson there are some excellent versions of other classic Holmes characters like Mycroft, Moriarty, Lestrade and such. 

I enjoyed the series a lot and am mostly happy that they didn't ever try to ship Sherlock and Joan together! 

In the very last episode there is a time skip that would have put the ending smack dab in the middle of the COVID19 pandemic lol.

#### Dragon Ball Daima

Finished watching on 2025-03-11: ★★★½

Not as good as I would have liked, but it's still Dragon Ball so there are a few awesome fights in there and lots of silliness abounds. The extended fight against the final boss went on a bit too long though. The story does significantly expand the lore especially behind races like the Nameks, Majins, and Kaioshin's race.

Setting this after the DBZ Majin Buu arc but before Dragon Ball Super was always going to create continuity questions, particularly around power scaling and such, but I think all of that can be handwaved away by the fact that this mostly takes place in another more magic-focused realm, and combined with the curse placed on the main cast at the start, that easily explains how wonky the power levels are.

#### Sakamoto Days S1 Part 1

Finished watching on 2025-03-28: ★★★½

Kind of disappointed with how rough some of the characters look, especially Shin. But that's kind of always been the manga's style, so I guess it's understandable. S1 Part 1 was only 11 episodes long, but there should be a part 2 coming later this year. I've [read all of this before](/2023/07/2023-manga-update/#sakamoto-days) and it's pretty faithful, so no big surprises. The advantage of watching these stories animated is that the fight scenes should be much more awesome, but so far they haven't encountered any real heavy hitters as it's pretty early in the series; I'm looking forward to more The Order guys since those fights should be pretty good!

#### Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man 

Finished watching on 2025-03-31: ★★★★

{{% photos fnsm %}}

Since this was taking place in an MCU-adjacent timeline, I was initially thinking it would be a bit low-stakes like What If and wasn't too interested. I did watch an episode or two whenever the nephews came to visit as they enjoy Spider-Man. I binged the remaining eps last night so I could include it in this post and those last few eps really elevated the story, and I really like how the last ep linked back to the very first one.

One advantage of having a Spider-Man series instead of a movie is that there's a lot more time to focus on more street-level stories and characters and develop them, and this series takes full advantage, introducing a bunch of characters that would have been much harder to introduce in a 2-hour movie. There are so many fun pulls and deep cuts here! I especially appreciate all of this since [I spent the last couple of months reading A LOT of Spider-Man](/2025/03/cmr-spider-man/).

The animation style and character design is a bit goofy (kinda reminds me of [Dungeons of Hinterberg](http://localhost:8000/2025/02/hinterberg/) actually) but Spider-Man looks so good in motion. Hopefully season 2 doesn't take too long to come out!

### What Next

This entry turned out so long! I watched so much stuff! I need to think if this really needs to be a an every 3 months thing or just every 2 months so the posts don't get too long. Or maybe it depends on how much stuff I watched?
