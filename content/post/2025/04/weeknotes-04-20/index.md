Today is Easter Sunday.

### The World

Still pretty bad, I think. I am still mostly mentally checked out from the world's BS though, a privilege not everyone can have.

### My Week

This past week was Holy Week, which generally meant an extended weekend and many people heading off to the provinces and Metro Manila being relatively low population for a little while. We mostly stayed home, attended some Church services, that sort of thing.

I did take the opportunity to advance some of my side projects and push my [website gardening](/2024/10/website-gardening/) a bit more. And honestly spent a lot of time on the video games lol.

It is graduation season around here, and a couple of my *pamangkins* have graduated with honors! I claim it is because they had a smart *tito*.

Nothing new on the blog this past week. Should have something next week though!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Pushing ahead with the remaing Captain America main series so I can wrap them all up with a single post.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Finished: **Abbott Elementary**, **Daredevil: Born Again**, **Wheel of Time S3**. 
- Started: **Doctor Who S1** (Disney+). Actually I already started this a while back, decided to continue it since a new season is coming up. Show feels a lot more childish than it used to be.
- Ongoing background watching: **The Simpsons** on Disney+.
- Movies: Watched [The Wild Robot (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-wild-robot/). This weekend I also found myself rewatching Superman, Superman II and Superman III on Max. I had fond memories of these growing up and they are still fascinating to watch. Not sure if I'm gonna write letterboxd reviews for them.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Still drafting Tarkir: Dragonstorm.
- Finished: **Spider-Man: Miles Morales**! I'll try to write a review this week.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Blue Prince**. I had very little idea about this before going in, but it is strangely engrossing. I have yet to "finish" a run.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 60,159 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). The scorching hot weather continues, making it hard to walk during the day and restricting my options. That is my excuse for missing this week's quota.

    > "The rich are not scrambling to prevent collapse. They welcome it — because they know they’ll be the only ones left standing. While the rest of us are told to “sacrifice” and “tighten our belts,” billionaires are building bunkers, buying private islands, and hoarding resources for the dystopia they see coming."

    This essay is long and bleak. Sigh.

    I have been tracking my total spend for different categories over more than a decade, so nothing in this Steam page surprises me (and honestly Steam gaming has been pretty good overall anyway).

    This frivolity feels so 90s (I have just passed 100,000 bongo beats). Back in the day you would just download this sort of nonsense as executables off random websites, which seems like something super dangerous to do these days, so I'm glad this one is distributed using Steam

There is also a quiz night scheduled for this coming week, but the trivia team seems disinclined to attend.
