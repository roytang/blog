*(This game's title is a handful!)*

Previously: [Marvel's Spider-Man for PS4](/2018/11/spiderman-ps4/)

Wow, hard to believe it's been six and a half years since I played the first game! My PS4 usage leveled off towards the 2020s, so I never got into the sequel on console, and happily was able to snag it on Steam Sale last year, so I finally got around to playing. I finished the game in a bit over two weeks, roughly the same time as the first game. 100% achievement completion!

Honestly, this game is mostly the same as the first one, except with a different story (and Miles has a couple more powers than Pete). Which is fine, the first game was pretty good, but nothing revolutionary here. Web-swinging and combat still feel great, though I did need to use a controller on PC. 

The guy who voices Miles sounds a bit whiny though, especially compared to the animated Spider-Verse VA. And the antagonist is such an annoying character as well, considering we are supposed to feel a bit sympathetic given their tiles to Miles. The game also doesn't have a lot of regular Spider-Man villains, so we don't get any moments as awesome as the raft escape sequence from the first game. That being said, the rest of the story is pretty good and I always enjoy it when the community comes together to support Spider-Man.

Achievements: 50/50. Nothing too challenging here, though I did need to do a quick second NG+ playthrough.

Total playtime: 22.3hrs (vs 18.5 hrs on [HLTB](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/79859))

Overall: A worthy follow-up to the first game, though a bit same-y.

Next: I was looking forward to playing the actual sequel "Spider-Man 2", but because of Sony's PSN requirement / region-lock nonsense since the whole Helldivers 2 debacle, it is NOT available on Steam in my region. And I still don't have a PS5, so it may be a while before I get around to it. This game did make me want to read more Miles comics, though that may be quite a ways away on [my complete Marvel run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/).
