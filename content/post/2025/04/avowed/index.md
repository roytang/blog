I was looking forward to **Avowed** because I easily get drawn into these sort of Skyrim/Fallout-style of RPGs. I feel no need to explain the gameplay here beyond that comparison. 

The last game I played of this kind was [Starfield](/2024/11/starfield/) last year, which wasn't super great and had a large and expansive and yet very empty-feeling procedurally-generated universe. Avowed is kind of the opposite: it feels like it has well-crafted maps that aren't super huge but feel very dense. They are packed with encounters and exploration of every nook and cranny is rewarded with random loot or treasure chests. The world is divided into 5 areas, with free travel between the first 4 once you have unlocked each area (though there are rarely reasons to go back). The world does feel very "video gamey" immersion-wise; I never felt like I was exploring a fantasy world and just that I was playing a game.

A friend who was also playing the game said that he restarted a couple of times because he wanted to optimize/minmax his build, but I think that was unnecessary. I played on normal difficulty and my build was kind of all over the place as I kept trying out different things and I didn't have too much trouble with the bosses and such. I had a ranger/mage hybrid build that I carried to the end. You can easily respec, but I didn't bother for most of my run.

You will fight so many bears and lizard people and mushroom people. Well, one thing Avowed does well gameplay wise that isn't typical for this sort of game is that there is a strong element of platforming/parkour in the game, but it's rather well-designed; it's very obvious when you can leap across to a ledge and lift yourself up to it. Not in an Assassin's Creed kind of way, but in a 3d platformer kind of way, if that makes sense?

The story was... fine? I played Pillars of Eternity a bit back in the day, never finished it, so I wasn't super familiar with the lore, but there are a lot of helpful tooltips and text dumps (via books/scrolls you pick up) to help you learn about the world. One nice feature is that during conversations, some lore-specific words are highlighted and you have the option of bringing up a glossary of sorts that explains those terms. 

I think I got what is generally considered the "good" ending for this game, though as is typical for Obsidian, you have a lot of difficult choices to make along the way that each alter the ending you get slightly. I finished the game in around 47.5 hours; HLTB says [Main+Sides typically takes 44.5 hours](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/81115), so I'm not too far off.

I don't think I'm going for completion on this one because it requires another run on the highest difficulty and you have to side with a very unlikeable character/faction; I'd rather not lol. I did go back to do a few achievements after finishing the game, so I finish with 38/50 achievements and 790/1000 gamerscore.

Overall a solid and polished B+ game. IDK what would elevate it above that for me, maybe if they let me ride a dragon or there were some big epic fights or something.
