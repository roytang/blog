Last weekend of April!

### The World

Pope Francis passed away last Monday, a day after meeting US Vice President JD Vance. His funeral was this weekend. The pope's, not Vance.

### My Week

It has been a bit of an unproductive week; I am not sure where my time went, except that when the afternoon heat becomes unbearable, I tend to retreat to the aircon room and waste too much time just lying there reading or napping. I need to better schedule my day around this heat so I have more productive hours.

On Monday night, a pipe burst in my bathroom late at night and I had to rush downstairs to turn off the main valve, and we had to make do without running water for almost a day, which is really bad in this scorching hot summer. Thankfully everything has been fixed by now.

Had a couple of birthdays in the extended fam this week, so we had a quick get-together at home this weekend.

On the blog: A [review of the Miles Morales game](/2025/04/miles-morales/) and also [a 2025 manga update](/2025/04/2025-manga-update/).

I continue to be annoyed at the world and how it all works. 

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Am almost ready with a new Marvel post. Should be sometime in May. Gonna be a long one probably.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing (?): **Doctor Who S1**, **The Simpsons**. The (?) is there because I'm not really watching these too often.
- Started: **Andor S2**
- Movies: Rewatched Superman IV (1987) on Max, and also watched The French Connection (1971). I am however behind in writing my letterboxd reviews.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Still drafting Tarkir: Dragonstorm, still not doing very well. Completed the recent High Voltage run on Snap.
- Single-player games: 
    - **Blue Prince**: Spent way too much time playing this. I have "finished" the game by getting to Room 46, but this game still has so much more to solve. I have taken a few days away from the game because honestly it was consuming my brain space.
    - This week saw the release of both **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** and **Oblivion Remastered** on PC Game Pass! I kind of wanna try them both, but maybe E33 first since that one is totally new, and the reviews are great.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 57,643 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I missed the target on 3 days this past week, mostly due to errands conflicting with my usual walking schedule. The scorching hot weather continues.

    > "Bowls are, broadly speaking, easier than plates, and more versatile, but it’s more than that. If niceness and kindness aren’t synonyms but in fact closer to antonyms, plates are nice, and bowls are kind. Plates are the dining room; bowls are the kitchen. Plates are scarcity; bowls are abundance. Plates are capitalism; bowls are socialism. Plates are a backward longing for an imaginary twentieth century; bowls are the dream of a better world. Plates are small talk; bowls are the part of a party where everybody sits on the floor."

    IDK why I enjoyed this so much.

    > "The dominant group of users were now people who didn't care about - or even actively disliked - computers. They'd just been put in front of one in order to perform a small repertoire of simple tasks - and still ran into problems. The experiment with giving everyone geeky power tools failed, because everyone didn't want to become geeky power tool users."

    > 'The one group thinks it only affects the poor, the "not-white race", while the others fear that it could get worse but there's no sense in trying to do anything about it so they just enjoy themselves,' she told MailOnline.

    This is a very dumb way for our civilization to collapse

### Looking Forward

- Apr30: Thunderbolts*; I will probably go watch with my brother on Thursday. Early reviews have been good, I'm looking forward to this!

There is also a quiz night scheduled for this coming week, but the trivia team seems disinclined to attend.
