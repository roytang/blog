### The World

Nintendo had a 1-hour presentation early in the week to discuss the details of their upcoming Switch 2 console. Some of these games and features look great, but there weren't any announcements of new Mario or Zelda games (Mario Kart doesn't count!), so there is little to even make me interested in getting the console at this time. Not that I was planning to buy mind you! A lot of Nintendo fans are up in arms about the revaled prices - $450 base price for the console and it looks like we are looking at $80 games! But it's actually good for me as it makes it easier to avoid the console for a while; it's likely I don't get it until later in the cycle, if at all. (As always, any new Mario or Zelda release will strongly tempt me). 

Later in the week, in a move he dubbed "Liberation Day", Trump announced a host of "reciprocal" tariffs on every other nation in the world (and even some uninhabited islands), with a minimum of 10% tariffs based on a weird formula that uses import and export amounts as a proxy for trade barriers. The PH was hit with an 18% tariff rate, which is actually on the low side. Fellow SEA nations such as Vietnam and Thailand were hit with 46% and 37% tariffs respectively. It's hard to predict where the world economy goes on from here, though it feels like we are teetering dangerously close to a recession. 

The tariffs announcement was extremely bad timing for Nintendo, having just announced the Switch 2 prices. They had to temporarily cancel preorders in the USA and may have to adjust prices, possibly angering customers even more.

I think there are a bunch of anti-Trump/Musk protests happening this weekend?

### My Week

My week was pretty chill. Patient#1's test results came back good, so we don't have a lot to do for the next few weeks at least. I had my own much-delayed checkup this past weekend, and most of it was good, though there are some non-urgent things that I might need a specialist consult for.

Tuesday was a holiday over here (something like end of Ramadan?), so we had the nephews and nieces over for a bit of fun chaos.

A while back during our long-ongoing decluttering, we found a printer in a box under one of the beds. I thought it was one of our old printers that was no longer working, and I asked them to set it aside so I could look at it at some point. Fast forward a few months and I finally opened up the box and was surprised to find what seemed to be a practically brand-new printer, sealed with tape and with ink cartridges sealed in packets and all. The printer was an HP Inkjet 2010 K010a. I dug it all out and hooked it up (it had no wireless function, so needed to be connected to my desktop via USB) and loaded the ink cartridges and test printed some pages and it was working perfectly fine, except it mysteriously refused to print any color despite the HP software telling me both cartridges were full.

This raised the question: why did we have a practically brand-new printer from 2010 in the house? None of my brothers knew anything about it and I have no record of buying it so it remains a mystery. I am not sure what to do with it either (I already have a printer), so for now I packed everything up back in the box. Maybe I should just sell it?

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Reading some Captain America stuff, almost done with Brubaker's run, which has been very good.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. A fellow reader has chastised me for my slow pace.

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Abbott Elementary**, **Daredevil: Born Again**. 
- Started watching: **Wheel of Time S3**. I am only one episode in, but it was an explosive opening.
- Finished: **Elementary**! All 7 seasons! Also **Sakamoto Days** S1 part 1 (apparently there is a part 2 later this year).
- Watched some animated films: [Ponyo (2008)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/ponyo/) and [Zootopia (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/zootopia/)

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Avowed**, I should be very close to finishing the game. I also started playing **Spider-Man: Miles Morales** on Steam!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 70,497 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Third 70k week in a row! Saturday was a bit rainy, so I was a bit worried I wouldn't make it but luckily it cleared up. The days have generally been hotter but I think there has been no official announcement of *tag-araw* yet. All of this means sticking to my walking regimen will only become more challenging.
