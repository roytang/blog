There are people who get up in the morning with a clear and specific purpose in life, who go out into the world keen to take the next steps to realize their dreams. And then there are people who struggle through their life for their kids, trying to make a better world for them or just making sure they grow up safe and secure and as good people.

I can't relate. I've never felt a strong sense of purpose in life. There are things I want to do, but they are generally small, immediate things rather than long-term goals or aspirations.

Instead, I think what keeps me going is that I want to see what happens next.

It feels like I have lived through a world that has changed greatly in the decades I have been here, and we are perhaps on the cusp of another big change. Will the world overcome the rising tide of fascism? Will we learn to overcome hatred and distrust and embrace kindness? Will humanity foolishly collapse under the weight of our disrespect for the climate? Will we survive? Will AI eat the planet?

In my [weeknotes](/blog/tags/weeknotes/), I often end each post with upcoming releases I'm looking forward to. It's hard to run out, humans always have the best stories. Despite the best efforts of our AI-obsessed techbro overlords, I hope human creativity continues to thrive. What fantastic stories will I still live to see and experience? Will the MCU peter out and die or recover to find new heights? What happens to Mission Impossible after Tom Cruise? What new kinds of movies and shows will we see in the next decade? What fantastic new game concepts will I experience after Blue Prince and Clair Obscur? 

I just want to see what happens next.
