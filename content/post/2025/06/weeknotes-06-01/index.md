### The World

[RIP Peter David](https://www.avclub.com/peter-david-incredible-hulk-writer-obituary). He was one of the earliest comic book writers who I became aware of, mostly because a close friend followed his work. I loved his X-Factor books!

### My Week

Kind of a light week for me I think, though I did go out to places a couple of times this week. The usual bunch of errands kept me busy, especially since there was end of month stuff to handle.

Attended a wedding in the middle of the week! Well, a wedding reception/lunch. It was a civil wedding and a small guest list with no program, so it was really just lunch. Got to see some people I haven't seen in a while; it's always good to socialize and catch up with people every so often. (In moderation!)

Trivia team [attended a quiz night at one of our regular haunts last Monday and CRUSHED IT](/2025/05/aboutquiz-electives/).

On the blog: Wrote [a post with retro reviews of Nintendo DS games I played back in the day](/2025/05/nds-games/)!

### This Week In History

Eight years ago on May 31, Duterte's presidential communications office [released a terribly meme-worthy video promoting martial law](https://www.rappler.com/technology/social-media/171544-palace-defends-martial-law-social-media-video/). Also, Donald Trump did his "covfefe" thing on the same date! I collected some relevant posts/notes/shares/memes from that day into [a backdated blog post](/2017/05/govt-memes/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still focusing on catching up with recent comics for now, but the next [CMR](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post should be about Thor I think.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

Not a lot this week:

- Ongoing: **Doctor Who S2**, **The Simpsons**, 
- Movies: No new movies this week! 

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Final Fantasy releases on Arena in a bit more than a week!
- Single-player games: 
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: Lots of grinding out post-game content. Currently 9 achievements left for completion, but I dread the Gestral Beach one.
    - **Blue Prince**: Stepped away from the game for a few days to refresh my brain before I go insane.
- Fighting games:
    - Haven't played any fighting games in a while, so this weekend I decided to plug in ye olde fight stick, only to find that Windows no longer recognizes it D: (The USB controller says "device descriptor request failed" in device manager.) I spent some time trying to figure out the problem before giving up and playing a bit of **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter 6** with my controller instead. Mostly just achievement hunting and learning some new characters and losing badly in ranked. I think I may have gotten a bit better with a controller, but the fight stick would have been more precise I think. 
- Others: After writing the NDS games retro reviews post, I am kind of looking to do the same for some PSP games I used to play. To that end I have been toying around with a PSP emulator to check on my old saves! The post might take a while to come together though.


### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 55,074 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). No excuses here, was honestly just a very lazy week and didn't want to push it too hard on most days (only hit 10k twice!).

    > "Because people make technical decisions, in part, for affective reasons. They choose a technology because it feels good, or comfortable, or because it’s what they know. They choose obscure tech as a form of sympathetic magic...

    But many people can’t admit this to themselves! Because it is contrary to their identity: that they are unfeeling Cartesian rationalist automata. And so they invent rationalizations. Once you read enough of these posts, you see the patterns."

    > "Stop solely relying on one part of your life to define who you are. I can’t stress enough how important this is. Drastic changes aren’t necessary–taking small steps to develop new skills, knowledge, relationships, and interests will likely be the more sustainable route."

    These are interesting rules to live by, though I suspect following them strictly means missing out on at least sampling some newer experiences (which may or may not be a good thing)

- [Good Internet](https://goodinternetmagazine.com/)

    A magazine about the internet. Lots of articles about the web, blogging, personal websites, small web, etc.

- [The Who Cares Era | dansinker.com](https://dansinker.com/posts/2025-05-23-who-cares/)

    > "In the Who Cares Era, the most radical thing you can do is care. In a moment where machines churn out mediocrity, make something yourself. Make it imperfect. Make it rough. Just make it. At a time where the government's uncaring boot is pressing down on all of our necks, the best way to fight back is to care. Care loudly. Tell others. Get going."
