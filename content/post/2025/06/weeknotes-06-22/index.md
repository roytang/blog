### The World

The US has bombed Iranian sites, entering the conflict between Israel and Iran.

### Server Troubles

The server has had a lot of downtime this past week, as the site has apparently earned the attention of some scraper bots that Cloudflare wasn't able to mitigate. That or one of my posts went viral without my knowledge? Lol. Thinking about ways to handle this. I already have some ideas, but implementation might take a while. I am kinda tired of this nonsense.

Also for some reason, something was hitting my RSS feed URLs every minute.

### My Week

On the blog: Wrote [reviews for the Disgaea series games I have played](/2025/06/disgaea-1-4/) and [a ranty post about the web as a space to be explored](/2025/06/web-explorer/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still reading a lot!
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very slowly. 

#### Watching

Not a lot this week:

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**.
- Finished Watching: **Department Q** on Netflix. It was very good.
- Movies: Watched a few movies this week; reviews are up on letterboxd as usual and will be on the blog later this month. [The Foreigner (2017)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-foreigner-2017/), [Finding Nemo (2003)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/finding-nemo/), and [Deep Cover (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/deep-cover-2025/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. 
    - I continue to be doing poorly at drafting Final Fantasy on Magic Arena. I have been streaming some of the drafts and uploading VODs to Youtube. [Here's a playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXiBh9YDLeL_0dzXRUq9tpWN) if you wanna see me be terrible at drafting for some reason.
    - I am still doing regular Snap grinding, but it's gotten kinda tedious and annoying. The player base is super mad right now at the monetization for an ongoing limited time game mode and it's kinda infectious, so I'm thinking of just quitting. It just takes too much time to keep up. We'll see.
    - Maybe I should just focus on Eternal again lol
- Single-player games: 
    - Started playing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. Not very far in, though I believe some plot points have already been spoiled by the MTG set!
    - Also: Resumed my 11-year old save file on **Disgaea 4** on PS Vita (see the reviews blog post linked above for details.)
    - **Blue Prince**: Wow, I think I haven't played it this week. I should get back to that.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 55,508 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Missed the mark for like 3 out of 7 days I think. It's not too bad. However, this coming week's step total might be worse, as some circumstances might mean I won't be able to go walking for at least 2 of the days. I won't stress myself out over this coming week's step count I think.

### Links to Share

Not a lot today. My feed reader backlog is still huge.

    > "We need 20 year olds to have the freedom to try things, the freedom to explore, the freedom to end up having careers that they couldn’t have imagined at 20. Life requires a certain amount of curiosity and exploration. Life is an open world game. It rewards you for exploring. And capitalism cannot fucking stand that. It wants you on rails. Capitalism wants you to earn the living that life has already granted you."

### Looking Forward

Some routine labs for one of the patients this week. And I have to house sit alone for a couple of days this week, which means less walking.

Trivia team is gonna attend a quiz night on Wednesday. 

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:

- Jun 24 Ironheart (Three eps should be dropping this week!)
- Jul 11 Superman ([New trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyHEvDusigI))
- Jul 17 Strange New Worlds S3 
- Jul 25 Fantastic Four: First Steps

I am looking to restart my triviabot that was previously running on botsin.space, looking for suggestions for a new server.

> Until the end of 2024, I had a bot running trivia questions over on bots.inspace. Since that instance shut down, I haven&#39;t had time to migrate the bot elsewhere, and I&#39;m looking to do that now. Any recommendations for a server/instance I can use? The bot isn&#39;t high volume - basically 2 automated posts every hour.

Honestly just looking forward to July already!
