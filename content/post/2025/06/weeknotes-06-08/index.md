### The World

PAGASA says we are officially in the rainy season. Our Senate president seems to be stalling the impending impeachment of the vice president. US President Donald Trump has had a very public breakup with Elon Musk, who knows where that will go? It is a convenient distraction from threatening to unleash violence on the people protesting the ICE gestapo raids in LA.

### My Week

Stayed in most of the week; it was pretty rainy which was nice. Restarted some long dormant personal projects (they kind of got left by the wayside during my stressful periods in early 2024).

Friday was a holiday; we had my nieces and their folks over. They had a long string of trips over the past month so we hadn't seen them for a while. We were also supposed to have my other brother over but they weren't feeling well.

Saturday we had lunch at home with the childhood friend again. He convinced my dad to go with him to Greenhills to buy shoes (again).

No quiz nights attended this week! There was one this weekend that I wanted to support because the venue was nearer to where I lived, but Saturday is a tough sell for the team and the categories weren't even that good for us so we decided not to go.

On the blog: Wrote [my set recap for Tarkir Dragonstorm](/2025/06/mtg-dragonstorm/)!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Mostly caught up with new comics, started my planned Thor run, got annoyed at Journey Into Mystery missing an issue on Marvel Unlimited.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very slowly. I will get there eventually!

#### Watching

Not a lot this week:

- Ongoing: **The Simpsons**. Disney+ only got the back half of the current season this week I think, so I can finally finish it.
- Started Watching: **Rick and Morty S8**
- Finished Watching: **Doctor Who**. The internet managed to immediately spoiled me about the surprise at the end of the season even while I was still halfway through. 
- Movies: I didn't watch a lot of movies in May, so I'm hoping to watch a lot this month. I kicked this off with Edgar Wright's Cornetto trilogy: [Hot Fuzz (2007)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/hot-fuzz/), [The World's End (2013)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-worlds-end/), and [Shaun of the Dead (2004)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/shaun-of-the-dead/), in that order. I've watched two of these before, but watching all three of them in succession was fun.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Final Fantasy releases on Arena this coming week!
- Single-player games: 
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: Still grinding out post-game content. Three achievements remain; I might be able to finish it this week and write a review, if I can get past the dreaded Gestral Beach climbing parkour thing!
    - **Blue Prince**: Still playing sporadically. I keep having to take breaks because this game drives me insane.
- Others: While checking my old PSP save files, I was disappointed to find that I never finished **Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions**. Given that [a new remake was just announced](https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles), I decided to record myself finishing my save from 2008 and uploaded [the 2.5 hour long video to Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkHAhYyukLk). Unfortunately, I found out after uploading that I had failed to properly record my mic input so my commentary is not in the video, though a friend who was spectating occasionally replies to my silent comments.
- Not my stuff: OMG, ArcSys did a Marvel 4v4 fighter, it looks amazing! [Announce trailer for Marvel TOKON](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fbfrV5qqnU).

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 65,466 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). This is... not bad, especially given how rainy it has been the past week. I managed to hit the 10k target on 6 out of 7 days and didn't have time to complete Saturday.

### Links to Share

Rawr, my feed reader backlog has gotten a bit large again (currently at 500+ items). I know I can just mark them as read, but I wanna read all your weird posts!

    I would also like to do this, but I don't know if I can stomach the manual process he describes. Most likely I'd need to build out some tools. And just from archiving my old content on other platforms I can relate to his pain about the issues encountered when trying to archive other people's webpages or links like poor redirects, defunct services.

    > The professor said, “this is the most important psychological lesson I will teach you this semester. I’ve been doing this experiment on classes for the past 10 years and not one class has agreed unanimously because there’s always somebody who doesn’t want someone to have what they have because they don’t think they deserve it. Statistically only 10 of you will get a 95% or above.” Because in life, greed will always hurt you more than it helps you.

### Looking Forward

Final Fantasy drops this week on Arena! I haven't done any streaming of Arena to Twitch in a long while, so I am hoping to try to start that up again with this set, hopefully I manage to get my mic audio recorded this time.

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:

- Jun 24 Ironheart
- Jul 11 Superman
- Jul 17 Strange New Worlds S3 ([New trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBix8DzPcaE))
- Jul 25 Fantastic Four: First Steps

Still have so many things I want to get done, and I just keep adding more things to that list!
