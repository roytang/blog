The month is almost over; we hold on but time continues to slip through our grasp without fail. 

### The World

Today is Father's Day!

Israel was apparently not satisfied with their current genocide and decided to try starting a war with Iran as well. Trump had a birthday military parade this weekend that kinda flopped. The "No Kings" protests happening across the US were much more successful, or so I heard. Good for them.

A Boeing plane crashed shortly after takeoff in India. Only one passenger survived. I read that there are something like 100,000 flights taking off worldwide daily, so I'm actually a bit surprised (and thankful) we don't have more incidents given the scale. Still, most of the serious incidents seem to involve Boeing planes.

Over here in the PH, I am not at all disappointed with how our senate is handling the erstwhile VP's impeachment because I had really low expectations of them in the first place.

### My Week

It was a rainy week and I spent most of it indoors. I have a very long list of things I want to do; many items are related to this website and also to archiving a bunch of other stuff and decluttering and all that, and I made a bit of progress on that list. Not a lot for me, but any forward motion is always good.

No quiz nights this week, but last Friday I found out there was a quiz night happening at a resto near my place. Unfortunately, the team had no interest given the short notice; and also we don't particularly like this particular trivia provider. Instead I decided to go there to have dinner and just listen to some of the questions. The three rounds I witnessed did not improve my opinion of them.

On the blog: Wrote [a review for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](/2025/06/clair-obscur-expedition-33/)!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to keep up with new releases, but also started my run of Thor for my next [complete Marvel run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very slowly. I will get there eventually!

#### Watching

Not a lot this week:

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**.
- Started Watching: **Department Q** on Netflix. This had some good reviews so I checked it out. I am about halfway through the season I think, it is rather dark.
- Finished Watching: **The Simpsons**. I've watched something like 3 seasons over the past month or so, but I am not yet sure what I am going to write about them in the next reviews post. I mean, it's The Simpsons, there's not a lot new to say about them.
- Movies: Only movie I watched this week was [Mickey 17 (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/mickey-17/)

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. 
    - I have been drafting the Final Fantasy set on Magic Arena. It's a very challenging format (read: I am not doing well.) I have been streaming some drafts on [my Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy) and have some videos of up on [my Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@roytang)
- Single-player games: 
    - Finished/completed **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**! Review linked above.
    - **Blue Prince**: Still playing sporadically, making a bit of progress. Still drives me insane.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 62,076 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Despite the rainy week, I managed 10k on 6 out of 7 days then just completely spaced out on Saturday.

Still so many items on my backlog!

- [A neutral stance is for weightlifting, not for human rights - annie's blog](https://anniemueller.com/posts/a-neutral-stance-is-for-weightlifting-not-for-human-rights)

- [The Internet of Consent - Anil Dash](https://www.anildash.com//2025/05/27/2025-05-27-internet-of-consent/)

    > "There's a common thread that ties together concerns about privacy, security, even just basic usability for so many of the tech products we use today. It just boils down to whether the people who make the technology that we use believe that we should be in control. It's simple: Technology should only ever do exactly what we have explicitly given it our consent to do. The institutions that don't understand that basic principle need to start paying a heavy cost for their transgressions."

- [Jim Nielsen’s Notes - “Large Language Muddle”](https://notes.jim-nielsen.com/#2025-06-13T0927)

    > "Now — in a strange twist of irony — things seem to have flipped:

    1999: Individuals use digital tools to steal intellectual property from corporations.

    2025: Corporations use digital tools to steal intellectual property from individuals."

- [My website is my safe space, Sightless Scribbles](https://sightlessscribbles.com/posts/20250606/)

    > "The modern mainstream web sucks. This is why I stay in the small web. I'm done playing it's games. I'm old. I want to have my own space where people can come and go as they please. People should be chasing me, not the other way around."

    > "Maybe right now when everyone is busy scaling up, the wiser path is to focus and scale down."

- [Changing Directions - Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org/2025/jun/3/changing-directions/)

    > "When I began, I held straightforwardly techno-utopian ideas: I believed that technology was an unalloyed force for Good, that the computer revolution would bring about a more just and equitable society. I thought the industry was going to create a Star Trek-esque post-scarcity society."

    > "I cringe at past-Jacob’s naiveté. It’s been incredibly demoralizing to discover what the tech industry actually did was to invent surveillance capitalism, create exploitative “gig economy” business models, create a new generation of robber barons, enable the rise of global fascism, facilitate genocide, and I could go on but Christ I’m exhausted."

    As someone who is still unsure where to go next in terms of "career", I find the frustration with the direction of the tech industry very relatable.

- [Firefox OS's story from a mozilla insider not working on the project](https://ludovic.hirlimann.net/2024/01/firefox-oss-story-from-mozila-insider.html)

    Mozilla has to be one of the most poorly-managed tech companies of all time. It's a miracle that Firefox is even still viable in spite of everything.

- [Building a personal archive of the web, the slow way – alexwlchan](https://alexwlchan.net/2025/personal-archive-of-the-web/)

    I would also like to do this, but I don't know if I can stomach the manual process he describes. Most likely I'd need to build out some tools. And just from archiving my old content on other platforms I can relate to his pain about the issues encountered when trying to archive other people's webpages or links like poor redirects, defunct services.

### Looking Forward

Trivia team is planning to attend a quiz night on Friday with a new provider, hopefully it's good.

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:

- Jun 24 Ironheart ([New trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6j-wSIqJJ0))
- Jul 11 Superman ([New trailer!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyHEvDusigI))
- Jul 17 Strange New Worlds S3 
- Jul 25 Fantastic Four: First Steps

With Clair Obscur done, I'm hoping to start playing Final Fantasy XVI, which I picked up on Steam sale a few months ago, in anticipation of playing it in parallel with the MTG set.

Still have so many things I want to get done, and I just keep adding more things to that list!
