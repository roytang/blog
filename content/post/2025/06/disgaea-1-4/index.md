*Afternoon of Darkness* is the PSP re-release of the PS2 original game *Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness*. I never played any of the series' games on console, only on handheld, and it's actually an excellent choice. The games feature a lot of grinding and having them on a portable platform that can sleep at any time is pretty handy.

The first game introduces what I consider to be the core features that are mainstays of the series:

- A goofy story that often parodies common tropes about an upstart aiming to overthrow the ruler of a Netherworld
- Turn-based freeform "tactical" battles. I put "tactical" in quotes because this isn't really strategic or tactical in the way games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem are though many of the core concepts are similar. In Disgaea, most enemies can be overcome simply by grinding levels, and most unit abilities do only one of four things: deal damage, heal damage, buff stats, or reduce stats (no effects like Haste or anything like that). There are many, many abilities with a large variation in things like range and area of effect and each has it's own (often goofy) animation. This isn't too say battles aren't deep or complicated - they're just not complicated in the same way as other tactics games.
- Freeform map deployment and action execution: You choose on the fly during your turns which units to deploy (unlike other tactics games where you have to decide at the start of the battle) up to a limit. You can have deployed units execute actions in any order, even in multiple batches.
- The ability for units to "lift" and "throw" each other on the map, which can grant increased mobility and ways to solve maps.
- What I consider the main gameplay selling point of the series: insanely high numbers. In a time when most RPGs limited you to level 99 and 9999 damage numbers, Disgaea has a level cap of 9,999 and lets you deal millions of damage (later games increase the caps even more). (My stats from this game tell me I never got near those numbers.) If you are the type to minmax stats and over-optimize your characters, this game is for you.
- Main story missions have fixed maps and enemies and levels. Many will have a sort of puzzle element in the form of geo panels/effects that you need to consider during combat.
- "Item World": Basically randomly generated dungeons that you can go through in order to improve your items' stats. 
- Lots of available character classes and monster classes that you can add to your party, each with different ability sets and stat growth numbers.
- Lots and lots of post-game and new game+ content.
- A legislature/Senate-type body (called the "Dark Assembly" in this game) where you can submit "bills" and try to get them passed. You can try to bribe the senators to vote your way. If the vote doesn't go your way, you have the option of using force and the assembly becomes a battle where you have defeat all of those who voted "Nay". It can be quite difficult early on because some of the senators will be very high level.

There's probably more that I'm forgetting; the series is generally very feature-rich, and each successive game usually takes the core set of features above and adds or improves upon them as needed.

As the first game in the series, the story here remains the best in the series, establishing many of the series' tropes and standards. There's a reason the main characters Laharl and Etna have made appearances in each successive game in the series and why it's the only game to get a direct sequel with the same cast (Disgaea D2 released for PS3 in 2013; I have never played it.)

In addition to the original game's story, the PSP version adds an "Etna mode" story where you play with Etna as the main character. Based on my PSP save, I finished both the main story and Etna mode and the save is on the very start of the 3rd NG+ cycle. It looks like I did not dive into the post-game content for this game.
