### Intro

I recently saw a trailer for Disgaea 7 Complete on Switch2 and I got to thinking about the series and realized I never wrote any reviews for them despite having played the first four games a ton. The series on a whole is I think an acquired taste, but for the right person who can easily get drawn into games with lots of grinding and power leveling and optimization and minmaxing it can really such up lots of your time. Or even if you just really love stats (that's me!) I played enough to finish the main story in each game, but never got too far in the post-game and certainly not enough for completion. Here are my thoughts on each one (D1 gets the most thoughts because it was first!)

*(This post is mainly an excuse to log stats from my saves loljk maybe idk)*

### Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness (PSP)

- Main story completed: 2008-03-22
- Etna mode completed: 2008-05-11
- Total playtime: 82.75 hrs
- Last played: 2008-05-11
- Number of cycles: 3
- Max level: 162
- Max damage: 9,909
- Collection level: 29.49%
- Max item world level: 20
- Enemies killed: 5,005

*Afternoon of Darkness* is the PSP re-release of the PS2 original game *Disgaea: Afternoon of Darkness*. I never played any of the series' games on console, only on handheld, and it's actually an excellent choice. The games feature a lot of grinding and having them on a portable platform that can sleep at any time is pretty handy.

The first game introduces what I consider to be the core features that are mainstays of the series:

- A goofy story that often parodies common tropes, about an upstart aiming to overthrow the ruler of a Netherworld.
- A central hub location that acts as a base from where you can start story missions and access other gameplay features.
- Turn-based freeform "tactical" battles. I put "tactical" in quotes because these aren't really tactical in the way games like Final Fantasy Tactics or Fire Emblem are though many of the core concepts are similar. In Disgaea, most enemies can be overcome simply by grinding levels, and most unit abilities do only one of four things: deal damage, heal damage, buff stats, or reduce stats (no effects like Haste or manipulating turn order or anything like that). There are many, many combat but they mostly just vary in range and area of effect and each has it's own (often goofy) animation. This isn't too say battles aren't deep or complicated - they're just not complicated in the same way as other tactics games, and a lot more emphasis is on how you prep for battles.
- Freeform map deployment and action execution: You choose on the fly during your turns which units to deploy (unlike other tactics games where you have to decide at the start of the battle) up to a limit. You can have deployed units execute actions in any order, even in multiple batches.
- The ability for units to "lift" and "throw" each other on the map, which can grant increased mobility and ways to solve maps.
- What I consider the main gameplay selling point of the series: insanely high numbers. In a time when most RPGs limited you to level 99 and 9999 damage numbers, Disgaea has a level cap of 9,999 and lets you deal millions of damage (later games increase the caps even more). I never got near those numbers in the first game! If you are the type to minmax stats and over-optimize your characters, this game is for you.
- Main story missions have fixed maps and enemies and levels. Many will have a sort of puzzle element in the form of geo panels/effects that you need to consider during combat.
- "Item World": Basically randomly generated dungeons that you can go through in order to improve your items' stats. 
- Lots of available character classes and monster classes that you can add to your party, each with different ability sets and stat growth numbers.
- Lots and lots of post-game and new game+ content.
- A legislature/Senate-type body (called the "Dark Assembly" in this game) where you can submit "bills" and try to get them passed. You can try to bribe the senators to vote your way. If the vote doesn't go your way, you have the option of using force and the assembly becomes a battle where you have defeat all of those who voted "Nay". It can be quite difficult early on because some of the senators will be very high level.

There's probably more that I'm forgetting; the series is generally very feature-rich, and each successive game usually takes the core set of features above and adds or improves upon them as needed.

As the first game in the series, the story here remains the best in the series, establishing many of the series' tropes and standards. There's a reason the main characters Laharl and Etna have made appearances in each successive game in the series and why it's the only game to get a direct sequel with the same cast (Disgaea D2 released for PS3 in 2013; I have never played it.)

In addition to the original game's story, the PSP version adds an "Etna mode" story where you play with Etna as the main character. Based on my PSP save, I finished both the main story and Etna mode and the save is on the very start of the 3rd NG+ cycle. It looks like I did not dive into the post-game content for this game.

*(Don't worry, the other 3 games will have much less words!)*

### Disgaea 2: Dark Hero Days (PSP)

- Main story completed: 2012-06-30
- Axel mode: UNFINISHED
- Total playtime: 60.75 hrs
- Last played: 2012-07-07
- Number of cycles: 1.5
- Max level: 154
- Max damage: 18,471
- Collection level: 31.51%
- Max item world level: 23
- Enemies killed: 4,041

*Dark Hero Days* is the PSP re-release of the PS2 original game *Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories*. Dark Hero Days adds an "Axel mode" with a different protagonist (similar to the previous game's Etna mode), which apparently I never finished. My save is on chapter 3 out of 4, so it was only a bit more!

The game is more of the same, but I'm not fond of the protagonist in this one; Adelle is kind of a boring goody-two-shoes. I found the secondary protagonist Rozalin much more interesting. Notably, Adelle is the only protagonist in these games that isn't a demon (at least as far as I can tell). 

Also I hadn't realized that this game actually includes the Magichange feature from D3, since the D3 base game came out before this re-release of D2. Magichange allows monster units to transform into weapons for human units to wield.

### Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention (PS Vita)

- Main story completed: 2013-08-27
- Total playtime: 86.33 hrs
- Last played: 2014-08-09
- Number of cycles: 1
- Max level: 6,552
- Max damage: 4.679 million (!!)
- Collection level: 31.51%
- Max item world level: 100
- Enemies killed: 9,670
- Achievements: 28 out of 54

*Absence of Detention* is the PS Vita re-release of the PS3 *Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice*. This game introduces new gameplay features like the aforementioned magichange, the ability to stack multiple units into a tower, and "evilities" -- basically static abilities that units can learn and equip.

The story is a bit meh; I found the protag Mao not especially likeable. But I really got into the gameplay and especially the post-game. This was the only one where I really did a lot of grinding levels and got to deal millions of damage and also managed to get the item world to max level. The fact that Vita games have achievements helped me get really into this one, but even then I was a far cry from completion. HLTB has completion run averages at more than 150 hrs, no way I would have had the patience for that!

### Disgaea 4: A Promise Revisited (PS Vita)

- Main story completed: 2015-08-12
- Total playtime: 54.5 hrs before 2025
- Last played: ONGOING
- Number of cycles: 1
- Max level: 3,281
- Max damage: 164,348
- Collection level: 34.14%
- Max item world level: 40
- Enemies killed: 6,487
- Achievements: 20 out of 51

*A Promise Revisited* is the PS Vita re-release of the PS3 *Disgaea 4: A Promise Unforgotten*. This version added more features like demon fusion, and character world.

The protag Valvatorez and his butler Fenrich are a bit more interesting than the previous two protagonists. I never got too much into the new features and the postgame, I think I only ever did one Chara World run and didn't even recruit most of the cameo characters. Based on the saves, it looks I stopped playing shortly after I finished the main story, but then I resumed playing a bit in 2017, and a bit more in 2021. 

I think that's a great thing about this series though: it's so easy to get drawn into it and pick it back up again and just play a bit more until you get tired of it again. In fact, in the course of loading saves and prepping this post I ended up playing more of D4 and unlocking a couple of new achievements and grinding some levels and optimizing my Cam-PAIN layout and... welp, I guess I am playing this again. (*Marks the game as ongoing.*)

{{< collections-embed albums disgaea-1-4 d4- >}}

I'm amused that I ended up getting drawn back into D4. I'm sure it won't last - I don't have a great attention span and there are many other games to play and all the grinding can get to me. But I don't have a problem with picking the game back up again and revisiting it every so often and maybe one day even completing it?!? And even if I manage to do that, there's still my D3 save!

### Outro

Turns out that all the mainline Disgaea games are already available on Steam, with the notable exception of Disgaea D2 which is still stuck on PS3. I'm a bit interested to see what improvements have been added in the most recent games but I don't see myself playing any of the newer ones - the games are huge and take up a lot of time and patience. Besides, as mentioned above, I'm pretty happy just revisiting D4 every now and then. The series is pretty good for the right people though; I know certain friends who could easily sink hundreds of hours into games like these if he ever got around to it.
