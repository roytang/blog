These weeknotes are coming in late because I was busy yesterday. 

Tomorrow is July! I am looking forward to July mostly because of the movies being released. 

2025 is almost 50% done! It hasn't been great so far.

### The World

Iran and Israel have entered a ceasefire. Everyone is claiming victory. Trump si mad because intel leaks suggest they haven't wiped out Iran's nuclear program like he announced.

### My Week

It was surprisingly a busy week for me. Some medical errands for Patient #1's routine labs. Trivia team attended [a quiz night on Wednesday](/2025/06/popquiz-feast-of-flavor/) and did poorly. Had to house sit three times this week since the parents had stuff to do. Visits from the pamangkins. Etc etc. 

Kind of falling behind on all the stuff I want to do, but honestly, that's not new. I remain unhappy with how time and mortality and responsibility restrain me from doing everything I want to do.

On the blog: Nothing extra this week!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still reading a lot! Really enjoyed the 1997 Thor volume and have already started the 2007 volume which features one of my favorite artists!
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** had no progress this week!

#### Watching

Not a lot this week:

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**.
- Started watching: **Iron Heart** on Disney+. I am only a couple of eps in, but I am not happy with Riri Williams starting off as a delinquent and a criminal!
- Movies: Looks like I only watched [Finding Dory (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/finding-dory/) this past week. 

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**. 
    - **Eternal Card Game** has kind of fallen by the wayside. I still want to get back to it and finish a bunch of single player content, but there's not a lot of time!
    - **Marvel Snap**'s recent High Voltage Overdrive event was tedious and players hated the greedy monetization, and then they immediately started another limited time game mode! I still want to do the normal ranking up and Conquest!
    - Still drafting Final Fantasy on Magic Arena. My win rate has been improving a little bit the last few days, though I haven't been able to stream recently.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. The game's performance is kind of problematic, even on low settings. I initially thought my hardware was just too weak for it, but a friend told me it was a known bad port and Steam reviews confirm. Sigh. Still, will try to power through.
    - Also ongoing: **Disgaea 4** on PS Vita. I initially told myself I'd only play it every so often, but the in-game playtime count suggests I have already played more than 20hrs since I wrote the review the previous week, and that's kind of a lot! It's just so easy to pick up and play with a mobile platform like the Vita!
    - Stalled: **Blue Prince**. Haven't played this in a while. Wondering if it's time to write the review and move this to the "revisit every so often" pile.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 50,453 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), which is worse than previous weeks. Only 3 out of 7 days hit the target! Part of that was due to busyness and part was due to weather, and part was due to being stuck house-sitting and unable to go out. Hopefully I can recover a bit this week!

### Links to Share

Unfortunately nothing today. I have been trying to keep up with the feed reader, just haven't had time to process links.

Check the [linkblog](/links/) for past links.

### Looking Forward

There are some quiz nights we **could** attend this week, but early indications are we won't.

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:

- Jul 11 Superman
- Jul 17 Strange New Worlds S3 
- Jul 25 Fantastic Four: First Steps
