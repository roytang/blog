title: 'Clair Obscur: Expedition 33'
---

When I saw a preview of **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** earlier this year, I initially dismissed it as a game that wasn't for me because of the whole dodge/parry mechanic which a lot of hardcore soulslike players enjoy and that I know I am terrible at. But then it was available on PC Game Pass at launch and I was like "Okay, I'll try it out." I am glad I did.

This is a fantastic game. The grim story and the visuals and aesthetic are outstanding. It reminds me a bit of the Persona series in terms of flashiness of the UI design, though the tone of the games are very different. The soundtrack is distinct and outstanding, even to someone like me who is terrible at appreciating music technically. 

Even though the game is developed by a French studio and the flavor and character designs are reminiscent of the Belle Epoque era of France, the game plays out distinctively like a JRPG. You progress through the world and story while fighting monsters in turn-based battles and interacting with NPCs, buying items from shops, exploring the map, finding secrets, all of that good stuff.

I found the monster designs fascinating; a friend describes them as "elegantly grotesque". Even the "regular" enemies you face on the field usually have unique designs and attack patterns to learn.

My worries about the dodge/parry mechanics were a bit overblown. Basically for most attacks you can choose to dodge or parry each hit. Dodging is easier (has a more forgiving timing window), but has little benefit other than avoiding the damage. Parrying has more strict timing and is more difficult but also more rewarding. Successful parries give back action points and if you parry every hit of an attack -- most enemy attacks will have multiple hits -- your character gets to execute a devastating counter attack. I still found it challenging, but given the fallback of just dodging as needed, I was able to manage. That being said, I still did not bother attempting to beat the game's optional superboss by parrying all his attacks; some of them require something like 20 parries I think! 

The story and characters are excellent and there are some fun bonding moments among your team even amidst all the horror and sadness they face. Each character has a unique set of combat abilities and can equip Pictos (accessories) and Luminas (abilities) to further customize your build. The Pictos/Lumina system is great; it reminds me a lot of the mix-and-match capabilities found in many JRPGs like the Final Fantasy series and there are some devastating combos you can set up later on.

### Endgame and Completion

The game has two endings! The decision point as to which ending you get happens at the very end, so you can just reload your save to see the other ending. It is a testament to how good the game's story is that either ending can arguably be considered the "good"/better eding, depending on your POV.

The music and the visuals and the cinematics combine to make many of the boss battles feel quite epic. My favorite battles because of this are the boss fight at the end of the Forgotten Battlefield, and the final story boss of the game (before the endgame decision point).

The game is divided into 3 acts and you can finish the main story as soon as you enter act 3!

I finished the main story on May 19 with around 30 hours gameplay and at levels 51-52 or so. Even after you finish the main story, there is a lot of postgame content; optional quests and bosses and such. I finished completion today, Jun 10, with around 63 hours gameplay and at level 99. 

[HLTB](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/152016) has main story runs averaging 27.5 hours and completionist runs at 62.5 hours, which is spot-on for me!

Most of the achievements required were okay: completing collections and beating optional boses and stuff like that. The very last achievement I got was the most annoying one: the Gestral Beach minigames. Specifically the one I had the most trouble with involved platforming to climb up a needlessly high structure. (More on this below.)

### Flaws and Nitpicks

If the game has a flaw it's this: it has some minor platforming elements, and the platforming is terrible. It's wildly inconsistent and there's no real way to tell whether you can fall off an edge or you can jump onto a platform or grab onto a ledge until you try it. That was what made that final Gestral Beach minigame so frustrating and rage-inducing. I actually didn't spend too much time on it, but that's mostly because I could feel my BP beginning to rise every time I had to start over. I was so frustrated earlier today that I looked up [a Youtube video of the minigame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnG8_h--qM) to see how far I still had to go. Turns out I just needed to advance a tiny bit more, but the highlight for me was [the comment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcnG8_h--qM&lc=UgyziuRqnthkcRJLkwd4AaABAg) saying "Ah, yes, the hardest super-boss in the game." YES!!

My only other nitpick is a UX one: the menus for selecting and equipping Pictos (accessories) and Luminas (abilities) can get quite unwieldy once you have a lot of them, and in act 3/postgame, I often had trouble finding in the list any new Pictos that I picked up. A filter/sort option for "new" items would have been nice.

### In Conclusion

Nitpicks aside, I still consider the game a masterpiece, and am glad I picked it up despite my earlier misgivings!
