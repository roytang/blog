title: the web as a space to be explored
---

A couple of articles I read recently about the doom of "the web":

- [Is Google about to destroy the web?](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20250611-ai-mode-is-google-about-to-change-the-internet-forever)
- [AI agents mean the death of the web](https://www.cio.com/article/3996243/ai-agents-mean-the-death-of-the-web.html)

The first article says:

> Google says a new AI tool on its search engine will rejuvenate the internet. Others predict an apocalypse for websites. One thing is clear: the current chapter of online history is careening towards its end. Welcome to the "machine web".
> 
> The web is built on a simple bargain â€“ websites let search engines like Google slurp up their content, free of charge, and Google Search sends people to websites in exchange, where they buy things and look at adverts. That's how most sites make money.

Except that last paragraph isn't true at all. That "bargain" is not what the web was built on. The web predates Google and search engines. The web is about people putting information online to be shared with other people. This "bargain" came in because capitalism demands things make money, and while we may have gotten some good "content" out of it, we also got a lot of modern-day plagues: spam, clickbait, content farms, scammers, surveillance capitalism and so on. Just because the majority of modern web users grew up with this "bargain" doesn't make it fundamental to the open web.

The second article says:

> The goals here are obvious: Web browsing and online tasks are not something that you should have to do; everything should be taken care of for you by AI agents.

Web browsing isn't something that I feel like "I have to do." I mean sure, if all you use the web for is looking up dictionary definitions, checking movie showing times, or booking plane tickets, I can understand wanting to delegate that stuff to a computer. (Never mind if the computer is actually good at it.) But I realize when these recent articles talk about the doom of the web, they are primarily talking about the modern commercial web full of websites trying to sell you stuff and content farms trying to get your views so they can earn money off ads.

That's not the web as I first encountered it. When I first started going online, for me the web was a wondrous invention, a space to be explored. Even now I still consider it so. 

A place were people from all over the world put up information and you can read all of those web pages and talk to all these people everywhere, all for free! Where you people would be posting web pages full of links to other web sites and you would click through these to see what wonders await on the other side. Where you could visit forums to discuss a variety of topics. Or you could go down deep dives on websites like Wikipedia or TVTropes, treasure troves of factual or cultural information. Or you could visit other people's websites to see what recent changes they've made and wonder how they made such interesting designs work or read some rants they've posted. And those people would often be linking to their friend's websites or to other interesting places. And many websites would have feeds you can subscribe to using RSS or Atom, using a feed reader of your choice, to make things easier. 

"Internet Explorer" ended up being a pretty good name for a browser actually; because for me, that's what the web was mainly for: exploring. I could wander and choose where to go, what sites to visit, what links to follow, what feeds to subscribe to, what rabbit holes to fall into.

After some time as more people joined the web, it started to become more commercialized and platforms started to emerge to centralize experiences, until the web famously became ["five giant websites filled with screenshots of the other four"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUaTsSMSbcU). I think it's not necessarily a problem to have platforms where people can post -- not everyone can be expected to have the time or capacity to run their own website after all. But it is a problem when those platforms aren't open and are incentivized to keep their users trapped in the confines of their platforms.

Writing this post made me realize that one of the reasons I was so annoyed at big tech platforms switching from chronological to algorithmic feeds is that it was an attempt to take away the agency of web browsing away from us. Their feeds would just serve us "content" that the algorithms think we'd enjoy, to save us the "trouble" of browsing and exploring the web to find that "content". This isn't necessarily problematic -- there is a place for random walks to find interesting stuff after all. Sometimes that's what you want or need. But the implementation of these algorithmic feeds tended to overemphasize clickbait and engagement farms and reinforce what your perceived preferences, creating filter bubbles of the same kind of slop over and over. 

I remember when 9gag first became a thing. It was one of the earliest examples of websites I'd encountered that were just feeds of the same kinds of memes and nonsense you can scroll through endlessly. It can be amusing, but not the kind of web browsing I'd want to be doing all the time. And many modern web users (especially mobile users) got used to this sort of thing where the primary interaction they have with the web is scrolling through feeds of mostly the same kind of nonsense again and again.

It isn't the kind of "exploring" I am interested in.

When all these articles talk about the "death" or "destruction" of the web, they are talking about the modern commercial web: the web of advertising and clickbait and content farms and surveillance capitalism and websites trying to sell you things. And part of me thinks: maybe that's fine? Maybe we're better off if all of that goes away and all the grifters and scammers and capitalists move on to whatever AI platforms take over the commercial aspect? Also, maybe this sort of web "dying" will finally stop all those AI scraper bots trying to hoover up everything from our websites? One can only hope. (I honestly have little sympathy for the marketing industry as a whole.)

But that old web, the small web, the indie web, whatever you want to call it, it still exists, it will still exist! People haven't stopped making websites, people haven't stopped blogging earnestly (i.e. not just for ad views), they (we) are still out there! Posting away on our little web sites, not really caring that we don't get a lot of traffic (though [any support](https://ko-fi.com/roytang) is always nice of course!) and always happy to receive feedback and interact with any readers. And many of us still have RSS feeds you can follow, and despite the famous death of Google Reader, feed readers are alive and well and aplenty. There is still plenty of "web", the real web, to be explored. And I hope that remains true for a long time to come.
