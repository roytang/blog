New set is dropping on Arena next week, so I'm doing my recap for the previous set **Tarkir Dragonstorm**.

### Limited Summary / Notes

- I love formats like these where 5C is viable because I always enjoy drafting and playing midrange-y 5C decks and just picking up all the bombs I can play. For Dragonstorm in particular I ended up forcing 5C the vast majority of the time. I had a lot of fun, but also made many misplays and ended up with a terrible win rate, ending up below 50% overall.
- In general the best decks in the format were either 5C Dragons midrange with lots of orbs and dragons and dragonstorms, or low-to-the-ground go-wide Boros/Mardu aggro decks typically relying on the mobilize mechanic. You could play any of the regular draft archetypes, but frankly they were usually much worse than just going either value with 5C or hyper aggro with Mardu. 
- Despite losing so much I enjoyed the set and ended up playing 35 draft events total! This is my new record for most drafts played for an Arena set, breaking the previous record of 26 events in [Kamigawa Neon Dynasty](/2022/03/mtgneo-limited-recap/). Unfortunately it is also a record low winrate since [Lost Caverns of Ixalan](/2024/01/mtglci-set-recap/)!
- The stats below do tell me I should have focused more on Mardu aggro! I separated the 4c dragon variants in the stats, but in my head they are the same as the 5c ones basically.

### 7-x Draft Decks

If you check the last 2 4c dragons archetypes listed above, each of those corresponds to one of my 2 trophy decks! That's right, 35 drafts and only 2 trophies! Sigh, I should be better at this game!
