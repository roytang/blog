### The World

The US had some off-year elections last week, mostly local/state positions, and Democrats won big, including New York City's first Muslim mayor, Zohran Mandami. He reminds me a lot of London Mayor Sadiq Khan who coincidentally is also a Muslim mayor who has beefs with ThatGuy. ThatGuy of course, was quite mad about the election outcomes and rumor has it some of his associates are plotting to derail Mandami's term somehow.

Here on our side of the Pacific, we have been dealing with the a rainy season surge of typhoons. Visayas region was hit particularly bad by typhoon Tino earlier in the week, lots of flooding and pictures of cars piled up etc. All of this in stark contrast to no one being held accountable for the flood control corruption mess. And now today we are on day one of supertyphoon Uwan, an absolutely massive one showing up larger than the whole country on maps and satellite shots. Hopefully everyone gets through it okay. 

### My Week

- My own medical errands this week. Ever since the recent medical scare in our family, I've been a bit more anxious about any slight discomfort I feel or small deviation in lab results. Nothing seems too serious though.
- Other than that, kind of a chill week. And very unproductive, mostly because of Metaphor.
- On the blog: Wrote [the Movies/TV review post for Sep and Oct](/2025/11/movies-tv-sep-oct-2025/), [a short witty thing about outros](/2025/11/outro/), and [a review of the comic Invincible](/2025/11/invincible/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to keep up with newer releases. 
- Books: No new books started yet. Lol, I've had a couple sitting on my desk waiting to be read for weeks.

#### Watching

- Binged: **The Diplomat S3**
- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break), **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: *Blade (1998)* was on HBO Max, but the audio is terrible for some reason and there are no subs! I am only halfway through so I have not written a review yet.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: I think I am done with Omenpaths drafting now, as I am out of resources. Need to save up for the next set!
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Doing regular grinding, chapters and achievements.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Metaphor: ReFantazio**. This has really drawn me in and is eating up a lot of time!

#### Steam Deck Updates

So far, pretty sweet. Though I am still mostly playing the same old games, but now the Deck lets me play them in bed if I want lol. And I can occasionally dip into some smaller games that I wouldn't have bothered with before because I would need to go to the computer etc.

I really like that unlike a Nintendo Switch 2 or whatever, it's pretty much an open platform and you can install what you like. To that end, I also installed Magic Arena! Magic Arena is actually available on Steam, but not here in Southeast Asia where Tencent has the distribution rights. *Shakes fist at Tencent*. So I had to install the "rest of world" installer from the website and set it up. [This Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/uh0fg8/magic_the_gathering_arena_runs_flawlessly_on_the/) was helpful, though I had to make some adjustments. Took me a few tries to get it working, but now I am able to enjoy drafting in bed if I am too lazy to get up. 

Next up: At some point I wanna try installing and running emulators on the Deck! Also, will probably try to start a second longer game (to complement Metaphor) that I can just play cozily on the deck.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 64,554 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Pretty good. The weather has been not too bad on our side, though that is set to change with the supertyphoon; hopefully it leaves the PAR soon.

### Site Updates

- 2 new entries on [the link blog](/links/) (Boo!)
- 2 new entries under [the comics collection](/collections/comics/)
- Some typos corrected in last week's posts. Thanks to our astute readers for pointing them out!

### Looking Forward

Trivia team might be attending a quiz night this week! Other than that, some more medical stuff and follow-ups for me.
