*Metaphor: ReFantazio* is kind of a weird illegitimate child in the *Megami Tensei* bloodline. While it shares a lot of DNA with the series such as the Press Turn combat system of the main series and the calendar/time management and "social links" of the *Persona* subseries, it lacks the traditional demon-collecting mechanic that is so fundamental to the Megami Tensei series of games.

So *Metaphor: ReFantazio* is essentially a swords-and-sorcery Persona game, except without the Pokemon collection of the main series, which admittedly can get a bit tedious. 

Instead of Persona/demon summoning, the characters in MRF have *Archetypes*, basically the spirits of ancient heroes that act akin to Final Fantasy job classes. The equipped Archetype determines what combat abilities your character can have. You can change equipped Archetypes outside of combat and unlock new archetypes by finding new Followers ("Social Links"), and building up Follower ranks gives you various bonuses. It's a lot more tight and less redundant than the Persona-collecting from those other games, but at the same time less flexible, since you can't change Archetypes midcombat. It's easy to find yourself in a tough fight and find that you don't have the right loadout for a particular boss.

MRF also has a nice innovation to overworld combat that I really like. Similar to the Persona series, you can see enemies in the dungeon overworlds and can approach them and hit a button to start the turn-based "Squad Battles". Alternatively, you can attack enemies on the overworld directly! Dealing enough damage on the overworld means you start the Squad Battle with a significant advantage - the enemies take some damage and are stunned for the first round. And the best part is: if your level is significantly higher than the baddies, you don't even have to enter Squad Battles at all! You can just kill them on the overworld directly and when they die you still get money/experience/item drops, making grinding go A LOT faster! Enemies can also attack your protagonist on the overworld, and you have to be careful not to take hits because (a) you can die; and (b) you can be forced to enter a squad battle at a disadvantage!

Story-wise it's okay. The setting is very fantasy and the various plot twists were not especially surprising. Your party has some excellent characters though, and of course you have the opportunity to dig into their back stories via spending time with them and increasing their follower ranks. (I kept joking about the kingdom being in a crisis but I have to go spend some time with an orphan girl!) The majority of the story is actually an extended campaign trail: the previous king upon his death started a magical democracy process where whoever gathers the most support from the people after a certain amount of time will become king. Your primary rival in this process is like this right-wing demagogue who prizes strength over all else and some of his followers can be very hostile to nonbelievers; a lot of this hits very close to some real world problems!

The graphics of course are excellent, akin to recent Persona releases. And as is typical for games of its ilk, most of my screenshots are of dialog I found of interest.

#### Stats and Completion

Quoting [my Persona 5 review](/2017/06/review-persona-5-you-never-saw-it-coming/):

> One thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it's problematic for me.

The same is true for this game! I only managed 90% of all achievements completed.

Because I always worry about running out of time to complete Social Links in Persona games, I focused on the Follower Ranks in MRF. In the end, the 4 achievements I missed for completion are:

- complete all Gold Beetle exchanges (the ones I missed were mostly in nooks and crannies in the towns, but one of them was in a story area that I can no longer return to!)
- debate all opposing candidates (I did not think there would be an achievement for this! Maybe should have checked the list ahead of time?)
- defeat this secret superboss that's only available in New Game+
- collect all other achievements

I still had a save that would let me do the first one, but I'd have to grind through a significant portion of the game again. The rest require a second run in NG+. I'm not sure I have the heart or energy to do either of those, so I think I am putting this game down (for now at least).

My clear save has an in-game time of 81hrs, and I spent maybe an additional 2-3 hours afterwards cleaning up some achievements I missed. HLTB says "Main+Sides" runs average 87.5 hours, so that sounds about right. Full completion would have required I do an entire additional run (preferably on easy mode); HLTB says "Completionist" runs average 108 hours and I'm not really in the mood to do that. Mostly because I already spent too much time grinding out some of the achievements and in a few years Sega/Atlus is likely to release a definitive edition of this game which will annoy me and then I'd have to play it again anyway!

I played the game on PC Game Pass which I am considering unsubscribing from. I [ran a script](https://github.com/Z1ni/XGP-save-extractor) to export the save files for possible use in Steam later if I ever decide to get the game there.
