It is the 1st of December tomorrow which means 2025 is almost done. I will freely admit that I kind of checked out this year; the end of year roundup posts are gonna be a doozy to write.

### The World

The US (via his highness DJT) has unilaterally decided to close off Venezuelan airspace. I think it might be time for Americans to accept that the mask has been off for quite some time already and that the US government has revealed itself to be the bad guys many parts of the world have always accused them of being.

### My Week

- I had one of my routine scheduled checkups; I need a follow-up test and referral to another doctor this time, but should be no major concerns I hope.
- The week was mostly chill; enough that I had time to resume some of my archival side projects.
- Niece #1 celebrated her birthday a couple of days ago but we don't have time for a fam get-together anytime soon; instead she sent us a GCash QR Code so we could send her money!
- Trivia team have skipped out on the planned quiz night attendance; we are not likely to attend any more quiz nights for the rest of this year.
- On the blog: I wrote [the set recap for the MTG Spider-Man set](/2025/11/mtg-spiderman-om1/) and [a review of Metaphor:ReFantazio](/2025/11/metaphor/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Same same, not much new to report.
- I've been working hard on cutting down the feed reader backlog; I'm almost below 500 unread items again!

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break), **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: The only new movie I watched this week was [21 Jump Street](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/21-jump-street/). (I also saw the tail end of *Family Stone (2004)* as my parents were watching it. Seemed funny but not really my cup of tea.)

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Doing badly at the new set draft. I mentioned last week that the Steam Deck install was broken after the latest update, but thankfully it fixed itself after I re-ran the installer, so I did not have to do the troublesome delete and reinstall nonsense.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Mostly just keeping up with the weekly chapters. At some point I want to do all the achievements before the game dies off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Finished: **Metaphor: ReFantazio**! Review linked above.
    - Ongoing: **Children of Morta** on Steam. 

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 61,861 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Looks like I'm going to end the year with more than 200k steps than the previous year; it's probably hard to top that peak anyway!

### Site Updates

- 5 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)
- 2 new entries in the [albums collection](/collections/albums/) (just screenshot albums for some review posts)
- I found out that the web form for posting comments under posts was broken for an unknown amount of time. The form would have said the comment is submitted, but because I screwed up some backend scripts, it would never actually get to the database. The last comment via the web form was in early October so any comments submitted in the past 6-7 weeks is unfortunately lost to the aether. (Not that this site receives a lot of comments via the web form anyway.)

### Looking Forward

There's a bunch of blog posts I want to get done before the year ends, so hopefully we get there. 

New season of Fallout TV series is dropping this coming week I think.

December is a very bad month for going anywhere in Metro Manila due to increasingly bad traffic, but we do have a bunch of family get-togethers planned throughout the month. Plus I have some medical stuff to do this coming week.
