New set *Avatar: The Last Airbender* has been out for a while on Arena, so here's my overdue recap for the previous set **Marvel's Spider-Man / Through the Omenpaths**.

<!--more-->

Unlike other *Universes Beyond* sets, WOTC did **not** get the digital license for the Marvel sets, so this set (and presumably future Marvel ones) are in the odd situation that WOTC had to create one-to-one functional equivalents for every card in the set for use on Magic Arena and Magic Online, each one using MTG-multiverse art and creative. For Spider-Man, the equivalent set is "Through the Omenpaths". They even had to rename the "web-swinging" mechanic to "enweb"! I don't particularly care about the lore so this was fine for me, though it felt like a missed opportunity to play with some familiar characters given I'm a big Marvel fan.

### Limited Summary / Notes

- This set also uses the new "Pick 2" draft format designed to support 4-player pods. To that end, the set is smaller in size and only has half the number of draft archetypes. 
- "Premier Draft" was replaced with "Pick 2 Draft" which had slightly worse rewards and only went up to 5 wins. This was very weird and may throw off some of my stats below. Happily, when quick draft came back it had the old prize structure still, though it was also pick 2 draft.
- My experience with Pick 2 draft has not been great. It contradicts my rare-drafting tendencies, because the better cards in packs tend to be scooped up pretty quickly, and it often feels like you have to commit early to colors before having that many cards. Add to that the fact that there were only 5 draft archetypes, and they were not particularly well-balanced either. The bant colors were often much stronger than any red-based ones for example. All in all a very difficult set for me, as evident in my win rate.
- I did like how a lot of the mechanics played though. Mayhem was a good fix for the rules nightmare that is madness. Enweb / web-slinging letting you reset abilities might have been too good I guess.
- I say that red was less balanced, but towards the end of the season when I decided to try playing more red decks I did well with some Gruul ones. I think the one archetype I never got to work properly was the villains one? I suspect one of the reasons my win rate was so bad in this set was that although WG and WU were the objectively better archetypes, my personal play-style favored RB or RG more even though those decks were often a bit worse.
- As is typical with UB sets, this set had a higher than normal count of legendaries, and early in the season I wasn't really paying attention and drafted a 4-of common that was legendary. Oops.

### Constructed Notes

I believe I still got to Mythic rank in constructed in October, mostly due to playing the Izzet Vivi deck before it got banned/nerfed. I've also been playing Show and Tell in Timeless, very fun and skill-testing especially with Strip Mine now in the format.

### Next

I have already been drafting the new *Avatar* set, and it feels much better than Spider-Man already, though I am still struggling! Hopefully I can get better win rates once Quick Draft rolls around.
