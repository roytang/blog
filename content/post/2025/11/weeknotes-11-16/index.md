How is the month already halfway done?!?

### The World

Last weekend's typhoon was thankfully not as bad as it could have been, and left the country late Monday. I think the previous typhoon that mostly hit the Visayas region was much more devastating.

Marking a true "end of an era" in Philippine politics, Juan Ponce Enrile has passed away at the age of 101. 

US government shutdown has finally ended; moderate Democrats caved and basically gained nothing. Also, more Epstein information has been released, and the House is due to vote on releasing even more files now that the shutdown is ever. Not that I am convinced that will be enough to make ThatGuy's base abandon him. Fanaticism can make people justify anything.

### My Week

- Some follow-up medical stuff for me, need to go back again this coming week.
- Trivia team [attended a quiz night last Thursday and did poorly](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-panget/).
- At least I am starting to regain some productive time, managed to get some of my pending side project work done.
- On the blog: No extra blog posts this week.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Same same, nothing new to report.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break), **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: Watched 4 movies this week! [Blade (1998)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/blade/), [Blade II (2002)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/blade-ii/), [Blade Trinity (2004)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/blade-trinity/), [A House of Dynamite (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/a-house-of-dynamite/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Saving up and waiting for the next set.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Kind of irregular on the grinding here.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Metaphor: ReFantazio** still eating up a lot of time! Am close to finishing the main story; not yet sure if I'm going for completion on this one.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 60,716 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Pretty good. I'm just happy to have hit 60k this week. The first few days were very rainy and windy, while during the last couple of days I had to stay around at home for most of them, so it was good I was still able to find time to walk!

### Site Updates

- 4 new entries on [the link blog](/links/) (Boo!)
- 1 new entries under [the albums collection](/collections/albums/)
    - The new entry is [a gallery of my desktop wallpapers on rotation](/collections/albums/wallpapers/).
- 1 new entry under [the quiz nights log](/collections/quiznights/) (linked above)

The feed reader backlog remains a challenge to keep down.

### Looking Forward

- Trivia team hopes to attend yet another quiz night this week, and maybe do better.
- New set should be dropping on Arena in the middle of the week!
- Some medical follow-ups for me.
