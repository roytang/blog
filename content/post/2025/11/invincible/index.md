*Invincible* was an Image-published superhero comic created and written by Robert Kirkman. It ran from 2003 to 2018 with 144 issues. I was reading this as it came out back in the day but I think my interest waned a bit around halfway through the series and I stopped following it. After watching [the third season of the animated Prime Video adaptation](/2025/04/movies-tv-1q/#invincible-s3) earlier this year, I recently binge-read the entire second half of the series (and then some), so I thought I'd write about it!

If you've seen the recent show, it's a pretty faithful adaptation so you have an idea about the premise: In a world full of superheroes, Mark Grayson is the son of Omni-Man, the world's strongest superhero, and when he gains similar powers he becomes a superhero himself, taking on the mantle of Invincible. But then he finds out his father's dark secret: his father is actually from an alien race called the Viltrumite Empire bent on galactic domination and he was sent here to subjugate Earth! Thus begins Marks adventures dealing with teenager problems, superhero problems, and alien invasion problems!

When I started reading the book, it felt kind of like the usual edgy alterate "Superman" story that was kind of in vogue at the time. Now having read the entire run, I am very impressed. Invincible feels like a distillation of superhero comics at their purest, unburdened by legacy or editorial constraints. You have the colorful costumes, the ridiculous names (my favorite: Dupli-Kate and her brother Multi-Paul), the criminal masterminds, the mad scientists, the giant kaiju, the alternate dimensions, time travel, alien invasions, humans being selfish idiots, betrayals, redemptions, and so on and so forth. All of it often punctuated by brutal, unforgiving action sequences that often result in character deaths and surprising status quo changes. Invincible takes big swings and is not afraid to hit the characters where they hurt, but in the end Mark still somehow manages to resolve everything and eke out a happy ending for most everyone.

Later in the series, the issue covers started carrying the tagline "The Best Superhero Comic In The Universe" (and sometimes they even struck out the "Superhero") and it might be a bit of an exaggeration but honestly if this book makes it on some such lists I would not be surprised. I like it more than *The Walking Dead*, Kirkman's other well-known ongoing series of around the same period, maybe because I'm just not that big a fan of the zombie apocalypse genre because they always seem to have little to no interest in actually resolving the apocalypse. Maybe someday I'll review that too!
