### Movies

Not a lot of movies during this period, though I still have soooo many on my "want to watch" list.

#### Sinners (2025)

 *This review may contain spoilers.*

 I did not know coming in there would be vampires lol. Now I have to mark this as containing spoilers! I thought it would be about being black and religious in a certain era, and it was about that. But also vampires. It was very good.

 The story isn't big on originality, striking almost exactly the same notes as the earlier films, but it's a cozy, comfortable formula and the film hits the right notes and taps the right amount of nostalgia while bringing yet another young prodigy into the tree. This film has a lot more pizza though, and I approve. 

Fun cameo at the end that Barney would approve of. When are we getting Jaden to reprise though?

 Started out a bit slow with lots of talky parts, but once it got going it was very good. Excellent performances all around.

 Hey, a Filipino film! I went downstairs and they had just started this film on NF so I ended up watching the whole thing. It was surprisingly entertaining. I can't speak towards how good Geisler's autistic portrayal was, but I found his facial expressions amusing, especially knowing how the actor is IRL. The action was pretty good though, especially given how he's almost never looking directly at all the bad guys he's fighting. And the ending was much less predictable than I thought it would be.

I feel like this is the sort of film that could be adapted into a Statham action movie (though probably Statham would have a much less exaggerated portrayal)

#### The Matrix Resurrections (2021)

Watched on 2025-10-31: ★★★½



{{% photos the-matrix-resurrections-2021 %}}

 I can appreciate all the callbacks (and reused footage!) from the original trilogy, and also all the meta commentary about the modern media landscape and actually creating a 4th Matrix film. The second half feels a lot more vapid than the first for some reason, and there's a lot of technical mumbo jumbo nonsense thrown in there as they try to accomplish their objective.

I'm kind of glad this movie tanked, which raises the question of whether this legacy sequel needed to be created at all. Of course it didn't, but capitalism gotta capitalism. Neo and Trinity's story was done and for all we knew peace reigned in their world after the end of the original trilogy. Did we really need to know how it all turned out and what new conflict arose later on? We are a bit like Neo and Trinity, brought back against their will, in the pursuit of making the lines go up.

That being said, the kung fu action was still fairly good, and the movie was fairly entertaining on its own, though the third act plot was a bit confusing.

### TV

#### Poker Face

Finished watching on 2025-09-14: ★★★★½

(2 seasons)

I think this was my first time ever watching a ["howcatchem"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_detective_story) type of murder mystery procedural --- where the audience is told/shown ahead of time who the culprit is in each episode, and the storytelling revolves around how the protagonist is able to suss them out. Took me a few episodes to get used to this style, but I warmed up to it.

The show is a very "cozy" murder mystery show, and Natasha Lyonne's Charlie Cale is a charming yet unlucky vagabond who travels from place to place accidentally ending up getting involved in and solving each murder of the week thanks to both an innate ability to detect "bullshit" (as she calls it) and the impeccable urge to help people out. There are lots of big name celebrity cameos, and Howard from TBBT even has a recurring role! 

I think creator Rian Johnson has said that there are currently no plans for a third season, which is a shame. I am a bit saddened by how badly life has gone for Charlie Cale and it would have been nice to see things actually turn out better for her.

#### Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3

Finished watching on 2025-09-14: ★★★

A noticable drop in quality from the first two seasons, mostly because of too much hijinx. It's a bit of a problem with the newer generation of shows like this one that only get around 10 episodes a season; you only have so much room for all the shenanigans that a 20+ episode season would have afforded back in the day. "Four and a Half Vulcans" may have just been a tad too far for the series' tone and a series low; this isn't *Lower Decks* after all. 

The highlight of this season was "Terrarium", the episode focused on Ortegas that helps her overcome her trauma over the Gorn. The season's overarching plot involves a diabolical alien race imprisoned by an ancient civilization that they have to prevent from escaping and overwhelming the universe. The cast ends up sacrificing one of their loved ones to end the threat.

#### Dandadan S2

Finished watching on 2025-09-21: ★★★★

I like how the anime closely hews to the source material, because it means I know what to expect most of the time, and am always glad to see how it all turns out animated. There is still a bit of a cliffhanger at the season end, but not as bad as the one at the end of S1.

#### Young Sheldon

Finished watching on 2025-09-28: ★★★★

(7 seasons)

Despite its faults, I loved *The Big Bang Theory*, and *Young Sheldon* gives us a great peak into the main character's childhood growing up in Texas under conditions not exactly ideal for a budding future-Nobel-winning prodigy. YS is less of a "laugh track" kind of sitcom than TBBT, tending more towards absurd situations and Southern family life than straight out laughs. It's a cozy show that was good for second screen watching, which meant I was able to binge through it pretty quickly.

I was super impressed with the casting like how much Montana Jordan (playing Sheldon's older brother Georgie) looks like Jerry O'Connell (who played the older Georgie in TBBT); but it later turns out that Jerry O'Connell was introduced to TBBT after YS had already started airing, so the resemblance was probably cast in reverse! I do have some trouble imagining Iain Armitage growing up to look like Jim Parsons though.

#### Sakamoto Days S2

Finished watching on 2025-10-05: ★★★★

I'm still a bit iffy on the animation here, but they are getting started on the fun JCC storyline which is where I started the manga, so we are at least getting more interesting fights.

#### Peacemaker S2

Finished watching on 2025-10-12: ★★★★

I think I prefer the intro dance sequence in S1 prefer the intro song in S2. S2 of the show takes us to the DC multiverse! They retconned the end of season 1 so that this season now references the recent Superman film. Cena does a bit more acting here as Peacemaker finds himself at odds with his life and is seduced by what what is later revealed to be the Nazi-ruled Earth X. Adrian Chase/Vigilante and Tim Meadows' Fleury were great lol. The season was okay (and very much still not for kids), except the final episode felt stretched to much to accomodate some musical acts and set up for future DC stories such as the Superman sequel. Peacemaker almost gets a happy ending, but gets the rug pulled out from under him as he has to suffer for his sins in *The Suicide Squad*.

#### Eyes of Wakanda

Finished watching on 2025-10-19: ★★★★

This miniseries was done in a gorgeous handpainted style and follows the adventures of Wakandan undercover agents through history (in the Sacred Timeline) trying to recover stolen Wakandan artifacts. It's very fun, and even manages to sneak in some references to the wider superhero world and the final episode also ties in to the storyline of *Black Panther*.

#### Marvel Zombies

Finished watching on 2025-10-26: ★★★

This miniseries spins out of that one "What If?" episode. The problem with "What If?" has always been with only one episode per world you only glimpse small parts of it and there's really no room to flesh it out. Having four episodes to expand on the previous Marvel Zombies episode means we get to see how the rest of the world is dealing with the zombie apocalypse, and we get to see much more of the very wide MCU cast in action (not all of them as good guys!)

This one was beautifully animated in the "What If?" style, but WTH was that ending! Well, to be fair this might be typical of "zombie apocalypse"-type stories that they basically almost never have good endings for our protags, but the rug pull on that last bit of hope at the end was a bit much for me. And there's still no explanation why Kamala was so important?!?

#### Only Murders in the Building S5

Finished watching on 2025-11-02: ★★★

It's more of the same, still very cozy and occasionally funny. Good for second screen watching. My favorite characters this season were those Italian brothers (Tea Leoni's kids), they're so dumb lol. And apparently they are still somehow doing a season six.
