These weeknotes are coming in a day late because I had a busy weekend. Frankly it's a miracle I haven't missed one of these for (checks the archive) almost 5 years now!

### The World

Trump has signed a bipartisan bill demanding the release of the Epstein files. Who knows if that actually happens or if he actually faces consequences for his participation in Epstein's schemes?

The US has put forward a proposed Ukraine peace plan that is apparently tantamount to capitulating to Russia.

### My Week

- Had a very busy and exhusting week, mostly due to hospital errands; both routine tests for Patient #1 and having to accompany a relative to the ER.
    - During one of her testing days when we had to go to hospital, Patient #1 woke up with a mysterious pain in her leg that kept her from walking. I ended up borrowing a wheelchair from our nearby relatives so that we can bring it with us. I learned that pushing a wheelchaired person around for a few hours is no easy task!
    - We're not at the hospital nearly as often as we were in 2024, so I kind of am no longer used to how long these tasks take. Whenever we go to hospital for tests or procedures or consultations or whatnot, these things always take a bit longer than I expect, no matter how pessimistic I am!
- On top of that, our part-time helper had to take a couple of weeks off, so I needed to help with more household chores than usual.
- We're always complaining that we never get to avail of the QC local government giveaways, but this past weekend we were able to claim their Christmas giveaway! (One per household.)

- Trivia team skipped out on the planned quiz night attendance.
- On the blog: No extra blog posts this week.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Same same, not much new to report. I've been doing a run of Punisher comics on Marvel Unlimited and was really annoyed when I found out that a good 40% of his first ongoing series from the 80s is missing from the service! I had to resort to "other means" of getting to read the missing issues!

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Superman The Animated Series**, **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break), **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: Watched 2 movies this week: [The Working Man (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/a-working-man/) and [The Theory of Everything (2014)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-theory-of-everything-2014/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Have already drafted the new Avatar set a few times. Fun format, but I am not doing particularly well.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Kind of faded away. Hopefully can get back to it at some point.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Metaphor: ReFantazio** very close to the end! Doing some end-game grinding for achievement purposes first.
    - Started: **Children of Morta** on Steam. See below.

#### Steam Deck Updates

Happy to report that I was able to take the Steam Deck out a couple of times this week during some of the medical errands. This was one of my goals: to be able to play my Steam backlog on the go, especially when I have to be waiting around hospitals and clinics. Unfortunately, the Steam Deck is a bit too big for [my regular sling bag](/2023/11/everyday-carry/) so instead I had to bring my pretty big backpack to carry it around. I should have some kind of in-between solution at some point.

The game I was playing during these excursions was **Children of Morta** on Steam, a hack-and-slash roguelike I've had in my library for a while. I think the Steam Deck is great for this kind of smaller games where you can just do a short run in a few minutes or so and not lose too much from putting the device to sleep.

One of the first things I tried when I got the Steam Deck was installing Magic Arena. This went well, but then after some recent updates the "sideloaded" installation stopped working, and I had to reinstall the game to get it working again. Then last night I found my Steam Deck install wasn't working again. This is NOT sustainable! One of the reasons I wanted a Steam Deck was as a trial run to test how feasible it would be to switch away from Windows eventually and still pursue my gaming habits, and this is kind of a blocker! All this because of the silly Tencent licensing deal in Asia!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 63,517 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I managed to hit 10k every day of the week til Friday, but Saturday was a wash because there was so much stuff to do. At this point I am almost certainly going to be short of last year's total by end of the year. I keep telling myself it's fine!

### Site Updates

- Nothing this past week! So busy.

### Looking Forward

One last week in November! Niece #1 will be celebrating her birthday this week, but I don't think we have time for a fam get-together soon, though we have a lot planned for the second half of December.
