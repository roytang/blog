A few days ago, someone in our household passed away. In the past couple of months of [weeknotes](/blog/tags/weeknotes/) I have referred to her as "Patient#3" to avoid disclosing personal details. She is not a relative, but she has been working and living with our family for the better part of 30 years (estimated), so we pretty much grew up wtih her around the household, making her practically family. Needless to say she will be missed.

The disease came at her rapidly over the past few months, but her passing came as no surprise as she had surrendered to the disease a couple of weeks ago. When numerous consultations with doctors made it clear any treatment was only going to be palliative and not curative and that she wasn't even in any condition to travel home to the province, she refused further rounds of chemo. 

I am no stranger to death, but it has never felt this close before. Living under the same roof with someone who was essentially just waiting to die. It was an uneasy feeling for all of us I think, especially for her relatives staying with us to help with the care. There was a mixture of guilt and frustration over the feeling that one needs to be doing something; there was the discomfort whenever we could hear her moaning despite the meds intended to ease her pains; there was the not knowing when the ordeal would end and the anxiety that came with it. My every instinct is always to fight as much as possible, and it was difficult to reconcile that with our helplessness.

We spoke to her oncologist shortly after she refused treatment and she advised us to respect and accept the wishes of the patient. She advised us not to feel guilty given that we cannot do anything against the natural course of the disease. 

We had a priest come by to perform the Annointing of the Sick and I was a bit uneasy over this as well, as it felt like a major sign that we were giving up. He told us about other similar cases he encountered and advised us to just make sure the patient was as comfortable as possible.

When she passed I was the first one her carers told. I went downstairs to confirm it myself. The pulse oximeter could not get a reading. This was my first time I came in direct contact with someone who has passed.

From there, I was amazed at how rapidly things proceeded. My parents had already spoken beforehand to a funeral service; after all we had been helplessly waiting and all we could do was prepare for the inevitable. Within the day someone had arrived to talk to us and take the body for cremation. We prayed over her body before they took her away.

In the country there is a lot of superstition about death. My dad was worried about someone passing away in the house, as it might bring bad luck (or a haunting?) We had to get rid of the mattress and blanket she passed away in. 

We had a small service at the church and after we got the urn with the ashes, they held a small "wake", inviting her friends from the neighborhood. I did not join in as I felt uneasy talking to strangers about all of this.

Earlier today, they flew her remains home to the province where her family will hold a proper wake. May she rest in peace.

I have been undecided as to whether I should write about her passing in this space, as I tend to avoid talking too much about other people's personal lives on the blog. But it felt weird to not mention it, or only in passing in the weeknotes. It seems like an event I should note, and I might not be able to move on until I write down my thoughts.

The past few days for me were a mixture of sadness, listlessness and relief that her ordeal (and ours) was now over. We all know that death is an inevitable part of life, but it still hits you hard when it happens. Ever since my parents got Covid three years ago I have been dreading the time when I would need to handle this kind of situation; this was kind a preview for something I may have to face again a few years down the line (hopefully more years than I expect!). Just another reminder to appreciate the time we have with the people in our lives while we still have them with us.
