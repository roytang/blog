title: Consuming the News
---

I was a bit young when I started consuming news regularly. I chalk this up to my dad, who was always reading the morning newspaper at the breakfast table, a kind of bad habit he still keeps to this day. (I sometimes joke that he is one of the few remaining people keeping the dying print news industry alive). At first I started out reading only the daily comic strips, but soon also began reading tech and business sections, and soon even the front page politics stuff and at some point I got familiar with the usual names on the editorial pages.

This was back before the day of the 24 hour news cycle. Back then you'd read the newspaper in the morning and maybe catch an evening news broadcast, and that's all the news you'd be exposed to for the day. Sometimes there would be breaking news alerts, but those would be incredibly rare. At the time, there was simply not enough news being produced.

Those days are long gone. These days news outlets are available online 24/7 constantly updating throughout the day and if you're always doomscrolling on social media, you're always seeing a lot of "breaking news" or "in case you missed it" articles, many of them rehashing stories from earlier in the day. All of this is a consequence of the ever-expanding advertising industry, demanding a constant stream of views and eyeballs for an increasingly small share of the advertisers' dollar.

It can easily get overwhelming.

A while back I read a thread on Mastodon (now apparently already deleted, not even a month later. I really should just archive things immediately) about how for your own mental health, you should consider unsubscribing from all these news outlets. This resonated with me (and I wish the poster had not deleted the thread).

I got turned off from following the local news too closely after getting burnout from local politics. I was eagerly following and consuming the 24 hour news cycle during the 2016 elections and to a lesser extent the 2019 midterms and the 2022 elections, but all I got from that was a strong disillusionment over how many terrible decisions the local electorate was making. This year we have another midterm elections coming up and there are still a lot of politics-related shenanigans happening locally, but I am barely paying attention. I rarely read the morning newspaper anymore except every so often to skim the headlines, and I really only watch news broadcasts when I'm downstairs eating and someone else is watching. 

The other day on Chinese New Year, a taxi driver was telling us about a fire that happened in the Ongpin area the previous night, and we had not heard about on the news or anything like that, and the driver said he read about in on Facebook. I still shudder a bit at how Facebook is how many Filipinos consume their news nowadays. That is even less healthy.

I actually follow international news a bit more closely, often via the Flipboard app at meals. (I almost [said goodbye to Flipboard](/2021/01/goodbye-flipboard/) completely in 2019 after being so annoyed at how crashy the iPad app was, but have since migrated to reading it via Android.) The news, primarily from the US, can still be infuriating, but because I am several layers detached (not being an American) it is a bit more tolerable. 

There's a good argument to be made for carefully managing your news intake on the internet and social media.

Alan Jacobs tells us that [we don't have to be there](https://blog.ayjay.org/you-dont-have-to-be-there/), citing an example about the LA wildfires:

> People: you don’t have to “watch the destruction in Los Angeles through the prism of our fractured social-media ecosystem.” Nobody is making you. And it doesn’t do you any good to watch. 

He reads the news even less often than I do, only once a week, and advocates following writers and sites via an RSS reader instead (a recommendation I wholeheartedly second!)

Doomscrolling is a habit we should all be working to minimize, if not eliminate completely. 404 Media reminds us that [we can't post our way out of fascism](https://www.404media.co/email/34326692-bdfe-4a3c-a1e3-4f9d84956d02/). People being stuck on their phones doomscrolling over the latest outrage is something fascists want:

> Thinkers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Hannah Arendt warned us that the point of this deluge is not to persuade, but to overwhelm and paralyze our capacity to act. More recently, researchers have found that the viral outrage disseminated on social media in response to these ridiculous claims actually reduces the effectiveness of collective action. The result is a media environment that keeps us in a state of debilitating fear and anger, endlessly reacting to our oppressors instead of organizing against them. 

...

> “For most people, social media gives you this sense that unless you care about everything, you care about nothing. You must try to swallow the world while it’s on fire,” said Cross. “But we didn’t evolve to be able to absorb this much info. It makes you devalue the work you can do in your community.”
> 
> It’s not that social media is fundamentally evil or bereft of any good qualities. Some of my best post-Twitter moments have been spent goofing around with mutuals on Bluesky, or waxing romantic about the joys of human creativity and art-making in an increasingly AI-infested world. But when it comes to addressing the problems we face, no amount of posting or passive info consumption is going to substitute the hard, unsexy work of organizing.

I don't think we need to detach ourselves from the news about this burning world completely. Apathy is not a solution. But when the fascists of the world are trying to overwhelm us with executive orders, constantly reading and worrying about the bad news doesn't help. You are basically just doing a DDOS on yourself. In this modern media landscape, managing your news consumption is not just good for your mental health, it's also an act of resistance.
