### My Week

Last Friday was the 101st birthday of local politician / lich king Juan Ponce Enrile. I joked about what if Enrile is our universe's anchor being, and if/when he dies, that is the sign that things are about to end?

Patient #3 update: we are still just waiting, as the condition slowly deteriorates. It sucks.

I did have more time this week to get on with my personal projects and do a good bit of decluttering in my room. Still a ways to go though.

I even managed to take the time out to hang out at the mall with my brother to watch a new MCU movie. IMAX movie ticket prices are up around 20-40% since 2023, which goes a long way towards explaining why many people don't really go to the cinema anymore.

Last week when Microsoft tried to renew my Game Pass subscription, they somehow charged me EIGHT TIMES for the same month, and then didn't even register that as successfully charging me. So now I have my first-ever ongoing Paypal Dispute; the status is currently "awaiting a response from Microsoft". The subscription successfully renewed after I switched to a credit card.

On the blog this week: just [the game review for Citizen Sleeper 2](/2025/02/citizen-sleeper-2/).

### Media Diet

**Reading**: Still mostly just comics recently, **Wind and Truth** moving along very slowly. 

**Watching**: Still trying to keep up with **Dragon Ball Daima**, **Sakamoto Days**, **Pantheon**, **Invincible S3**. Also caught up with **Abbott Elementary**. And I managed to watch a couple of movies this week! [The Holdovers (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-holdovers/) and [Captain America: Brave New World (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/captain-america-brave-new-world/).

**Gaming**: Still mostly just trying to keep up with **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game**. I finished [Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector](/2025/02/citizen-sleeper-2/)! Started playing **Dungeons of Hinterberg**! I added this to my Steam wishlist a couple of weeks back, but then found out this week it was actually on Game Pass.

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 64,984 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I hit the 10k target every day from Sunday to Friday, then circumstances and laziness meant I didn't get to walk a lot on Saturday but honestly that's already pretty good. I'd love to be able to hit 70k every week, but even God had to rest on the 7th day, so I think I can forgive myself for this one.

    > Before they became walled gardens, social networks were great places for discovery, and although posts with links don’t get the visibility they used to on the bigger platforms, you shouldn’t be blogging or socializing for scale anyway. Defy Big Social and share those links to your own posts, and to posts you’ve enjoyed. Blogs only die when they’re abandoned by their owners.

    > Why keep blogging? Because the internet isn’t a walled garden, and it’s incomplete without your voice.

- [Why Blog If Nobody Reads It? | Andy's Blog](https://andysblog.uk/why-blog-if-nobody-reads-it/)

    > Blogging forces clarity. It makes you structure your thoughts, sharpen your perspective. You stop writing fluff because — let’s be honest — you’re writing for yourself. And if you can’t keep yourself interested, nobody else stands a chance.

    > When you write, you think better. When you think better, you create better.

- [Outgrowing Friendships | Notes by JCProbably](https://notes.jeddacp.com/outgrowing-friendships/)

    > Looking back at all these different kinds of friendship, I now understand that there’s no need for guilt in outgrowing these friendships. We don’t typically shame ourselves for outgrowing old clothes2 or hobbies, so why should this be any different? People change, our priorities shift, and sometimes the space we once fit together just isn’t the same anymore.

    I wish things lasted forever, including friendships.

    Following a notification spam attack, Codeberg writes an excellent mea culpa, post-mortem and affirmation of their commitment to tolerance and equal rights:

    > We will not be discouraged in our fight against far-right ideologies. They are currently on the rise in many parts of the world, and we believe it is important to protect all kinds of marginalized groups. However, if you believe this does not affect your project, you are wrong. Far-right forces pose a threat to all of us.
