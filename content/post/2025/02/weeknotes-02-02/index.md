### The World

It's been weird on social media (mostly Masto and Reddit) over the past few week, since my follows are mostly American and left-leaning, so there is a lot of doom and gloom over Trump/Musk's actions. I still feel kind of detached from the larger world's problems (because we have our own smaller local household problems to worry about) but I wish our American resistance friends the best, especially since their problems tend to affect the rest of us as well.

### My Week

Patient#3 had two chemo sessions this week. I was worried about the logistics behind bringing her to the hospital and everything (so many things could have gone wrong), but surprisingly everything worked out somehow. Still, each session took the entire day and was very draining. And her condition hasn't really improved that much. She wants to go home to the province already, but her condition makes flying her there extremely difficult. We had some teleconsults yesterday that basically confirmed we are in palliative care mode and not much further improvement can be expected, so we are kind of not sure how to move forward. Frankly I suspect we are nearing the end, though I don't see any way it can be a happy ending. We will do our best.

Honestly the medical stuff took most of my time and energy this week, though I am still managing to inch forward on other more personal goals.

Despite all that, we managed to get together with family last Wednesday for the Chinese New Year holiday and also to celebrate some late January/early Feb birthdays. We had an incident with **Modern Shang** giving us terrible service so we ended up migrating to **Shakey's** for a smaller second lunch, which made for a weird and kinda memorable celebration I guess.

My only other blog post this week was about the recent [Gaiman](/2025/01/gaiman/) allegations.

### New Feed Reader

For the past 4 years or so I've been a satisfied subscriber to [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) as my feed reader of choice. While I am generally happy with their service, I am looking for ways to save some money so I decided to end that subscription. Unfortunately, their free tier doesn't allow me to follow enough feeds, so I started looking for an alternative. Over the past couple of weeks, I've been trying to set up a self-hosted instance of [FreshRSS](https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS) instead. Took me a few tries because I didn't realize at first that my PHP version on the server was older than what was required, but I eventually got there. Will see if this one sticks.

### Media Diet

**Reading**: Still mostly just comics recently, my non-comic book reading has stalled. **Wind and Truth** moving along very slowly.

**Watching**: Still trying to keep up with **Dragon Ball Daima** and **Sakamoto Days**, both via Netflix. Started watching **What If Season 3** on Disney+ and **The Penguin** on Max. No new movies watched this week.

**Gaming**: Still mostly just trying to keep up with **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game**. In a bid to get some single-player gaming in and to trim the Steam backlog a little bit, I decided to try to finish a platformer from more than a decade ago: **Ducktales Remastered**! It is not a very long game, but my platforming skills aren't what they used to be so I am restarting stages a lot. I am still trying to finish the final escape sequence! Also, a pleasant surprise: **Citizen Sleeper 2** is out on PC Game Pass! Once I get my Ducktales done, I might try to squeeze that one in before Civ7/Avowed take over my gaming time later this month.

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 55,007 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). This is only a bit more than last week, but we will get to our 70k target eventually.
