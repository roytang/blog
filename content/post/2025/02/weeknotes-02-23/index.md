Wow, another month is about to end.

### My Week

[Patient #3's ordeal has come to an end](/2025/02/inevitable/). Time to try to move on. Losing a household member means increased household chore load for everyone though, at least temporarily until we can figure stuff out.

PayPal has managed to refund me for TWO of the EIGHT extra Game Pass charges; apparently I was supposed to file a dispute for each of the charges, so I did that afterwards and we'll see what happens after that.

On the blog this week: I [did a set recap for the previous MTG set](/2025/02/mtg-foundations/) and [wrote about Patient #3](/2025/02/inevitable/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Still mostly just comics recently, lots of Spider-Man stuff, but also trying to catch up on everything else. **Wind and Truth** still moving along very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Dragon Ball Daima**, **Sakamoto Days**, **Invincible S3**, **Abbott Elementary**. 
- Started this week: **High Potential** (via Disney+)
- Finished this week: **Pantheon S1**. I enjoyed it and S2 just dropped, but I'm not sure I'm in the mood for more of it.
- Watched some movies this weekend: [Despicable Me 4 (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/despicable-me-4/), [Terminator: Dark Fate (2019)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/terminator-dark-fate/), and [Kingdom of Heaven (2005)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/kingdom-of-heaven/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every so often. 
    - I have run a few Aetherdrift drafts on Magic Arena and my win rate so far is decent, but a trophy remains elusive.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Dungeons of Hinterberg**. I am very close to finishing the game, just need to decide whether I want to bother grinding out completion. I expect to write the review this week.
- Started: **Avowed**. Didn't get too far past the character creator, just wanted to make sure the PC had no trouble with it. Will wait for Hinterberg to be done before digging in.
- Tried: **Fatal Fury: City of Wolves** Open Beta. This game looks great, but I don't think I should spend money on yet another fighting game I'll be bad at and not really have time to play.

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 65,376 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), a slight increase over last week's total. I still wish I could get back to 70k, but that's pretty good all things considered. My skipped day was in the middle of the week when things happened.

    > Deresiewicz used to think “selling out”—using the most sacred parts of your life and values to shill for a brand—was “evil.” Yet this economy has made it so there’s “no choice” if you want a living. The very concept of selling out, he says, “has disappeared.”

How much longer will the charade hold that these so-called leaders have our best interests at heart and not their own? The curtain has fallen and the true nature of the wizard revealed. We just need to believe it.
