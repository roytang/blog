I think I read about **Dungeons of Hinterberg** from some article about underrated PC games, so when I saw it was on PC Game Pass I decided to give it a try. It started out a bit slow for me at first, as the dungeon-crawling didn't seem much to write about and the character designs were a bit funky to say the least, but it quickly grew on me, especially once I found out the game had Persona-style time management and "social links" to build up.

The game is a dungeon crawler set in a version of our modern world where somehow magic has manifested in select spots. Magic manifests in the form of portals to dungeons and monsters in remote towns and villages. Local communities and industries quickly sprung out to support "slaying" as a form of tourism - people come from all over to visit these areas and fight monsters and clear dungeons. Top "slayers" become famous celebrities and influencers, further fueling this new industry.

Our protagonist Luisa used to work at a law firm in Vienna and needed to get away from the rat race and figure out her life and found herself in the village of Hinterberg, famous for a set of 25 dungeons that has changed the village's economy since they appeared 3 years ago.

The gameplay loop is simple: Each day Luise can go to one of Hinterberg's outlying areas and seek out dungeons to explore. Each area grants the slayer with a pair of magic "skills" that are typically helpful both in combat and traversing the world. Exploring a dungeon takes most of the day. In the evening, Luise can choose to hang out with various people in town or engage in other activities, forming relationships similar to Persona's social links. Building up relationships gives you perks that help you out with your dungeon crawling.

The dungeons themselves are mostly interlocking series of puzzles and monster battles. The battles are real-time and third-person and not especially difficult. Luisa wields a sword and can also unlock special attacks and such. 

There is an overarching plot that proceeds as you complete more and more dungeons; it will not surprise you that human greed is the main villain here, so I'm not afraid to spoil that. And there is a set of urgency as the plot progresses, and Luisa herself will remind you that you need to complete all the dungeons as soon as you can. But that is only a story deadline; the game itself will allow you to spend as many days as you want goofing off and doing various things needed for completion. 

I think I could have finished the game by completing all the dungeons around day 40 or so, but kept putting it off so I can grind out achievement completion and finally finished the game on day 62. I had to backtrack a few dungeons to get missed commemorative coins, then spent extra days grinding out money, magic elements, monster parts etc. By the end of it I was so overpowered the final boss didn't really give me any trouble.

Completion stats:

- Playtime: 25.9; HLTB says completion runs take around 24h, so I didn't waste **too* much time.
- Finished at Day 62.
- Achievements: 1275/1275. 
- Played from Feb 14 to Feb 25.

Overall a very cozy game, not too stressful, though some of those quests/achievements could have been less grindy. I do wish the character designs were a bit less goofy-looking but that's more a matter of style than a knock on the game. Happy to have played it!
