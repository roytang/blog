Previously: [Citizen Sleeper](/2023/01/citizen-sleeper/)

I played the first game just over 2 years ago via Game Pass as well! It was one of the first games I played on Game Pass I believe.

*Starward Vector* is a harder game than the first one - there are new mechanics like stress and dice damage that you have to manage. It's also much less on-rails: after a certain point you get to travel around the belt on your ship (as resources allow) and choose where to go next and what missions to do. You can take on contracts which are like missions where you have limited resources and usually limited time, and the new mechanics can make those contracts very challenging - I finished a couple just barely surviving through them, and failed at least one.

Other than that, the game is mostly the same. You wander around trying to escape your fate and help people and there is a cat again and some characters from the first game make another appearance. The plot feels more expansive than the first game because there is a war happening in the background, and the narrative is still very good and a lot of the sci-fi touches are neat.

I played for a bit more than 10hrs; HLTB says main story is around 9 hours and completionist runs around 16 hours, so that feels around right. I am not going for completion on this one, as I am not in the mood for another run, same as the first game. (The usual fantasy of "maybe I'll come back to it later" applies.) I did manage to get 22/30 achievements; most of the remaining ones are secret but one of them is like "complete the game on DANGEROUS difficulty" and I'm like "Mmmm... no!"
