### Big Tech / Our "Villains"

Fantastic headline by Rebecca Shaw on the Guardian: [I knew one day I’d have to watch powerful men burn the world down – I just didn’t expect them to be such losers](https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jan/16/i-knew-one-day-id-have-to-watch-powerful-men-burn-the-world-down-i-just-didnt-expect-them-to-be-such-losers). *Waves at Elon*

The Luddite writes about how [Paul Graham Sucks](https://theluddite.org/post/paul-graham.html):

> I think this is the single most important thing to understand about the tech scene; it's an industry that has fully internalized the values of capitalism at its most extreme. It is growth-obsessed, short-sighted, and entirely structured around the needs of investors, including even profit. You cannot be a software startup and just be a sustainable business; the ecosystem will reject you. Every single tech company has to become a unicorn or it is considered a failure. Paul Graham has turned that idea into a cult in tech, and its consequences are the technological world we are all forced to live with today.

[In Search of Logged Time - Public Books](https://www.publicbooks.org/in-search-of-logged-time/), an article about how these large platforms are managing our data:

> Most online data is owned by a small group of firms, and you know their names: Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. And companies like them have a brutal history of caring about profit at all costs. There may seem to be the illusion of free will—of uploading and deleting according to your discretion—but data can be completely destroyed or resurrected in the hands of a small few.
>
> As it stands, the current trend of disappearing data is likely to increase as storage spaces get tighter in accommodating generative AI content. Eventually, some of your memories will be deemed obsolete: not by the workings of your brain, but by a company that can’t afford to host them anymore.
>
> And when this happens, we, with our brains weak and soft from shunning Proustian labor, will not even remember what we have lost.

[The Digital Revolution has Failed](https://www.disconnect.blog/p/the-digital-revolution-has-failed):

> There can only be one conclusion from all of this: the digital revolution has failed. The initial promise was a deception to lay the foundation for another corporate value-creation scheme, but the benefits that emerged from it have been so deeply eroded by commercial imperatives that the drawbacks far outweigh the remaining redeeming qualities — and that only gets worse with every day generative AI tools are allowed to keep flooding the web with synthetic material.
> 
> The time for tinkering around the edges has passed, and like a phoenix rising from the ashes, the only hope to be found today is in seeking to tear down the edifice the tech industry has erected and to build new foundations for a different kind of internet that isn’t poisoned by the requirement to produce obscene and ever-increasing profits to fill the overflowing coffers of a narrow segment of the population.

### Fediverse / Small Web / "The Good Guys"

tante argues [against scale](https://tante.cc/2025/01/26/against-scale/):

> As people interested in a vibrant, humane, life-affirming social web I think we need to break the rut. And our very well built solutions are tying us down a bit too much I fear. When building for others we need to think less about “building the one right solution that everyone can use” but about building a thing that works for a specific set of people or that allows a community to actually change things in structural ways to serve their needs and wants, their practices and in-jokes.
> 
> I think we should think less about scaling our systems up perfectly and as frictionless as possible but about making the digital space more heterogenous, more weird. We shouldn’t try to pretend “this is Facebook but better for reasons you don’t care about” but build something that’s more of a “yeah Facebook wouldn’t allow this but we build this weird community where you can only post by using at least 3 swear words and a donkey image”.

[Nim](https://www.mmmx.cloud/me) writes two articles: ["We really like personal sites but the internet has been turning into poisonous garbage at an alarming rate"](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-really-like-personal-sites-but-the-internet-has-been-turning-into-poisonous-garbage-at-an-alarming-rate/) and the follow-up ["We got used to talking to the internet itself instead of people on the internet"](https://www.mmmx.cloud/we-got-used-to-talking-to-the-internet-itself-instead-of-people-on-the-internet/) on the problems with the modern internet. (The writer seems to be promoting some kind of open backlinking/tagging protocol called [Octothorpes](https://octothorp.es/about), I will check it out in the future and see if I can implement it.)

[Your App Should Have Been A Website (And Probably Your Game Too) - Rogue Engine](https://rogueengine.io/blog/your-app-should-have-been-a-website):

> Native apps are a pain for everyone involved. Developers pay hefty app store fees, jump through approval hoops, and juggle multiple platform versions. Users? We’re stuck with constant updates, wasted storage space, and apps that don’t even work on all our devices.
> 
> And don’t let anyone tell you the App Store solves discoverability. Apps aren’t “discovered” there; they’re marketed through ads, SEO, or word-of-mouth—just like websites. So why go through the extra hassle?

[Making a website is hard](https://blog.cathoderaydude.com/doku.php?id=blog:making_a_website_is_hard):

> i am sick of being told i should care about Enterprise Workloads. i am sick of everyone telling me that i should use their tool because it “scales.” i am not a corporation, i am not interested in getting millions of pairs of eyes on my website, i just want to put text and images on a page without having to assemble and operate a whole Toolchain. when did we give up on the idea that computers should make things easier? when did everyone decide that “1987 greentext unix machine” was the pinnacle of computing? i don't know, but i refuse to accept it.

Rachel by the Bay writes about [web page annoyances that her website thankfully doesn't inflict on us](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2025/01/04/cruft/). I think my own website doesn't do most (if not all) of these either!



### LLMs

[A short note on AI – Me, Robin](http://me.rbmntjs.nl/2024/a-short-note-on-ai/):

> I want better than that. I want real things by real people. I don’t want more things averaged out by a language model that can only make likely sentences. I don’t want more creepy images directly sourced from thousands of copyrighted works. I want you to put yourself on the page. If you can’t, no problem! But let’s not pretend that we’re doing the same thing here. With everything I make, I hope to put my heart on the table.

Rob Horning writes in [Born Sloppy](https://robhorning.substack.com/p/born-sloppy):

> But coming up with a specific label for one aspect of its harmfulness can function like a quarantine, as though we've isolated the risk and don't need to interrogate where “modern AI” comes from or for whose benefit it is being deployed. There is no good generative content; it’s all predatory slop. The positives, if there are any, would have to be snatched away from the negatives.


### Social Media

Rebecca Solnit sarcastically writes about [How to Comment on Social Media](https://lithub.com/rebecca-solnit-how-to-comment-on-social-media):

> 1) Do not read the whole original post or what it links to, which will dilute the purity of your response and reduce your chances of rebuking the poster for not mentioning anything they might’ve mentioned/written a book on/devoted their life to. Listening/reading delays your reaction time, and as with other sports, speed is of the essence.

[The Cyber-Cleanse: Take Back Your Digital Footprint](https://www.optoutproject.net/the-cyber-cleanse-take-back-your-digital-footprint/) is a step-by-step series of posts / guides about getting off the big social media platforms and regaining your tech independence. Honestly I don't know if I'd go so far as to do everything in this list, but it seems like a handy list to have as it is very detailed and thorough and recommends a lot of different tools to try.

The [Blogroll Network Map](https://alexsci.com/rss-blogroll-network/) is a map of blogrolls! The creator discusses it [here](https://alexsci.com/blog/blogroll-network/), and my favorite detail here is that apparently Dave Winer [proposed the `&lt;link rel="blogroll" ...&gt;` HTML element](https://opml.org/blogroll.opml) as a means to programmatically point to your blogroll. I [independently came to this same conclusion a few years ago](/2022/06/blogroll-updates/) and added it to my blog. The proposed standard page seems to have been created only last year, so whether it is true or not, my headcanon is that I was ahead of the curve on this one!

(Speaking of which, I am probably due for another blogroll update sometime soon...)

### Whew!

I still have soooo many saved links to go through, but this post is already way too long and I am tired. I am going to try to restart sharing via the [link blog](/links/) again, but I will probably need to do another [link dump](/tags/linkdump/) post soon as well!
