title: Ducktales Remastered
---

I started playing Ducktales Remastered on Steam last week because I wanted a game I could quickly knock off the backlog while waiting for new February releases. This game is from 2013!!

I thought it would be quick and easy, but it was a bit harder than I expected and even on medium difficulty some bosses gave me trouble. I especially had trouble with the final escape sequence (the timing on that thing is way too tight!) and had to repeat it a few times. I will not attempt completion, as that requires finishing Hard and Extreme difficulties and just the description of those made me nope out immediately.

Still, I did mostly enjoy the game and it was a welcome distraction from my recent troubles. The graphics are great but I didn't care too much for the plot (it was largely the same and as simplistic as the original) and honestly just skipped most of the cinematics. 

I played and enjoyed [the original](/2023/05/nes-games/#10-ducktales-famicom) back in the day of course. I claim to have finished it, but I have almost no recollection of most of the game, certainly not enough to compare to this modern version. This [YT video of the final boss/ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSS-hs4mdvw) suggests the older game was much simpler and maybe easier than this one, which was not what I would have expected!

Total playtime: 5.1 hours. 16/20 achievements.
