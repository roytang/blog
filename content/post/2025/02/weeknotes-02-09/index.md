### My Week

After some consultation with the doctors, Patient#3 has decided she no longer wants to continue chemo, so we are now in palliative care mode. We are still doing the daily oxygen rotation and home meds, but other than that, it's kind of just waiting for the inevitable. It is a weird feeling, like we are circling the drain. There is a mixture of guilt and antsiness about whether we should be doing more. The oncologist told us we should accept the patient's wishes and should not feel guilty over the natural course of the disease.

Some recent tech updates I hadn't noted elsewhere on the blog:

- A couple of weeks ago I bought a new 4TB Seagate external hard drive for backup purposes, as my older drives were starting to have trouble
- My cheapo mouse started double-clicking like crazy this past week, so I got a new Logitech G102 from Lazada. I've had one of these before and it lasted a few years; it's nothing fancy, but it has lights!
- The gaming chair I got in Dec 2023 before broke so easily. I got a replacement gaming chair from my bro before he left the country last December.
- Also got a new slightly bigger monitor from my bro, it is a 27in HP. I have updated [the Uses Page](/page/about/uses/) accordingly.

On the blog this week: a [game review for Ducktales Remastered](/2025/02/ducktales-remastered/), a [tech/web-related linkdump](/2025/02/tech-web-linkdump/), and a [post about consuming the news](/2025/02/consuming-news/).

### Media Diet

**Reading**: Still mostly just comics recently, **Wind and Truth** moving along very slowly. I am very good at making lists of books to read though. 

**Watching**: Still trying to keep up with **Dragon Ball Daima** and **Sakamoto Days**, both via Netflix. Finished watching **What If Season 3** on Disney+ and **The Penguin** on Max; one of those was much better than the other. Also started watching **Pantheon** on Netflix and **Invincible S3** on Prime Video.

**Gaming**: Still mostly just trying to keep up with **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game**. I finished [Ducktales Remastered](/2025/02/ducktales-remastered/)! Have also been playing **Citizen Sleeper 2** on PC Game Pass! I was originally planning on getting Civ7 at launch, but when the review embargo lifted and the reviews weren't universally great, I decided to hold off and reinstalled Civ5 instead lol.

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 58,921 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I still have yet to hit the 70k quota this year, but at least my numbers are steadily rising, so that's something.

### Links to Share

finally have some new stuff on the [linkblog](/links) this week:

- [How to Copy a File From a 30-year-old Laptop - Unterminated](https://www.unterminated.com/random-fun/how-to-copy-a-file-from-a-30-year-old-laptop)

    This was a fun tech story

- [The Making of an Anti-Woke Zealot: How Elon Musk Was Infected with the MAGA Mind-Virus ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/the-making-of-an-anti-woke-zealot-how-elon-musk-was-infected-with-the-maga-mind-virus/)

    A history of Musk's radicalization. All of this just reinforces my belief that being too full of yourself and not being able to admit mistakes can lead to disastrous consequences, especially when you have billions at your disposal.

    There's an excerpt about how he plays cards that sounds about right:

    > “There were all these nerds and sharpsters who were good at memorizing cards and calculating odds,” he told Musk biographer Walter Isaacson. “Elon just proceeded to go all in on every hand and lose. Then he would buy more chips and double down. Eventually, after losing many hands, he went all in and won. Then he said, ‘Right, fine, I’m done.'”

    On quitting:

    > Remember also that quitting is a choice and you get to make it. That’s one of the most beautiful and sacred things about quitting—it’s an exercise of your agency and power in the world, and one that no one can take away from you. You are the one who knows what’s best for you and your kin, and you get to decide how to act on that knowledge. Someday, maybe someday soon, that will mean making the choice to quit—and I invite you to honor that choice, as you honor your great and beautiful life.
