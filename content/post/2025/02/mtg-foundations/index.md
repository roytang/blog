### Set Notes

- I played a lot less Foundations than I usually do, skipping out on the second half of November and the middle two weeks of December due to life getting in the way (this is also why I wasn't able to complete the mastery pass for this set). I didn't even play 4 out of 10 archetypes!
- I had trouble finding my footing and started out terribly, with a string of 1-x and 0-x drafts, but eventually recovered enough to get my win rate above 50% and even snagging a trophy along the way.
- Draft format was a bit bleah, with a lot of the archetypes being the typical ones for those colors; this is I guess to be expected since Foundations is a "core set" of sorts.
- I did enjoy the random special guests in the set; one of my drafts had an insane start where I picked Progenitus and hoped to Zombify him... luckily I read the card before actually putting him in the deck and realized that wouldn't work!
- A friend convinced me to shift from my usual default build of 41 cards with 17 lands to 40 cards with 16 lands, since the shuffler helps make sure your first draw isn't too mana light (I'm always playing BO1). The very first draft I tried this with was the one that got to 7, so anecdotal success!

### 7-x Draft Decks

Didn't get a trophy until my 7th draft in.

### Magic Arena Stats

As mentioned, I didn't have a lot of time to draft and missed a few weeks, so I wasn't able to complete the mastery for this season.

### Streaming videos

No streams this time sadly!

### Notes on Recent MTG News

Was honestly thinking of cutting back on my Arena playtime for a while, at least until the Final Fantasy set comes out, as Aetherdrift and the next Tarkir set aren't really too exciting for me. But then with the latest update, they added ACHIEVEMENTS! I'm a sucker for those, so I have been playing a bit more lol.

### Next

Been enjoying Aetherdrift drafts a bit more than expected; win rates aren't too bad, but no trophies yet.
