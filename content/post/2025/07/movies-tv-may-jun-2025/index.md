### Movies

My recent movies watched include Wright's Cornetto Trilogy. I've also decided to try to catch up with the Disney animated films and Jackie Chan's repertoire, mostly because of posts I read on Reddit. (It is unlikely I ever complete either of those, but whatever!)

#### The Burial (2023)

Watched on 2025-05-02: ★★★½



{{% photos the-burial-2023 %}}

 Had this on my to-watch list for a while because I always love a good courtroom drama. Was surprised to find out it was based on a true story. The case is mostly about racism and appeals to emotion and character rather than legal shenanigans though. And while Foxx's Willie Gary is built up as a highly charismatic trial lawyer, for some reason we are denied the pleasure of his closing argument!

#### Hot Fuzz (2007)

{{% photos hot-fuzz-2007 %}}

 This is the only Cornetto film I haven't seen before. I've only caught bits and pieces of this one before on cable or whatnot so I have a fair idea of the plot; this is the first time I've sat down to watch the film in full. It is so good; the visual comedy is top notch and a lot of the gags are hilarious and Pegg and Frost are still very good together. Yarp!

#### The World's End (2013)

Watched on 2025-06-04: ★★★★



{{% photos the-worlds-end-2013 %}}

 This one is a rewatch, but probably only the second time I've seen the film and it's been a while so it's kinda new in a way. The film starts out as a typical tale of a middle-aged loser trying to recapture the magic of his youth, getting the band back together to relive their old adventures. Around halfway through the movie abruptly shifts in tone to an alien invasion movie. I remember being completely blindsided and flabergasted by this back during my first watch and it was great.

I had forgotten that Rosamund Pike and Pierce Brosnan appear in this film (most likely I didn't even know who Rosamund Pike was when I first watched it.)

One would think the movie ends with our protags saving the day and living happily ever after and Pegg's Gary King maturing and learning his lessons. Nope, that's not how it ends at all lol

Rating 0.5 stars below hot fuzz because of the more ridiculous premise, but otherwise still a fun romp.

#### Shaun of the Dead (2004)

Watched on 2025-06-06: ★★★★



{{% photos shaun-of-the-dead-2004 %}}

 I first watched this back in 2012, and it was still pretty fun on rewatch but I enjoyed it more now that I watched it in the same week as the rest of the trilogy. It makes it much easier to see and appreciate all of Edgar Wright's tricks and visual callbacks and clever gags!

While watching HF and TWE I thought I had hallucinated a scene where Pegg tries to jump over a fence and it falls over, the same way Nick Frost does it in HF, but it turns out that scene was in this film instead!

 This was fun and better than I expected. The overall plot is kind of like if Trump was in charge of our space colonization efforts, but don't expect any deep societal commentary.

 This was very good; basically Jackie Chan in a John Wick-style revenge flick. No happy endings for anybody!

 Looking to catch up on old Disney/Pixar that I've never seen, starting with this one. Was surprised that it started out with a mass murder of a man's family! I guess disney/pixar protags with tragic back story isn't uncommon. The sharks were fun. Dory was fun. The fish in the tank were fun. Even the dentist was fun. Fun movie!

#### Deep Cover (2025)

{{% photos deep-cover-2025 %}}

 I didn't have any expectations for this one but it was surprisingly solid. They just kept accidentally getting in deeper and deeper into more ridiculous and dangerous situations. All three of the leads are great here, but I always enjoy Nick Mohammed's performances and Orlando Bloom's character is kind of a walking trope but it all comes together somehow.

 This was... fine? Dory was a very fun character from the first film, so it's understandable they brought her back. The film is more about Dory finding things / other characters than the other way around though. Still pretty fun, and lots of recognizable voices in the new supporting characters!

Some excellent TV in this batch!

Additional: Andor basically giving us all ideas for how to organize against fascism feels super appropriate for the current era.

So good and so tragic. A brutal depiction of what it's like to be in an emergency room on the worst of days. Some excellent performances here, especially from Noah Wyle and all the new doctors.

#### Doctor Who (Disney+) S1-S2

Finished watching on 2025-06-08: ★★★½

Ncuti Gatwa brought a uniquely capricious and flamboyant approach to his 15th doctor. There are some excellent episodes in there ("73 Yards" was probably my favorite of this run) and some stinkers too ("Space Babies" ugh) and I mostly enjoyed the overarching plot of the two seasons, though a lot of it crumbles on closer inspection.

RTD has kind of a reputation for laying wide-ranging and epic and complicated plots across entire seasons that he tries to stitch together at the end, but he kinda fell short here. It's not entirely his fault; he had to deal with cast members unexpectedly leaving which led to rewrites and ultimately he was apparently unable to wrap things up as he initally planned. We may never know the finer details.

That being said, I enjoyed the Disney+ seasons and still hope Doctor Who manages to come back in light of the current uncertainty. 

#### The Simpsons S35-S36

Finished watching on 2025-06-15: ★★★½

I doubt people will ever see The Simpsons as returning to the quality levels of the early seasons, but these recent seasons are still decent watching (especially while doing something else) and sometimes still manage to explore some interesting space, seemingly never running out of human troubles to make light of. If there's any show that has a chance of just chugging on forever until the end of humanity, it might very well be The Simpsons.

Surprisingly good for a cold case detective story. At first I thought it was going to be a procedural case-per-episode kind of thing, but nope, a single case from start to end, brought to a satisfying conclusion (though they left the initial shooting unresolved, presumably for a season 2?). Matthew Goode's grumpy detective Carl Morck is a good lead, but my favorite character was the quiet yet mysteriously menacing assistant Akram.
