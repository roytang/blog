It&#39;s just amazing how they managed to weave it all together while respecting the continuity of the films and even Rebels.</p>\n\n<p>I just found out that Tony Gilroy (Andor showrunner and R1 cowriter) was also the screenwriter for the original Bourne trilogy, which explains how good the infiltration and escape sequences in Andor are. I kind of want him to do something for the MCU!</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://indieweb.social/tags/tv\" class=\"mention hashtag\" rel=\"tag\">#<span>tv</span></a></p>",
