### The World

IDK, still mostly terrible I guess?

### My Week

- I wanted to attend a quiz night or two this week, but the trivia team was not available.
- Tuesday: I went to the doctor for a routine checkup, and unsurprisingly I had to wait 2 hours past the call time before the doctor even came in. Always annoying, but at least it helped me read a book. (See below). Also, I went there wearing my Superman T-shirt and only belatedly realized that meant I can't wear it to the movie!
- Wednesday: My brother suddenly decided around lunchtime that we were watching Superman that afternoon so I went out to the mall to meet him. The previous weekend when we were discussing the plan to watch Superman this week my other brother jokingly commented that we were the only ones keeping local cinemas afloat, but happily there were a lot of people watching Superman even on the 4:15pm IMAX showing (not a full house given an afternoon showing, but much more than the dismal audience Thunderbolts got), and there were even some kids wearing Superman costumes!
- My eyes have been a bit gunky recently so I passed by the nearby optical shop to buy some Systane eye drops that I had bought from them before to help with dry eyes. I had forgotten how expensive these were.
- We had a couple of internet outages over the past couple of weeks. The one last week was worse - almost 24 hours between Wednesday and Thursday. We had an outage again last night and I was worried it would be a long one again, but thankfully it only lasted 3 hours. These short bursts of being offline did remind me that we used to manage just fine without the internet all the time as recently as a couple of decades ago, and that there were still a lot of things I could do offline to be productive. To that end, I found myself having a Winamp installation again lol.
- I am doing so much website stuff in prep for a big change I wanna do, and I wish I could write about it already, but it may take a while (I mean, I already promised a big update two years ago that hasn't manifested yet)
- On the blog: I [ranted a bit about the problems with HP printer and scanner software](/2025/07/hp-scanning/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Still trying to get through Fear Itself and also catch up on recent comics again.
- Books: 
    - I knew I was probably in for a wait at the doctor's clinic (see above), so I brought with me a copy of **Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir. My brother lent me this copy late last year and I found out recently there would be a movie adaptation coming out so I thought I'd read it. I was already 1/3rd into it by the time the doctor arrived and I think almost 50% right now. It is a very easy read; not a lot of characters to keep track of, and I just eat up the science stuff.
    - Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** had a bit of progress but sadly is still only at 35% despite my having been reading it since the start of the year. I do find the book interesting, but it's not always easy to progress because as the last book in this arc there are always soooo many characters and locations and events and whatnot and I always find myself trying to remember or look up who they are. It's been ten years since [I started reading this series](/2015/06/10153836569638912/) after all! (Also, to be absolutely fair, 35% of Wind and Truth's word count is much more than Project Hail Mary's total!)

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**, **Dandadan S2**.
- Movies: This week I watched [Superman (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/superman-2025/) and the Jackie Chan flick [Who Am I (1998)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/who-am-i/).

#### Gaming

There was a Steam sale the past couple of weeks but these days it's easy to avoid damage just by browsing through my enormous backlog.

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: I was thinking of quitting Snap, but I still mostly enjoy the games (just not the tedious grind for new cards), so now I am still playing it, just a bit more casually I guess.
    - **Magic Arena**:I am doing a bit better in Final Fantasy quick drafts in July and got my 3rd trophy last night! 
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. 
    - Ongoing: Trawling through my backlog made me load up my **Borderlands 2** save again. I actually also own *Pre-Sequel* and *Borderlands 3* on Steam, but I don't want to move forward with those games until I "complete" B2, and I haven't actually finished most of the DLC for this one (despite having played through the main campaign at least twice already)
    - Stalled: **Disgaea 4** on PS Vita. Maybe it's one of those "I'll pick it up again in a few years" scenarios?
    - Stalled: **Blue Prince**. Maybe I'll just write the review already and it will forever remain on the back burner as one of those roguelikes I play occasionally. But it still has so many secrets to uncover!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 64,379 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), a slight improvement over last week. It was actually a very good week for walking, a bit less rain than the previous weeks and I had more activities which always helps.

### Links to Share

Not a lot this week.

- [44 - annie's blog](https://anniemueller.com/posts/44)

    I love these kinds of list posts where people are just doling out lots of short nuggets of wisdom

- [A Post By @ajroach42 on Retro Social](https://retro.social/@ajroach42/114811505328252889)

    Longish but great and insightful thread from [@ajroach42](https://retro.social/@ajroach42) about modern tech problems, propaganda, microcults, low attention spans, the difficulty of getting young people interested in reading, forming an intentional relationship with technology etc

### Looking Forward

We are probably attending a quiz night on Thursday.

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:

- Jul 14 Sakamoto Days S2
- Jul 17 Strange New Worlds S3

This weeknotes ended up longer than I expected.
