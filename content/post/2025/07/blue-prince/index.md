Usually I wait until I have "completed" single-player games before writing about them, but I started playing **Blue Prince** back in April and have kind of been ignoring it for almost two months already, so it's probably time to write about it already before I lose all context.

**Blue Prince** is a puzzle roguelike. When I first heard about it I had no idea what that meant and mostly went in blind not knowing what to expect. The story is that you inherit a house (manor really) from your puzzle-loving uncle and in order to earn your inheritance you have to "solve" the house to reach the mysterious "Room 46". You navigate the house by drafting rooms; it reminds me a lot of boardgames where you place the tiles as you go along (I think *Betrayal at House on the Hill* played like this, though I'm not sure when I get to play that). When you get too tired (run out of *steps*), you have to call it a day and the house rooms reset the next day. 

There are no actual instructions for how to get to room 46, you have to figure it out as you go. As you navigate the house you have to find clues and figure out secrets and solve puzzles and as you go kind of find out that BASICALLY EVERYTHING IS A CLUE. Or might be a clue. It's all kind of maddening. Taking notes is highly encouraged. I included in this post a couple of photos of my posts and honestly a lot of my notes look insane! Anyway, don't zoom in on the notes photos in case you don't want to be spoiled.

It's so hard to write about the game (or even to talk about it really) because of the urge to avoid spoilers. Like a couple of people at one of the quiz nights I attended were talking about the game and I tried to discuss it with them a bit but couldn't figure out what to say (because we did not know exactly how far each of us was into the game) except that it was kind of driving me insane; and I ended up learning about a secret room I hadn't found yet, which I would rather not have.

The game is all about figuring out secrets, and annoyingly whenever you feel like you have figured something out it feels like you just uncover even more things to figure out. If you love puzzles, digging up clues and solving mysteries, you'll love it, but also it might make you dangerously obsessive, IDK.

### Completion

The objective given to you at the start of the game is to get to Room 46, and I achieved that on the 26th run, so in that sense I have "finished" the game. But really, that is just the first layer of things to do in this game; getting to room 46 for the first time just unlocks a ton of other secrets that you have to figure out (and I haven't even solved all the things already available to you at the start).

So far I have done 70+ runs. The game only has 16 achievements, and so far I have only gotten 8. Each one is very hard. Some will take many, many more runs because of the game's RNG/roguelike nature. Which is why I am giving up and just writing my reviews already.

Total playtime so far: around 60 hours.

In-game stats that you won't understand if you haven't played it yet (as of when I started writing this post):

- all external house add-ons unlocked (I think)
- 90+ allowance 
- 3 red envelopes
- 4 sanctum keys and puzzles solved

I am kind of proud that I was able to do all of the above with very minimal spoilers or looking things up. 

### Screenshots

I have taken many, many screenshots. Somewhere on the order of 200. Most of them are in lieu of notes and I had to organize my screenshots into subfolders and everything to make it easy to find things! It is however a bit difficult to share many of the screenshots, because I consider the vast majority of them to be spoilers. So not a lot here.

### Moving Forward

I do not plan to uninstall the game. Like many roguelikes, there is still a lot of replay value and there are still many, many secrets to be uncovered. Actually, in the course of writing this post I did a couple of runs and accidentally solved a secret puzzle already. I also ended up looking up 2 minor things that turned out to have very vague and kinda infuriating solutions, so there is that. I hope to revisit it every so often and maybe chip away at some of those other secrets and achievements I have yet to unlock.
