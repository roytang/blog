The rare time I read an IRL book! My brother lent me this book late last year and I held off on reading it (because I was trying to get through *Wind and Truth*) but decided to start it after they released a trailer for the upcoming film adaptation. The internet said the trailer had spoilers for the film, and they were right! I'm glad I read it first. The major plot point spoiled happens early in the book, but it would have been more fun to not know about it beforehand.

But now that means I can't talk about that major plot point in this review! Oh wait, yes I can.

{{< spoiler >}}The spoiler is that there is an alien in this story. It was very exciting when he ran into another spaceship, so it's too bad that the reveal was already spoiled in the trailer, though I can understand it for marketing purposes. The relationship between our protag and his alien friend is one of the best things about the story; it plays a bit like a science buddy copy kind of thing!{{< /spoiler >}}

Anyway, I thought the book was great! I never read the author's previous book *The Martian*, though [I thoroughly enjoyed the film adaptation](/2015/12/movies-2015/#the-martian-2015) and consider it [my favorite sci-fi movie of the 2010s](/2020/01/top-ten-2010s/). This book has a lot of the same energy to it and it's very obvious how "into science" the author is.

Despite being a science fiction book, the thing I find most unbelievable about it is (spoiler tag again):

{{< spoiler >}}That the people and all the disparate nations of Earth would come together to try to solve a crisis that was decades away from being a problem. They could have at least had some conspiracy theorists or astrophage deniers that created some conflict on Earth. I can understand why the author avoided it but it just doesn't seem believable given what we know about our world today!{{< /spoiler >}}

The book isn't very long - less than 500 pages and maybe 25% of the word count of *Wind and Truth*. I got through it in about 10 days, only reading every so often.

Highly recommended especially if you enjoyed The Martian, and I am looking forward to the film adaptation! (Trailer embedded below, but don't watch if you don't wanna be spoiled!).

Kinda wanna rewatch The Martian now.
