It is July! I wish I could say I have made progress on my yearly goals.

### The World

Trump's signature legislation has been passed, the main feature of which is apparently a lot of healthcare cuts and a budget for ICE (i.e. the US gestapo) bigger than that of Russia. Meanwhile, war continues in Ukraine and Gaza and such.

### My Week

It was a light week for me. Mostly stayed at home except for the daily walks. New month meant the usual monthly tasks including bills and all that. A reminder that to exist in this world means having to pay your dues.

On the blog: Posted [my movie and TV reviews for May & June](/2025/07/movies-tv-may-jun-2025/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Powered through the Thor 2007 volume and the Siege event, now on Fraction's Mighty Thor and the Fear Itself event (ugh, this one has so many tie-ins!). Still trying to keep up with the weekly releases as well.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** had no progress this week! Also, last year my brother lent me a copy of Andy Weir's *Project Hail Mary* which I haven't touched yet. I found out it's getting a movie adaptation so I'm kind of tempted to get started on that already.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**.
- Started: **Dandadan S2**. A pleasant surprise, I thought it was gonna start in mid July!
- Finished: **Iron Heart** on Disney+. I am not super happy with the direction they took Riri in (admittedly I haven't read much of her in the comics to compare), but I can see what they were going for.
- Movies: Looks like I only watched [Sunshine (2007)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/sunshine-2007/) this past week. 

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**. 
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. The performance has improved a bit after I updated my graphics drivers.
    - Ongoing: **Disgaea 4** on PS Vita. Have slowed down a bit and am still overwhelmed by the amount of stuff I have to do, but still super easy to pickup at any time.
    - Stalled: **Blue Prince**. 

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 60,286 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), almost 10k improvement over last week, and we manage to hit the target 5 times out of 7. It's still very rainy, so some of those walks have been with an umbrella which is always annoying.

### Links to Share

Trying to get through my backlog.

- [online attention | ava's blog](https://blog.avas.space/online-attention/)

    > "Seeing how easy it is to get attention while most of it is so disgusting, why is it worthwhile to you? Why do you still believe that attention is a reward that goes to people who are better than you and worked so hard to deserve it? Many, many people do fuck-all in terms of how hard it was. Doing the above things is not hard. Staying authentic and true to yourself without being swayed by public opinion and attention is."

    lol this was great

- [A simple website](https://simplesite.ayra.ch/)

    This was a great look back at what the web was like back in the day. I didn't even know that long-polling thing was popular back in the day.

    > "But I think the core of what pisses me off is that selling this magic machine requires selling the idea that doing things is worthless.  Because if doing something has some value, then it must be somehow better than pushing a button and receiving Whatever for essentially no cost. ... It is the greatest threat to your business model.  You have to destroy the idea that things are worth doing."

    Article is kinda long and preaching to the choir, but the examples and discussion are great
