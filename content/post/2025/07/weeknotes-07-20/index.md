### The World

Trump is kinda panicking over this whole Einstein thing, especially after the WSJ published an article about a bawdy letter he wrote many years ago.

Some tech company CEO got caught in an affair because of a kisscam at a Coldplay concert and there have been so many memes.

Paramount has cancelled Stephen Colbert's Late Show mere days after he criticized Paramount's settlement with the Trump admin, claiming it was for "financial reasons". The franchise has been running since 1993! And has only ever had two regular hosts - Letterman and Colbert. The show will run until 2026 when Colbert's contract ends.

I always wish I have more non-US stuff to write about in this space, but it's not like there's any improvement in Gaza or Ukraine.

### My Week

- Sometime this past week, we ended up leaving the house unattended for a few hours. This is the first time we've done this in the 25 years I've lived in this house. Usually if the parents go out I stay at home. It's just much harder to always have someone at home after we lost Patient #3 earlier this year. But I think it's kind of something we have to get used to having to do every so often. Unsurprisingly, this gave me a lot of anxiety. Largely irrational, since this isn't the sort of neighborhood where anything untoward is likely to happen, but you never know. To help soothe my fears, I set up some additional security measures such as a livestream of the house that I can check while I was away. As predicted, nothing happened thankfully. But at least now I have a few hours worth of video of the living room, so yay?
- Trivia team attended two quiz nights this week, [one on Thursday](/2025/07/popquiz-anniv9-bts/) and [one on Saturday](/collections/quiznights/aboutquiz-math). Sadly we did not do well in either one.
- Nothing extra on the blog this week.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Not a lot of progress. Still trying to get through the Fear Itself tie-ins and also catch up on recent comics again.
- Books: 
    - I finished **Project Hail Mary** yesterday! Finally finished a book this year! Will write a review this week.
    - Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** had a bit of progress and is currently at 48%.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**, **Dandadan S2**.
- Started: **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**.
- Movies: This week I watched [Lilo and Stitch (2002)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/lilo-stitch/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: Still playing casually, and even ignoring the ongoing High Voltage events.
    - **Magic Arena**: Currently in Diamond limited with Final Fantasy drafts. Sadly and unsurprisingly, it has been much harder to win games once I got into Diamond.
- Other online games:
    - **Marvel Rivals**: I don't play this a lot, but I decided to pick it up again for a Discord quest and found myself enjoying playing as The Thing who had been added during my hiatus. I'm still not very good at the game mind you.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. I think I am more than halfway through the main story.
    - Ongoing: **Borderlands 2**, working my way through some DLC.
    - Started: **Crusader Kings 3**. I've had this in my library for a while and thought I'd try it. I played CK2 a bit mostly for the role-playing opportunities, but never really understood how to take advantage of the many systems. I thought CK3 might end up being a bit easier. So far, this is not true.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 48,396 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), my worst week since January. Part of it was because I had to spend two days house-sitting, but also we had a typhoon here over the weekend and it was just very, very rainy. I did manage to hit 10k on 4 days out of 7, so that's something I guess.

### Links to Share

Not a lot this week.

    > "I had put a lot of work time and mental energy into social media because I had been told by lots of trustworthy sources — like people who worked in publishing, fellow authors and my writers' union — that it was the best way to help my book reach as many interested readers as possible. In fact, my posts had reached very few people and contributed very little to the success of the book. Plus, they were very time consuming to make so had eaten up leisure time and my capacity to do other work."

    The post succinctly lays out the arguments against using, or even talking about, genAI. My favorite part is under the heading "Even in the best case scenario, I’m not sure this is the job I want" and is too long to be quoted here.

### Looking Forward

No quiz nights scheduled for this coming week, but I am looking forward to watching Fantastic Four: First Steps when it comes out!

The weather forecast looks like it's going to be a very rainy week, so I am not optimistic about my step count this time.
