### The World

It has been a very rainy week over here and unsurprisingly that came with uncontrolled flooding in various places around the Metro and the usual celebrations of Filipino "resilience" and decrying of government incompetence. Meanwhile, our President was off in the US meeting with Trump and our VP was off gallivanting somewhere abroad as well. Oh, and the Acting Mayor of Davao challenged the PNP Chief to a fistfight but then chickened out when an actual charity boxing match was scheduled and the PNP Chief won by default.

### My Week

- Went out to the mall last Friday to watch Fantastic Four (review linked below). Our IMAX tickets gave us a couple of shots at this claw game thing where I could get a Galactus keychain!! We did not win.
- We ordered Angel's Pizza recently but I could not find my discount card and it led to me going through all my drawers. I failed to find it, but I did find some other things I had been missing like: some expensive MTG cards I wanted to inventory and had been wondering where they went; my PS4 controller with cable that I was looking for because I still want to turn on the PS4 every so often; and a renewed sense of needing to clean my room.
- On the blog: reviews of [Blue Prince](/2025/07/blue-prince/) and [Project Hail Mary](/2025/07/project-hail-mary/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Not a lot of progress. Still trying to get through the Fear Itself tie-ins and also catching up on recent comics again.
- Books: 
    - Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** had a bit of progress and is currently at 57%.
    - I have a theory that I am having much less reading progress this year because I am spending much less time waiting around in hospitals. I guess that is a good thing though.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Rick and Morty S8**, **Dandadan S2**, **Sakamoto Days S2**, **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds S3**
- Movies: This week I watched [Fantastic Four: First Steps (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-fantastic-four-first-steps/) and [Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/avatar-the-way-of-water/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Marvel Snap**: There is a new Commander-like limited time game mode, which feels much less sucky than last month's LTGM.
    - **Magic Arena**: I have quit the Final Fantasy drafts already as I am out of currency and the next set is dropping next week! Have to save up a bit before I can afford to draft again!
- Other online games:
    - **Marvel Rivals**: Played a bit of this over the week. Still not very good at it.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Haven't played this in a while; played a bit this week to clear out a bit of the backlog of single-player missions
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Final Fantasy XVI** on Steam. Progress is slow, I don't expect to finish this til the end of August at the latest maybe.
    - Ongoing: **Borderlands 2**, working my way through some DLC, very slowly.
- Other stuff:
    - A couple of weeks ago, the trivia team had an online sesh where we played **Jackbox Games**; something we haven't done in a while! It was good fun and we recorded some of the games and they are up on [the Team Camote Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph/videos) if you like that kind of thing.
    - For a few months now, my weekend gaming group has been playing [Sunderfolk](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2414270/Sunderfolk/), which we've started to call the "bad mobile interface" game, for reasons that should become clear when I write my eventual review!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I only walked 51,477 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Frankly I was expecting my step counts to be much worse than that given that we were experiencing heavy torrential rains for the entire week. The country was hit with 3 typhoons in rapid succession, enhanced of course by the *habagat*. I took my walks when I can!

    [From Genny Rumancik](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMbE6VOhDzv/):

    > Hard things are supposed to be hard.

    >

    > Changing old patterns, ending relationships you’ve outgrown, raising children, creating from your core, letting go, stretching, growing, and stepping into the unknown.

    >

    > The more worthwhile endeavors require you to show up vulnerably & honestly, and they leave space for something new to happen.

    > "I think that realistically, our main weapon in this war is AI etiquette. My own take on AI etiquette is that AI output can only be relayed if it's either adopted as your own or there is explicit consent from the receiving party."

    He also says "There's nothing wrong with using AI", which I disagree with.

- [Paul's Notes | The Promised LAN](https://notes.pault.ag/tpl/)

    > "This is a call for you to do the same. Build your own LAN. Connect it with friends’ homes. Remember what is missing from your life, and fill it in. Use software you know how to operate and get it running. Build slowly. Build your community. Do it with joy. Remember how we got here. Rebuild a community space that doesn’t need to be mediated by faceless corporations and ad revenue. Build something sustainable that brings you joy. Rebuild something you use daily."

- [The AI Replaces Services Myth - by Mert Deveci](https://aimode.substack.com/p/the-ai-replaces-services-myth)

    > The AI-replaces-services narrative is fantasy.

    >

    > Not because AI can't do the work. It can.

    >

    > But because the economics don't translate the way VCs claim. When you replace a $50,000 employee with AI, you don't capture $50,000 in software revenue. You capture $5,000 if you're lucky.

    > The market isn't 100-200x bigger. It's maybe 10-20% of what the PowerPoints claim.

    I love people just putting together random stuff like this on their websites!

- [In praise of zines](https://buttondown.com/blog/zines)

    > "Write urgently. Publish quickly."

    > "The same goes for the ideas, the words you’ll write down. Write them down when they’re on the top of your mind, while you’re still excited to get them out. For ideas have a half-life of their own. Wait and they’ll go stale, and you’ll second-guess if they’re worth publishing."

- [I'm Done With Social Media](https://www.carolinecrampton.com/im-done-with-social-media/)

    > "I had put a lot of work time and mental energy into social media because I had been told by lots of trustworthy sources — like people who worked in publishing, fellow authors and my writers' union — that it was the best way to help my book reach as many interested readers as possible. In fact, my posts had reached very few people and contributed very little to the success of the book. Plus, they were very time consuming to make so had eaten up leisure time and my capacity to do other work."

- [paddy carver: Tired of Talking About AI](https://paddy.carvers.com/posts/2025/07/ai/)

    The post succinctly lays out the arguments against using, or even talking about, genAI. My favorite part is under the heading "Even in the best case scenario, I’m not sure this is the job I want" and is too long to be quoted here.
