Trying to sneak in one last game review before the year ends!

I usually only enjoy beat-em-up games when playing multiplayer/coop, so I was not initially planning to get into **Marvel Cosmic Invasion**. A friend and I played through the demo together and enjoyed it, but when it released he said he wasn't planning on getting it yet, so I put it out of mind. Fast forward to just before Christmas Day and he ended up purchasing it lol. It's also in the PC Game Pass subscription which I have been planning to cancel but haven't yet, so we coordinated to play through the campaign during the past week or so. Luckily cross-play between Steam and GP versions works well.

The game is still a fun, old-school-style "walk to the right and punch bad guys along the way" kind of game, except with the Marvel flavor, which of course made me more interested. After playing the demo, I was looking forward to seeing which other areas you visit, which villains appear as stage bosses, and so on.

### Roster

Compared to other beat-em-ups, the roster is huge and pretty varied, and they did a good job of making each character feel and play differently. I think you have 10 characters available at the start and can unlock 5 more by progressing the campaign. As a fighting game enthusiast AND a Marvel fan, I still kinda wish there were more characters! Fifteen characters seems like a lot, but each player uses two characters per stage so if you get a full complement of 4 players, more than half the cast is used up. I do expect more characters via DLC though. 

### Campaign

The campaign isn't that long (typical of the genre); there are 16 stages in total to fight through, including a tutorial mission. We managed to get to the final boss in something like 3-4 hours of play, but that final boss fight was quite brutal. After a few failed attempts with just the two of us, we somehow convinced a friend to get the game as well. The difficulty scales up for 1,2, and 4 players, so I believe it is slightly optimal to play with a party of 3! And sure enough, after playing through a few of the earlier stages so our new party member could learn the ropes, we finally beat the final boss on the next attempt! Sure, our new party member was dead by the end of it, but he helped by dealing some damage and soaking some hits!

### Other Stuff

Every time you complete a level with a character, the character gets some experience points in a sort of meta progression. Characters can level up to 10, which gives small buffs to stats and can even unlock a passive ability. 

Aside from the campaign, there is an Arcade mode to play through, and you can unlock different arcade mode modifiers to make things more interesting.

Playing stages earns you cubes, which you can use to unlock stuff like data files, audio files, arcade mode modifiers, alternate palettes for the heroes.

### Completion and Stats

Not gonna attempt it with this one, since I am planning to unsub from Game Pass soon, but our campaign run did at least get me to 11/35 achievements over less than 5 hours of playtime, which isn't too bad. I looked over the other achievements and they don't seem to hard, but they are kinda grindy, with some that go like "beat 50 bad guys with this character's special ability". Since the campaign isn't that long, you probably to do a lot of arcade runs to unlock everything.
