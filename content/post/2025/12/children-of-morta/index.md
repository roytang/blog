title: Children of Morta
---

A friend introduced me to *Children of Morta* a while back and I got it on sale and it sat in my backlog for a few years. When I got a Steam Deck a couple of months ago, I planned to use it to clear out some smaller games from my backlog and this game seemed like a good candidate!

*Children of Morta* came out in 2019 and is a pixel-art top-down hack and slash roguelike action RPG, with gameplay a bit similar to the Diablo games I guess? You play as the members of the Bergson family, tasked with guarding against an encroaching corruption from the nearby mountain god or some such. Your party members venture into the dungeons one at a time to do quests and figure out how to defeat the corruption.

Each family member has their own fighting style. At the game start, you can only use the daddy Bergson as a playable character (a tanky sword-and-shield guy). With each dungeon run (win or lose), you get some cutscenes and eventually manage to unlock additional playable family members: eldest daughter is an archer-type, middle son is a dagger-wielding close-range stealth DPS type, eldest son is a punch-and-staff kind of guy, youngest daughter is a fireball-slinging mage-type, and boy cousin is a heavy hitting hammer guy. There is also an additional playable character who is NOT a family member, which was confusing until I found out she was a post-release addition from fan feedback.

Earlier runs are a bit challenging, and it's likely you fail. But with each run you gain experience to level your characters and currency that can be used to purchase upgrades. Levelling up each character unlocks new abilities and bonuses that can affect the whole family. Upgrades are general stat improvements for everyone (more HP, attack damage, dodge rate etc.). The family house acts as a hub between runs from where they can access any of the available dungeons and purchase upgrades and such.

The story can get a bit dark; basically humans caught up in the affairs of gods with a threat that may tear the family apart. But many of the between-run-cutscenes and even the idle animations and dialog in the house also portray a sweet and loving family, giving you an incentive to try to protect them from harm. Also, there is a dog (well, wolf pup) you can rescue if you like that kind of thing. (You cannot pet the dog, but he appears before each stage boss and you can interact with him for a bonus.)

All of the cutscenes are narrated by a single voice with an appropriate dark adventure tone; I think he is the only voice used in the entire game.

The pixel art is fine and can even get a bit high-res in some cutscenes, but honestly I don't think it contributes a lot as the game doesn't really have a retro vibe. The game probably would have worked just as well with a more traditional-style 2d sprite animation maybe?

Sadly, the main game content gets tired a bit quickly. I think there are only around 8 playable dungeons that you can repeatedly attempt. Each dungeon run is procedurally-generated, and there are also special events and NPCs you can meet while in the dungeons, but you will be doing many, many runs and with there being only 8 playable dungeons, it all starts to get a bit samey towards the end. And while the difficulty level is fine at first, later in the game when you are earning a lot of gold and have a lot of upgrades unlocked, each run can quickly become too easy (hint: as soon as you can, max out the upgrade that increases your gold earned). By the time I finished the main story, not even upping the difficulty level from Normal to Hard made things more interesting.

This game also has coop! You can have a friend play a second family member to fight alongside you. I tried a couple of coop runs with a friend, but that was when I was close to the end and thus a bit overpowered. It seems that there is no difficulty scaling to compensate for the fact that there are two of us, so the game got even easier in coop.

### Stats/Completion

I ended up playing a bit over 20 hours to finish the main story and do some extra achievements as well. However, I am stopping at 40/45 achievements done; I'm just not that interested anymore. There are some additional play modes that might make the game more interesting, like "Family Trials", which I think is some kind of survival mode where you have to do 30 stages in a row (sounds tedious), or New Game+, which supposedly ups the difficulty and increases level/upgrade caps and such, but I'm not sure I want to go through the story again.

### Overall

I got this one on sale, so I still think it was worth it. If you are new to roguelikes, it's probably good as an introduction to the genre, but I am a bit disappointed that it was not deeper than it turned out to be. Apparently it was well-received when it came out, but I can see why it hasn't really caught on that much.
