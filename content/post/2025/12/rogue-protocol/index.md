★★★★

It's nice where with each new book, we are introduced to a new type of AI that Murderbot reluctantly has to interact with. This time it's a "pet robot" who he finds quite annoying at first but who comes to think of him as a friend. And of course Murderbot once again manages to unexpectedly run into some humans that he begrudgingly ends up saving. He continues to be very relatable when he sighs and dives into trouble against all common sense.

Our overarching story inches forward again, and I am told that the first 4 books complete an arc. I think I'll wait a bit for the TV adaptation to cover at least those 4 books before watching it, but I am looking forward to seeing all the fight scenes happening and not just imagining them in my head.
