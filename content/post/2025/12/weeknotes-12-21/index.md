These weeknotes are coming in a day late because I had a busy and exhausting weekend.

### My Week

- **Medical Update**: I had a weird symptom appearing in routine tests lately. Nothing major, and certainly nothing I was feeling physically. A few weeks ago I finally saw a specialist about it and he ordered a bunch of tests to rule out some possible causes. And one of the potential causes was cancer. Given how much cancer had stressed our household during the past few years, that possibility did not amuse me. The tests took a couple of weeks to get back and as you can imagine it was a long two weeks of distracting myself so my anxiety doesn't take over and lots of prayers and more than one sleepless night. The results finally came back early last week, and I can happily report that **I do not have cancer**. I certainly breathed a sigh of relief. I spoke to the doctor later in the week and he said all the tests look good but that means the cause is still a mystery, but that we can do further tests in January, so at least I don't have to think about it again until next year.
- Luckily it was not hard to keep busy, given the Christmas rush. There was a lot to do, mostly helping the parents with some holiday stuff they wanted done. And this weekend we had an overnight family get-together which happily went by without incident. Next week promises to be even busier though!
- On the blog: Wrote reviews for [Rogue Protocol](/2025/12/rogue-protocol/) and [Children of Morta](/2025/12/children-of-morta/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): A little progress, mostly while waiting around for the doctor.
    - Comics: Falling behind quite a bit!
- Finished reading:
    - Rogue Protocol (Murderbot Diaries book 3)
- Feed reader backlog: 656 items as of this writing.

#### Watching

- Started: **Fallout S2**. Looks like this is a weekly drop, so it'll take a while to finish.
- Finished: 
    - **Boku No Hero Academia**. I gave up on trying to catch my backlog for this anime and since it was ending already, I just watched the last few episodes of the final battle and the epilogues. It was fine!
    - **Ranma 1/2 S2**. 
- Ongoing: **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break)
- Movies: No new movies watched this week.
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Lol this week I played a lot of brawl because I've been trying to get the limited-time winter achievements. Brawl games are so exhausting, they take forever!
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Only two achievements remain, but I need more crafting material to make the cards!
    - **Street Fighter 6**. Playing on and off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Finished: **Children of Morta** on Steam. Review linked above.
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3: Blood and Wine**. 
    - Ongoing: **Megaman Legacy Collection** - Finished Megaman 4 this past week and am already in the final stages of Megaman 5!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 65,639 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Not too bad, but I'm still likely to fall short by more than 200k steps from last year's total.

### Site Updates

- 2 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)

### Looking Forward

It's Christmas this coming week! Will probably be the busiest week of the year for us, I count at least 3 family get-togethers to attend (different subgroups and branches), plus lots of prep and such.
