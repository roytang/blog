These are the last weeknotes of the year! I hope the holidays have been good for you and yours. Here's to hoping we all get to 2026 safely!

### My Week

- The week went by quickly and was very busy, pretty much as expected. Four out of the seven days had extended family get-togethers and in between we had to deal with visits to some other friends and relatives and even a surprise visit from a cousin we didn't know would be back in the country for Christmas. It's always fun getting back together with family (and also kinda chaotic etc etc). There has been so much food and leftovers etc.
- On the blog: No extra blog posts this week.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): No progress this week.
    - Comics: Still quite behind.
- Feed reader backlog: 568 items as of this writing.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break)
- Movies: No new movies watched this week.
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Completed all the winter achievements! Now twiddling my thumbs waiting for ATLA quick draft to come back.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Finished all the Steam achievements!
    - **Street Fighter 6**. Playing on and off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3: Blood and Wine**. Not a lot of progress this week.
    - Ongoing: **Megaman Legacy Collection** - Finished Megaman 5 this past week and am already in the final stages of Megaman 6!
    - Started: **Marvel Cosmic Invasion**. A friend bought it on Steam and I have still not yet unsubbed from XBGP so I had access to it as well, and we are trying to power through the campaign. The final boss is really tough though!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 56,965 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). A bit disappointing that I did not manage to hit at least 60k this week, but kinda understandable given how busy the week was. Today however I am suffering from an upset stomach; not sure if it was something I ate last night. Hopefully it is fine by tomorrow.

### Looking Forward

It's the bonus week between Christmas and New Year's! Around this time I have to start prepping and writing my year-end posts and thoughts and stats and summaries and such and such. Luckily, the week looks so far to be clear of any appointments (though that can still change suddenly!), so hopefully I can get everything done. And on top of that of course I need to think about the usual end of month concerns, bills and such.
