It is December!

{{% collections-embed jokes 10156225261178912 %}}

### My Week

- I had to do some medical stuff this week, including taking some tests that may or may not reveal some bad news. Hoping for the best, but the results will take more than a week to get, so I'm a bit worried that the anxiety might get me first. It's the not knowing!! I'll try to keep distracting myself.
- The week was kind of busy. Lots of errands to run since a new month started. Also some stress due to Christmas events and helping some people get to this place or that. I did manage to sneak in some of my side projects and archival work though.
- On the blog: I [wrote about quitting Marvel Snap](/2025/12/quit-snap/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Rogue Protocol (Murderbot Diaries book 3)
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): I have been reading this on and off. Having it on the Kindle app on my phone is handy when I find myself in a dead spot (hospitals are full of those!), but progress is very slow.
- Feed reader backlog: 451 items as of this writing.

#### Watching

- Finished: **Superman The Animated Series**
- Started: **Justice League**. There was supposed to be a 1-season "New Batman Adventures" series in the same continuity as Batman TAS, but it's not on streaming for some reason, so I started the Justice League series first while I try to find a copy of TNBA.
- Ongoing: **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break), **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: No new movies watched this week.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: I did manage one trophy in ATLA draft already, so I am at least slightly improving.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Still just keeping up with the weekly chapters. 
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Children of Morta** on Steam. Tried coop mode with a friend!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 62,225 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I'm just happy I'm able to maintain 60k steps per week.

### Site Updates

- 5 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)

### Looking Forward

Still a bunch of blog posts I want to get written! I should at least note them down somewhere instead of just floating in my head.

I thought Fallout S2 was dropping this week, but turns out it's not until Dec 17.

I think the Game Awards are this week? 

Also MTG Worlds are happening this weekend, though I don't really follow the pro scene that closely anymore. I heard all the top decks are Izzet.

Tomorrow (Monday Dec 8) is a holiday and Catholic feast day over here.
