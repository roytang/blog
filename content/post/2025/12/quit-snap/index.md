title: I Quit Marvel Snap
toc: true
---

*(Look, it's my website, so I can announce departures if I want to.)*

Previously: [Marvel Snap (2022)](/2022/12/marvel-snap/)

I used to play Marvel Snap pretty heavily; I have almost 320 hours on the Steam version and god knows how many hours on the mobile version. It was very easy to just pull it out for a game or two when I'm waiting in the queue at the drugstore or whatever.

Today it has been around 7-8 weeks since I played an actual game of Marvel Snap, so I think I can declare a successful quitting of a live service game! Quitting turned out much easier than I had expected it to be. I have not yet uninstalled my installs though, I will do that after gathering data for this post. I was worried keeping it on my phone would be too tempting, but since then I only ever opened it maybe twice and that was just to see what new cards have been added, never actually playing a game.

I had gotten tired of the game and its very stingy economy. I didn't care too much for cosmetics, though I did craft a few ink/gold variants to look fancy. My real interest in the game was in the flavor and card design. As a big Marvel fan, it always amused me whenever they dug out some deep cut characters and how they designed the card abilities around those powers. A lot of times, it made no sense! But there are some that are excellent flavorwise. I was also interested in the card designs, but lately a lot of the newer cards felt very "more of the same" and had gotten a bit boring. 

Card acquisition and collecting everything was out of reach for an F2P gamer like me, but somehow I was able to muddle through all the seasons despite most of my cards being at least 2 seasons behind. When they switched away from the spotlight system to the new card packs, I only spent tokens on older cards since they were cheaper. Despite that, I never felt too behind the new meta decks and cards, despite some of them being quite overpowered. I think by that point the game had suffered from having a card pool that was too large. This was a problem that plagued MTG very early on and they quickly arrived at the solution of rotating formats. IDK if Snap will do something like that, might need a bunch of rework. The economy feels like it is being bled dry by the company, so I am not too optimistic about its longevity and the game might die before any big revamp like that.

Another thing I didn't like was the abundance of limited time events like *Deadpool's Diner* (I am bad at this mostly because I am bad at poker/gambling), *Sanctum Showdown* (probably the best of the LTEs, given how it changes the in-game incentives) and *High Voltage* (an occasionally fun but totally random nonsense generator). On their own these events were fine as an occasional change up from the ranked meta, but having them happen too often in succession felt like too much for me. They were always very time-intensive; they would have rewards that refresh every 8 hours so if you wanted to max out stuff as a F2P, you had to be playing almost constantly, and even then you might not even be able to get everything. Combined with wanting to rank up the ladder and doing conquest mode (which I mostly only did for the cosmetics), the game just demanded too much of my time.

All of this combined made the decision to quit easy. But that doesn't mean I can't look back and celebrate the things I enjoyed about the game!

### Playtime and Ranks

I started playing Marvel Snap in around October 2022 and quit in early October 2025, a period of just under three years (though there might have been a lull in the middle at some point though). When I started the season pass card was **Miles Morales Spider-Man**, a card that later on would just be an ordinary staple for move-based decks. Back then I didn't understand how battle passes work and was a bit frustrated at not being able to unlock the card!

In the 36 months or so that I played the game, it looks like I managed to hit Infinite rank a mere 4 times (AFAICT). This isn't too bad; the reward for hitting infinite rank is just a cosmetic that I would never have used anyway (I still have the default avatar, card back, etc), so most months I am content to hit 90 and stay there. Sometimes it's a struggle just to get to 90!

At some point, I managed to get all 3 of my brothers playing the game and we would be in the same Alliance together and so on. Sometimes we'd do some invite battles when they visit at home, and my nephew loves playing Snap on my phone and just tanking my rank! I think they have all already faded away from the game though, so I am the last one to quit the game in the family.

### Profile Stats

I was happy to find out this data was available from desktop version's local data files. (For reference, the data is from `%AppData%\LocalLow\Second Dinner\SNAP\Standalone\States\nvprod\ProfileState.json`)

- Name: "hungryroy"
- Tag: 34394
- Wins: 7078
- Losses: 5119
- Ties: 44
- AiGamesPlayed: 3
- Concedes: 1681
- OpponentConcedes: 2509
- Snaps: 6783

I'm happy to report that the above gives me a 57.82% win rate, which is quite a bit higher than [my MTG Arena Limited win rate](/page/stats/mtg/#arena-limited-stats), so I count that as a win.

### Collection Stats

- Collection level: 22971
- Series 1-3: Complete
- Series 4: 69.69% completion - 20 Unowned cards out of 66 available as of this writing.
- Series 5: 73.11% completion - 32 Unowned cards out of 119 currently available as of this writing.

Top 4 cards by number of variants:

1. Wolverine
2. Magneto
3. Colossus
4. Knull / Deadpool / Black Panther (tied)

Top 4 cards by infinity splits:

1. Knull
2. Storm
3. Shang Chi
4. Blade

Top 4 cards by mastery level:

1. Storm
2. Knull
3. Wolverine
4. Colossus

Top 4 cards by lifetime boosters earned:

*(This one is kind of a proxy for how much you play a card, since you earn boosters for cards in your deck after a match.)*

1. Knull
2. Shang Chi
3. Storm
4. Killmonger

Above "top 4" lists were generated using a modified version of [this script](https://github.com/MarvelSnapBoosters/Marvel-Snap-Booster-Count/blob/main/marvel_snap_booster_count.py). The modification was to add extraction of the mastery level data, since that wasn't available at the time the above script was written. Both the modified script and the raw CSV data are attached to this post:

### Decks

I have played many many decks throughout my three years of playing Snap. Most of them are no longer saved, likely due to balance changes and meta shifts and such. However, I have some "stock" decks that I played a lot and never removed from my list of decks, so sharing some here:

#### Destroy

{{% photos deckdestroy.png %}}

Deadpool-based Destroy was my first "real" deck; I used this a lot I think from 2023-2024. You can see it in how Knull is on all 4 of my "top 4" lists above. It's relatively easy to build: most of the core components are in series 1-3, though adding Knull and X-23 to the mix really push the power level. Nico Minoru is super versatile, serving both as sacrifice outlet, card draw, and possible location control. Also the deck loves it when there are "cloning" locations like Bar Sinister, as it lets you pull off insanely large Venoms and multiple Zola triggers. After Carnage and Venom, newer symbiote characters could no longer be destroy themed because adding even more destroy outlets would just make this deck stronger. I think in recent seasons it has become less viable, but it's a deck that's easy to come back to and has some fight in most metas.

#### Discard Collector

{{% photos deckdiscardcollector.png %}}

A classic and straightforward version of the discard archetype, and the one I was using the most early on. This one is even easier to build than Destroy; I think only Proxima Midnight is not series 1-3. The play lines are simple: use your discard effects to build up your board, with Swarm and Apocalypse effects buffing Collector. You want to end the game with big Modok, hopefully leaving a lone Apocalypse in hand to buff Dracula.

#### Bullseye

{{% photos deckbullseye.png %}}

Bullseye was released in mid-2025 and since then this was my go-to version of discard. It's a more combo-centric version of the deck, but still reliant on buffing Morbius (and now Miek) and Collector. You are aiming for a big turn 6 where you discard a bunch of Swarms and maybe Scorn to Modok and follow-up with a Bullseye activation for even more triggers. There's also the secondary combo of Daken + Armin Zola into the Bullseye activation to create massive Dakens. This deck is surprisingly resilient and I believe has never been nerfed too hard.

#### Move 

{{% photos deckmove.png %}}

Probably my least played among these stock decks. This was a typical Move configuration a while back, though I think it has changed a lot in 2025 because of balance changes and new move cards being added to the game. This deck can be challenging to play, because you need to think about how you're moving your pieces around well in advance, and it is also prone to being disrupted by some locations or clog strategies (basically anything that limits your movement space).

{{% resource-link src="deckmove.txt" %}}

#### Negative Jane

{{% photos decknegativejane.png %}}

I love this combo of using Mr Negative (hopefully on turn 3) to make a bunch of 0-cost cards in your deck that you then draw with Jane Foster Mighty Thor. You either finish with big a big turn 6 playing all those 0-drops. Usually something like Iron Man into Mystique, or Wong+Mystique into Ironheart, Sage and Taskmaster, or Gorr into Mystique into Taskmaster, etc. Lots of good end-game combinations. The downside to this deck though is that it doesn't always come together, and it's super obvious when it does so you have to time your snaps correctly to draw your opponent in, but only when you have a good chance to pull it off! (I am terrible at this kind of thing.)

{{% resource-link src="decknegativejane.txt" %}}

#### Others

Soooo many other decks that I've played that I didn't include above: Zoo/Ultron decks, Ongoing decks, Patriot decks, Surfer decks, Onslaught decks with REALLY BIG NUMBERS, Galactus decks (always fun to destroy the worlds!!), High Evo decks, Cerebro decks, Thanos decks, Arishem decks (fun for newer players!), Lockdown/Control, Mill, Clog, etc etc. It's kinda surprising to me how deep the pool of available decks could be given the relatively small card pool compared to other games.

### Recaps

Every so often Snap would let you generate recaps like your stats for the season. There were also sometimes annual recaps and other special ones (see below). These are just the ones I managed to save. In hindsight, I should have been generating these every chance I had, but I'm also not sure if they let you do that for every season.

### That's It For Marvel Snap!

Now that I've done this (kinda long) recap, I am uninstalling both the desktop and mobile versions of the game. Is there a chance I ever get back to it? I'd never say never, but it would need something big to bring me back; there's just too many other ways I want to spend my time.
