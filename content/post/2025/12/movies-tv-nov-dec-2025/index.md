Last reviews post of the year!!

### Movies

#### Blade (1998)

Watched on 2025-11-10: ★★★



{{% photos blade-1998 %}}

 Even as a Marvel comics fan, I was never particularly interested in Blade as a character, mostly because the traditional vampire mythos doesn't really interest me. This film did nothing to move that needle. Cool fight scenes though. And that 90s cgi!

#### Blade II (2002)

Watched on 2025-11-13: ★★★



{{% photos blade-ii-2002 %}}

 Maybe a tiny bit better than the original. Final face off with the guy was pretty good. 

Watching this trilogy in short order is like a history class of how quickly CGI was evolving during that era.

#### Blade: Trinity (2004)

Watched on 2025-11-14: ★★★½



{{% photos blade-trinity-2004 %}}

 This was the only one of the trilogy where I didn't need more than one day to finish it, and I swear it's not just because of Jessica Biel. Blade hanging with a younger crowd was just more interesting, and even though Ryan Reynolds was pretty much just playing himself, I appreciate Blade having a comic foil/ally. Also, Dominic Purcell as Dracula wut!

#### A House of Dynamite (2025)

Watched on 2025-11-15: ★★★★★



{{% photos a-house-of-dynamite-2025 %}}

 The storytelling here mainly revolves how all of these people are coming to the sudden realization that this unthinkable thing is real and it's happening and nobody knows why and there's nothing they can do. Everyone deals with the crisis differently, but in the end they all still have jobs to do and try their best under the circumstances. 

I was maybe halfway through this film when I realized it was going to be one of those where we never get any answers as to who caused the instigating event or what the consequences are, and normally I hate that kind of thing (because I need some resolution in my life), but this was just so well done I didn't mind. 

The story is mainly told in three parts, each covering a different group of people whose roles intersect throughout the event. So if you're a Rebecca Ferguson fan for example, she's only in like a third of this film. Idris Elba speaks for the first 2/3s but only appears on-screen in the final third.

#### A Working Man (2025)

Watched on 2025-11-18: ★★★



{{% photos a-working-man-2025 %}}

 This is a very straightforward Statham action movie; you know what to expect and it more or less delivers. My main complaint is that it has probably the most incompetent portrayal of Russian mafia I've ever seen. For that reason, I rate it a bit worse than the last Statham+Ayer teamup (Beekeeper)

#### The Theory of Everything (2014)

Watched on 2025-11-22: ★★★★



{{% photos the-theory-of-everything-2014 %}}

 I honestly thought there'd be more physics in this but apparently it is based on the biography by Jane Hawking, so it focuses more on her relationship with Stephen Hawking over three decades amidst his rising fame and the difficulties of his disease.

The performances by the leads are very good. Eddie Redmayne's gradual transformation into how the IRL Hawking looks like (as I remember him) is fantastic. And I kind of want to see more Felicity Jones performances.

I thought I would get mad at Charlie Cox's character when he was introduced, but honestly the guy's a saint and so is Jane Hawking, having to deal with everything over all those many years. The Wikipedia page says the film has taken liberties with how nonconfrontational the eventual breakup/divorce was, which is a bit sad, but I can understand how the adapted version might have worked out better for the film's narrative. (And Hawking was still alive when it came out, so I imagine they didn't want to upset him lol)

The story covers 30 years, and things happen quickly and sometimes it's not exactly clear how much time has passed by between scenes. At the start, Stephen is given 2 years to live, but soon they clearly pass that time by without acknowledging it. It looks like they fudged the timeline of some of the later events, so maybe that made it harder to clearly indicate when things were happening?

#### 21 Jump Street (2012)

Watched on 2025-11-29: ★★★★



{{% photos 21-jump-street-2012 %}}

 I was looking for a stupid movie to queue up in the background while I was doing other stuff and I had never seen this one before it fit the bill. While it is objectively a stupid movie with stupid protagonists, it also turned out to quite funny and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. I like how they did the inversion of nerd/jock roles during the undercover, and that Johnny Depp cameo near the end was surprisingly good.

#### Wake Up Dead Man (2025)

Watched on 2025-12-13: ★★★★★



{{% photos wake-up-dead-man-2025 %}}

 I don't think any of the sequels could ever match the original for me, but this was still pretty good. Being Catholic might have helped. I kind of guessed the final culprit from the very start, but I had the wrong actor name in my head. Daniel Craig's Benoit Blanc continues to be great; if this series goes on much longer, Blanc may top Bond as his most iconic character.

#### Weapons (2025)

Watched on 2025-12-13: ★★★★★



{{% photos weapons-2025 %}}

 I am not big on horror movies, mostly because I dislike jump scares, so I am happy to report not a lot in this one. I watched this because I heard good things, but went in mostly blind except for the initial premise. There is a lot of buildup and at first I was worried it would be one of those films where the mystery is never fully explained, but thankfully things started picking up after the halfway point, and the final explanation was honestly less creepy than I thought it would be.

I am bothered by the idea that there is like an inept cop in their town wandering around on patrol without a partner though! Why?!?

From the start I was wondering where I recognized the lead woman from and turns out she was Silver Surfer in FF:First Steps. She had a good 2025!

#### One Battle After Another (2025)

Watched on 2025-12-29: ★★★★★



{{% photos one-battle-after-another-2025 %}}

 I watched the entire film and only realized afterwards that one guy was actually Sean Penn. The film lives up to it's title, it just keeps going and very rarely lets up. The story is very intense, tackling revolutionary resistance groups and white supremacy and what not. There are some fantastic performances and some great shots in there that even I can appreciate. I found it superbly entertaining.

### TV

#### The Diplomat S3

Finished watching on 2025-11-05: ★★★★

This was apparently the only non-animated show I watched during the past 2 months! I figured Kate and Hal might be screwed since they pissed off Grace Penn who in a surprise twist at the end of season 2 suddenly became the US president.

The show remains very intense. I am amused by Kate this season because {{% spoiler %}} she would rather stay in London to deal with the horrible PM rather than go live a chill ceremonious life in the US because she doesn't want to deal with Hal. {{% /spoiler %}} Despite everything, Kate remains the one truly earnest character in a sea of horribly flawed people, just simply trying her best to do her duty to her country.

I am once again glad this season did not end with too much of a cliffhanger.

#### Superman the Animated Series

Finished watching on 2025-12-07: ★★★★

I loved the DCAU Batman:TAS and Justice League series back in the 90s, but somehow never got into this one, so I decided to finally watch it. All the classic Superman stories and villains are here, but surprisingly the series never sees Lex turn full outright wanted criminal, and they never push the Clark/Lois romance (I forget if Lois ever finds out about Clark in JL). Notably, this Superman is of a noticeably lower power level than modern comics Superman; he flinches from machine gun hits and struggles lifting anything that's too large and so on. It makes for more interesting fights at least. I suspect James Gunn's recent Superman movie (which would sometimes be criticized for the low power level of the hero) at least partially based the power level on this series.

This series was 3 seasons long, and does a lot to set up the eventual Justice League series, even featuring appearances by other heroes such as Flash, Green Lantern and Doctor Fate. My favorite part is the 3-episode "World's Finest" story which has Bruce/Batman and Clark/Superman meeting each other for the first time (and almost immediately figuring out each other's identity!)

This series (and the next entry) are still good background watching, but the pace is noticeably slower than modern-day adventure shows, a relic of its time.

#### The New Batman Adventures

Finished watching: 2025-12-14: ★★★★

After watching Superman:TAS, I found out there was an additional season of Batman:TAS continuity titled "The New Batman Adventures". The characters have been a bit redesigned to closer follow the Superman:TAS style. While it's still primarily about Batman, there is a stronger focus on other characters as well. Tim Drake is introduced as the new Robin, Dick Grayson details how he became Nightwing, and there's even an episode where Batgirl and Supergirl team-up! All good fun.

#### Boku No Hero Academia

Finished watching on 2025-12-19: ★★★★

I think I last watched this anime a couple of major arcs ago, but after [the manga finished](/2025/04/2025-manga-update/#my-hero-academia) I knew I wanted to see that final battle animated, so I am cheating a bit here and just skipping to the last few episodes to see the final bits and the epilogue. The final battle was well animated and I'm glad I got to see it. While some criticized Deku's ending, I felt it was appropriate and overall a good ending for the series.

#### Ranma 1/2 S2

Finished watching on 2025-12-22: ★★★★

The series continues to remain very faithful to the source material, and Takahashi's humor continues to be timeless.

### That's It!

I'll do yearend movie/TV wrapups in my yearnotes post soon!
