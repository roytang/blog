### My Week

- Mostly trying to keep busy, to keep myself from thinking too hard about the lab results and potential  bad news I might get in a few days. It might all still be nothing of course, and if so I will breathe a heavy sigh of relief. 
- I had an additional medical test that had to be done in addition to the ones from the previous week. I wanted to do it before, but was told it was only done on certain days and I had to come back Monday morning. Except Monday was a holiday, so when I got there they had me come back on Thursday. Welp. Finally got it done though! 
- Also did some Philhealth business I've been putting off for a while. Found out that premiums are so high these days! No wonder everyone is complaining. Went to Trinoma afterwards, found out the North Ave exit has been sealed off and the alternative exit they provide actually comes out at EDSA and has a long walk back to North Ave. Not good for accessibility; I can't take my mom through that route!
- On the blog: No extra blog posts this week.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Rogue Protocol (Murderbot Diaries book 3): A little progress.
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): No progress.
    - Comics: Barely keeping up.
- Feed reader backlog: 572 items as of this writing.

#### Watching

- Binged: **The New Batman Adventures**. After finishing Superman TAS last week, I was surprised to find out there was an additional season of Batman TAS with revised animations released before Justice League. I got myself a copy and watched through it this past week.
- Ongoing: **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break), **Ranma 1/2 S2**.
- Movies: Watched [Wake Up Dead Man (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/wake-up-dead-man/) and [Weapons (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/weapons-2025/).

#### Gaming

- I watched the Game Awards Friday morning local time. Actually the first time I've ever watched this show. Some notes:
    - None of the game announcements were particularly interesting (the ones I might play were just too far out); the most exciting thing for me was the Street Fighter movie cast appearance.
    - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 won Game of the Year and a bunch of other awards, unsurprisingly. I felt a bit for other nominees this year because they were just up against a juggernaut! Poor Silksong!
    - I really liked the orchestra performance of the nominees' soundtracks, especially that one flute guy who looked really intense! Apparently he's been a staple of this show and [the community loves him](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pki7qy/the_best_part_of_the_game_awards_pedro_eustache/)!
- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Just building up currency until ATLA quick draft comes back. I've been running the new Izzet Lessons deck in Standard, but it seems like people are really building against it!
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Keeping up with the weekly chapters, plus grinding out the game's many achievements! I only have 7 more remaining, but those are mostly the tough ones.
    - Started: **Street Fighter 6**. I stopped playing this for a while earlier this year mostly because I was achievement complete and my arcade stick was having driver problems, but I've gotten back into it because of the Steam Deck. The Steam Deck is really handy for playing a match or two in bed without getting up!
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Children of Morta** on Steam. I already finished the main story for this so my activity has kind of tapered off. I still have a few achievements to grind out (including one that requires co-op), but if I don't feel like it I'll just be done with the game and write the review already.
    - Started: **Witcher 3: Blood and Wine**. The Witcher 3 DLCs have been on my backlog forever, but this being the 10th anniversary of the game and the sequel already being worked on, I figured I might as well work on them already. I had previously finished the main game on PS4 back in 2015 and thought I finished the Steam version earlier this year, but turns out I did that back in 2023! Time, how does it work?
    - Started: **Megaman Legacy Collection** - Megaman 3. I already finished the first 2 games in this collection a while back, but was looking for a platformer to pick up on the Steam Deck, and following the Game Awards announcement of a new Megaman game in the works I decided to resume with Megaman 3! Again, the Steam Deck makes it easy to pick up and play through a level or two whenever you feel like it.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 61,676 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Sunday and Saturday were the partials. The walks are always good to soothe my soul and help me work through my anxieties.

### Site Updates

- 3 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)
- some minor updates to older entries in some [collections](/collections/)

### Looking Forward

Either I get good news or a sigh of relief in a few days!

Fallout S2 should be dropping this coming week.

Still a bunch of blog posts I want to get written! I need to write more, but not until I get out of my own head!

This coming week is the last one before Christmas, so things will be getting really busy for us, as this season we always have more and more family get-togethers and other events to attend. In fact, next week's weeknotes will likely be delayed.
