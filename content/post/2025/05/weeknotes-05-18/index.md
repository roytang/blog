### The World

We had mid-term elections over here this past week. I [wrote a blog post about it](/2025/05/elections-2025/).

### My Week

We had a visit from a childhood family friend that I kinda grew up with. My dad kind of had a falling out with his dad but then so did he so it kind of ended up being both a nostalgia trip and an emotional dumping session that lasted way too long. Always good to reconnect with people I guess.

Trivia team [attended quiz night at a new venue last Thursday and we won](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-games)!

On the blog: Wrote about the elections (linked above) and also [yet another very long complete marvel run post that probably only I am interested in](/2025/05/cmr-cap2/)!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Focusing on catching up with recent comics at the moment, not yet sure what to cover next for the marvel run.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Doctor Who S1**, **The Simpsons**, 
- Finished: **Andor S2** (so good, I [already wrote some words already on Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/users/roytang/statuses/114507324383988787) that I will probably incorporate when I review it for the blog) and **The Pitt** (so good and so tragic!)
- Movies: No new movies this week! I did a Rogue One rewatch after the Andor finale but I don't think I have enough new opinions on it to warrant a new review. 

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Down to my last few Tarkir: Dragonstorm drafts, still not doing very well. 
- Single-player games: 
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: Finished Act 2 a couple of days ago!
    - **Blue Prince**: Still so much left to uncover!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 51,643 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). I missed out on a couple of days mostly because they were very rainy in the afternoon and evening when I usually do my walking. The rest of the week was mostly still quite hot.

Not a lot today.

    > "Generative AI, or, to be more precise, the stuff we get sold as AI¹, is bad. It’s bad for the environment. It steals from everyone without asking. It’s wrong in very strange ways half of the time, we have no idea how it actually works and it’s controlled by billionaires. Some of this might change, even though I don’t think it will. But one thing will stay the same: AI is like frozen pizza."

### Looking Forward

Trying to make a list of upcoming releases I am looking forward to, not much else in May I think (or maybe I'm forgetting some things?):

- Jun 24 Ironheart
- Jul 11 Superman
- Jul 17 Strange New Worlds S3
- Jul 25 Fantastic Four: First Steps

I think new Mission Impossible is already out, but I already spent money on the cinema this week, not sure I wanna do it again.

On the errands side, we have some regular screening procedures for patient#1 this week, but that shouldn't be too problematic.

Not sure if we are attending another quiz night this week.
