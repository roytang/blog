### The World

The Wheel of Time turns, and June is almost upon us. 

There will not be another cycle of Amazon's Wheel of Time show though; the show has been cancelled after season 3. Not surprising, but still disappointing, as the series had just hit it's stride.

### My Week

Most of Monday was spent with Patient#1 for one of her regularly-scheduled maintenance procedures. Nothing too stressful, except we were stuck in the hospital for most of the day. The procedure itself took less than an hour, it's just that there was so much waiting involved!

The earpads of [my gaming headset](/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/) started falling apart early this week; I was quickly able to order replacements off Lazada, but this is actually already the second time I've had to replace them. The previous ones lasted under two years. I do wish these things lasted longer.

I (think I) managed to unclog a toilet drain this week! Still observing if it has any problems.

Attended [a quiz night with my HS batchmates this weekend, and we did terribly](/2025/05/pisay-b2k-quiz/)!

On the blog: Nothing extra this past week, but I got something cooking up!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Focusing on catching up with recent comics for now, but the next [CMR](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post should be about Thor I think.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. I think I am stuck somewhere near the first 20% of the book; I may end up reading only this one book for the year!

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Doctor Who S2**, **The Simpsons**, 
- Finished: **Doctor Who S1**. 
- Movies: No new movies this week! 
- Not a lot watched in May in terms of TV/movies, so I think I won't have a reviews post for this month and will just have a two-fer in June?

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. I am done drafting Tarkir Dragonstorm and need to save up for the upcoming Final Fantasy set on Arena. I should write a set recap for TDM soon; spoiler alert: my win rate for this set was pretty bad!
- Single-player games: 
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: Finished the main story early this week! Now wandering around doing extra / post-game stuff.
    - **Blue Prince**: Still so much left to uncover! I really should make a list of all the unsolved mysteries I still need to figure out in this game!
    - Found out that **Metaphor Re:Fantazio** is dropping on PC Game Pass next week and my first reaction was "ANOTHER ONE?!? I DON'T HAVE TIME TO PLAY ALL THESE GREAT GAMES!!" First-world problem I suppose.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 62,678 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Not 70k, but still pretty good. Honestly anything above 60k steps is a good week, although 70k would be ideal. The weather has been quite hot this week and we had very little rain; I guess that made it easier to walk, but the days are suffering.

I have been kind of trying to split my sleep between 4-5 hours overnight and maybe 2-3 hours in the afternoon. That way I can sleep in the airconditioned room when the heat is at its peak! I have enough trouble controlling my regular sleep cycle though, so this is a challenge as well. (Not to mention potential scheduling issues!)

    Lol this is great and brings back memories of all the ridiculous tech issues I've encountered in past projects and makes me wish I had documented them similarly!

    > 'Lately, it feels like some of you aren’t the techno-optimists I took you to be. You’ve been heard uttering slurs like “I’m worried about my job stability” and “I just don’t think it’s positive for humankind,” neither of which sounds remotely optimistic or techno. I’ve even heard shocking reports of teams failing to incorporate plagiarism into their processes, because—I can’t believe I have to repeat this—“it’s not helpful.”'

    > "The starting point was the desktop/laptop that everyone was familiar with. Ethan Marcotte's brilliant insight was to jettison that thinking and, instead, tackle the problem from an entirely new perspective: mobile first. Assume you have a small screen and create a linear presentation. If you have more horizontal space, let your design flow to fill it. That's it. That's Responsive Web Design."

    > "Most people don’t get to say no. Not really. They’re not debating whether to use AI on principle. They’re trying to figure out how to keep their job without surrendering their judgment or drowning in tasks that keep multiplying while headcount shrinks. "

    > "The real threat to creativity isn’t a language model. It’s a workplace that rewards speed over depth, scale over care, automation over meaning. If we’re going to talk about what robs people of agency, let’s start there. Let’s talk about the economic structures that pressure people into using tools badly, or in ways that betray their values."

### Looking Forward

Upcoming releases I am looking forward to:
