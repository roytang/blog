title: PH Elections 2025
---

Yesterday was mid-term elections here in the PH. At stake: 12 senatorial slots and the usual slate of local positions.

### The Run-Up and the Stakes

I wasn't too invested in this one; that is, I wasn't following the news and the campaign too closely, though it's hard to get away from the plethora of TV ads and campaign posters and what-not. 

Usually midterms feel a bit lower stakes than the presidentials, but this time on the line was VP Sara Duterte's impeachment trial taking place in June I think? The 12 senators to be elected would be standing as jurors in the impeachment, so the election of allied (or not allied) senators would affect the outcome.

I was a bit worried about our voter registration because [COMELEC's precint finder](https://precinctfinder.comelec.gov.ph/voter_precinct) was giving me some "duplicate record" errors:

My mom's record had the same problem. And I couldn't even find the record for my dad! Well, it was too late to figure this out, so the plan was just to go there on election day and hope for the best. Honestly it's not surprising that the COMELEC's data isn't all cleaned up.

### Election Day and My Ballot

The night before the elections, I found out that there was a special slot for seniors to vote from 5am to 7am, so my mom and I decided to wake up early so I could go with her to take advantage of that special slot. My dad would go vote in the afternoon.

We got there before 6am, and there were already a lot of people, mostly seniors. There was a priority polling precinct right on the ground floor so that seniors didn't have to go to their own precinct rooms to vote; convenient especially if the precinct rooms are on the 2nd or 3rd floors. I left my mom in the queue there while I went to get our actual precinct data (since I hadn't gotten it from the precinct finder) and it was also on the first floor. I checked it out and the queue was much shorter there so I moved my mom there and soon we had voted. We were done in under 45 minutes I think.

Turns out the problems with the precinct finder weren't relevant. Props to the Comelec this year for these measures (early voting slot and priority precinct) to make it easier for seniors to vote!

As for my actual ballot, I will admit I mostly only had Bam Aquino, Kiko P, Heidi M, and Luke E in mind for the senatorial slots. I cribbed the remainder of the ticket (mostly progressive candidates) from someone online, here's who I ended up with:

| Senators | | |
|---|---|---|
| 05 | Bam Aquino | (Education) |
| 06 | Ronnel Arambulo | (Agriculture & Fishermen Rights) |
| 08 | Roberto Ballon | (Environment) |
| 13 | Arlene Brosas | (Women & Child Welfare, LGBTQIA+ rights) |
| 16 | Teddy Casiño | (Human Rights) |
| 21 | Leody De Guzman | (Labor & Human Rights) |
| 25 | Luke Espiritu | (Law & Labor Rights) |
| 43 | Sonny Matula | (Workers Right) |
| 44 | Liza Maza | (Women’s Rights and Social Justice) |
| 45 | Heidi Mendoza | (Auditing & Anti Corruption) |
| 51 | Kiko Pangilinan | (Food & Agriculture) |
| 54 | Danilo Ramos | (Agriculture & Farmers Rights) |
| **Party-List** |
| 51 | Akbayan |

Admittedly, most of these progressive candidates are unlikely to place; I have long since accepted that my tastes (which seemingly become even more progressive as time goes on) do not much the popular sentiment in our country where too many voters rely on name recall and tribal loyalties and conservative views.

(Also, I am mildly annoyed at anyone who posts their senatorial choices but doesn't sort them using the conveniently provided numeric key!)

For the local seats, Mayor Joy Belmonte and her SBP slate were running virtually unopposed and their performance has been fine, so I just voted for them all.

### Results

The results are mostly in (unofficial for now of course) and while my low expectations of the PH electorate are mostly fulfilled with big ad spenders (and Sara Duterte allies) Camille Villar and Imee Marcos squeaking into the top 12, there are also some pleasant surprises:

- Bam Aquino and Kiko Pangilinan making it into the top 5 of the senatorial ranks, even though surveys had them languishing on the cusp. At least Senator Risa Hontiveros now has some help as the true opposition in the senate!
- The rest of the progressives didn't make it, but they had some good showings, gaining more national votes than they had before. There had been some discourse on Reddit about "voting strategically" for people like Abalos or Pacquiao, to try to knock Duterte allies like Villar and Marcos out of the top 12 to ensure Sara's impeachment, instead of "wasting" votes on these progressives who don't have a chance of winning. But I think voting your principles matters, and every improvement in the national standings of progressive candidates like Heidi Mendoza (got more votes than Willie Revillame!) and Luke Espiritu (still in the top 30) gives them a better idea of how much of a base they have built and a bit more push to fight harder in the future. I'd rather still follow my conscience rather than the strategic voting which may or may not work. Honestly if Sara Duterte avoids impeachment because of the electorate's choices, then that's something the electorate deserves. (My cynicism about the electorate still shines through.)
- Akbayan tops the party-list ranks, so that's Chel Diokno in congress at least, and I think De Lima is in as well.
- Also, Cynthia Villar didn't even win her local race in Las Pinas. I really shouldn't care about it, but I found myself cackling a bit at the idea.

The results do show how influential former president Duterte still is though, with Bong Go and Bato dela Rosa (who offers practically nothing else than his loyalty to Duts) in the top ranks. At least Quiboloy is languishing in the outside ranks and can't use the Senate to hide from the FBI!

That's it for this year! I don't know if I will be a bit more invested in the presidentials in three years; it probably depends on who the opposition decides to field. It feels like Leni's energy in 2022 was hard to top yet the outcome was still disappointing, so we shall see.
