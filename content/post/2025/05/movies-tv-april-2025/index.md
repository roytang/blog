My [previous post](/2025/04/movies-tv-1q/) covered three months worth of TV and movies and felt too long. Let's see how one month's worth feels.

### Movies

This month I watched mostly animated stuff, Superman rewatches (in anticipation of James Gunn's film!) and Gene Hackman.

#### Ponyo (2008)

Watched on 2025-04-01: ★★★★



{{% photos ponyo-2008 %}}

 Watched this with the nieces and nephews so I was kinda distracted and I'm sure I missed a lot of key details, but the story seemed straightforward and the animation was very pretty though the waves that looked like fish were incredibly odd. Had a very whimsical fantasy feel to it.

#### Zootopia (2016)

Watched on 2025-04-04: ★★★★½

 This was very good and a fun ride, designed to break down stereotypes. That being said, I wonder if it would get some pushback in the current environment from the anti-inclusivity crowd.

 This was a great heart-warming animated movie for all ages.

#### Superman (1978)

Watched on 2025-04-18: ★★★★



{{% photos superman-1978 %}}

 (Rewatch) I've seen 1 and 2 multiple times and these are classic films for me, though I think I've never seen them in the cinema. The special effects are products of their time of course, and the pacing is a far cry from modern superhero movies. Much more time is spent during the opening scenes on Krypton than I remember, and it is more than 30 minutes before Clark even makes it out of Smallville. Lots of inconsistencies in the details of \*when\* Krypton exploded. Luthor's plan is ridiculous and of course easily thwarted. Superman able to rewind time is such a pre-crisis thing.

#### Superman II (1980)

Watched on 2025-04-19: ★★★★



{{% photos superman-ii-1980 %}}

 (Rewatch) It was only during this most recent rewatch that I found out that 75% of this movie was filmed at the same time as the first one, which explains why they had the audacity to spend so much time in the intro to the first movie depicting the banishment of Zod and his allies, a plot device that would not pay off until this second film two years later. Another classic film, yet of course the special effects seem quaint and ridiculous in this modern age. Especially if you compare the Zod fights with Man of Steel for example! The fights here are much less physical, with the trio relying a lot on their heat visions and breath attacks. The twist with the chamber at the end was executed well, and Zod's hand suddenly crushed after Clark reveals his plan was great. In the end, Superman takes away Lois' memory with a kiss (Not the last time he would do this!), yet another pre-crisis power apparently.

#### Superman III (1983)

Watched on 2025-04-19: ★★★½



{{% photos superman-iii-1983 %}}

 (Rewatch.) I suspect this is the first time I have ever rewatched this one in full, though when I was a kid, I had a copy of the comic book adaptation for this one which I read many times, and the adaptation was fairly accurate, so I know the story inside and out. This is the one where I first learned of Salami Slicing, and only one of two Richard Pryor films I have ever seen. While I was watching, my mom recognized the actor for Ross Webster as The Man from UNCLE! She wondered why I didn't know him and I pointed out I wasn't even alive when that series was out. That scene near the end of Vera Webster being absorbed by the machine and converted into a cyborg really creeped me out as a kid. Overall a much sillier installment (I still laugh every time at that vendor selling Leaning Tower merch), fun but not as classic as the first two.

#### Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987)

Watched on 2025-04-26: ★★½



{{% photos superman-iv-the-quest-for-peace-1987 %}}

 (Rewatch.) I believe this is the only one of the Reeves films I actually saw in the cinema, as I was too young for the others. It is the first time I have rewatched it and it is also the worst and most ridiculous of the set. I mean, the main plot involved Luthor growing an entire supervillain from a strand of Superman's hair after tricking Superman into hurling it into the sun! And the Nuclear Man doesn't even work outside of sunlight! No batteries at all! During their battle, Superman uses his eye beams to REPAIR THE GREAT WALL OF CHINA! I gestured and said WHAT THE HELL out loud lol. This isn't even the pre-crisis era anymore! Surprised to find out that Jon Cryer played Luthor's nephew Lenny (he would later play Lex himself in the CW Supergirl TV series!). A sad end to Reeves' Superman legacy.

#### The French Connection (1971)

Watched on 2025-04-26: ★★★★



{{% photos the-french-connection-1971 %}}

 Been meaning to watch this for a while, but seemed appropriate after Gene Hackman had passed away. It's a bit difficult to imagine given the limits of filmmaking at the time, but I imagine this was the equivalent of "Heat" for the period. Hackman's Popeye Doyle is a tough, no-nonsense cop, and there is a lot of police brutality and casual racism thrown around (definitely a product of its time). That whole sequence where Doyle chases an elevated train through the streets of Brooklyn was intense, and I read that they didn't even have a permit to film that!

#### Thunderbolts* (2025)

Watched on 2025-05-01: ★★★★

(I put an * after "April" in the post title because while this one was technically an April release, I actually watched it in May, but it's my blog post I can do what I want!)

{{% photos thunderbolts-2025 %}}

 This was a fine Marvel movie and a good return to form, though I must admit the really good early reviews did hype me up a bit too much. Florence Pugh's Yelena is pretty much the MC of this ensemble, and that means she gets the much more serious character arc as the story is unexpectedly poignant, tackling a challenging theme yet somehow executing it well.

It does mean we get much less of funny/witty Yelena, which is a bit of a disappointment, but Red Guardian and the rest of the "team" provide an appropriate level of comedy to lighten the mood a bit. And their chemistry is excellent! The action is good, and the pacing is excellent - things are moving along constantly with very little dead time. I was mostly expecting the big conflict to end how it did, given the characters involved, but it was well-done. Val is an excellent recurring "villain" for the MCU,and the final main sequence and the last (second) post-credits scene will be really good for the ones who are looking for all the juicy MCU teases. 

Out of this year's MCU releases, I had the least expectations for this one, and it would be a big surprise if this ends up being the best one!

### TV

#### The Residence

Watched this one because it was referenced in a quiz night. This one is pretty clever, though the use of constantly shifting timelines and perspectives are a bit annoying at least at first and the constant birding references can be a bit much. There are a lot of meta murder mystery references, and at some point I considered whether this mystery would end in a "Murder on the Orient Express" type of reveal, and a couple of episodes later, the show itself promptly referenced that idea and smacked it down without missing a beat, as if reading my mind. It's not one of those things where the audience could be expected to figure things out themselves (the main character didn't know the culprit until the very end!) but in hindsight, the eventual culprit was super unlikeable anyway so maybe they wanted to lead us there after all? I binged all 8 episodes in 2 days so yeah, you could say I enjoyed it.

#### Daredevil Born Again S1

We certainly want to make comparisons to the original Netflix series and the question is does it live up to that? I will say Born Again is good, but I'm not sure it's there yet. Mainly because we didn't get a complete story line for season 1 and very little actual Daredevil, and Muse was much less of a threat than he was in the comics. I will say the Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk performances are still fantastic, even though a lot of the time they are just chewing the fat, but the sheer atmosphere around the two actors is great, especially when they are sharing the same scenes. It was a bit obvious in some parts that there were heavy edits and reshoots to make the story work. I was very surprised by the events of the first episode, and not at all surprised by where we are headed by the end of the season and I am still very much looking forward to the next one.

#### Wheel of Time S3

While S1 of the show wasn't great, each successive season has gotten much better and more book accurate even. Though for this one, they decided to change up the sequence and have Rand head to the Aiel Waste before going to Tear for Callandar (events that happened in books 4 and 3 respectively). I really liked the portrayals of the flashbacks to the Age of Legends and the Breaking of the World and Rand's trip through his ancestry at Rhuidean; these were all things whose details I don't really remember anymore (it has been almost 30 years since I first read the books!) and I am glad to be able to visualize them in this way. There's a bunch of changes, including deaths that didn't happen in the books but I kind of understand because they need to trim the fat for the remainder of the series; it is a VERY LONG series that would otherwise never find a good enough adaptation. I am a bit worried because there is still so much ground to cover to get to book 14 and I think it is highly unlikely Amazon will give them budget for 9-10 more seasons of this (though I am pretty sure the last 6-7 books can be compressed A LOT). Hoping they can get there somehow!

#### Abbot Elementary S4

Pretty entertaining and they have a crossover episode with Always Sunny this season, but still mostly a background watch for me.
