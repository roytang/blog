### The World

We have a new pope: Pope Leo XIV, a native of Chicago, the first American-born pope!

Tomorrow is election day over in these parts; the last week or so we have seen a slew of increasing campaigning activities on the streets from local candidates, and very many tv ads from national candidates. My mom is complaining that she only gets 5 minutes of her favorite *teleserye* for every 15 minutes of political ads!

I am not super invested in this year's elections, though I do still want to do my civic duty. I probably won't have a complete slate. I checked COMELEC's [precinct finder](https://precinctfinder.comelec.gov.ph/voter_precinct) for my details and it tells me "There is another voter with the same full name and birth date as yours in the city/municipality where you are registered. These multiple records may belong to you or to another different voter. We cannot be certain unless you provide us with more information." So the plan tomorrow is just go and hope for the best!

### My Week

Lots of household chores for me this week. Little progress on my other stuff. Was at home for most of the week, though Saturday I accompanied my dad on an expedition to his favorite shoe name brand outlet which was having a one-day buy one take one sale and it reminded me why I dislike going to these big sales. You get good discounts sure, but you're also tired and exhausted and there are so many people and we spent FOUR HOURS in line at the cashier and had an adventure trying to get home.

On the blog: Nothing extra last week. I am writing some WIP posts I swear!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: All the Captain America comics are done, trying to catch up with the more recent comics. Still not sure what direction to take the Marvel run to next.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Doctor Who S1**, **The Simpsons**, **Andor S2**
- Started watching: **The Pitt**. Kinda stressful and sad and all that, but entertaining. I think I am already halfway through the season.
- Movies: No new movies this week!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Resumed drafting Tarkir: Dragonstorm this weekend, still not doing very well. Final Fantasy MTG previews started last night, and everything looks great! I also randomly played some **Marvel Rivals** this week for some reason.
- Single-player games: 
    - **Blue Prince**: Not playing this as regularly as I used to, but there still seem to be sooo many secrets left to uncover.
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: I am probably almost 20h into this one. It continues to be very good.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 63,006 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), slightly below last week's total, but that's fine. It was kind of a rainy week actually, which was a welcome respite from the scorching heat (though we got some additional humidity in exchange). It seems this coming week is gonna be pretty hot again though. =/

There are situations where the only thing that matters is that a task gets accomplished quickly; in those cases, doing it manually can make sense! But a lot of the time, trying to automate builds skill and capability that will come in handy later."

### Looking Forward

Elections tomorrow!

Andor series finale this Wednesday! Last week's arc was great and I am probably going to rewatch Rogue One as soon as I finish the final ep.
