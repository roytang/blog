Somehow, it is May. PH elections are two Mondays from now, I am not prepared.

Today is also Star Wars Day. Yesterday was Free Comic Book Day. Neither of these things have affected me.

### My Week

The person who has been coming in occasionally to help us with household work had to go home to the province for a couple of weeks to vote in the upcoming elections, so we are without a helper for a while and I have to once again pick up more work at home. 

I did have occasion to go out and go to the mall this week, to watch [Thunderbolts*](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/thunderbolts/). IMAX and regular cinema prices remain quite high, so despite going on a holiday and there being lots of people at the mall, we had no worries that we would run out of seats.

The rest of my week was the usual end-of-month errands, paying bills, making sure all my affairs are in order yada yada yada. A bit of productivity on my usual side project and decluttering efforts, though I notice that productivity tends to wane towards the end of the week (which I suppose is typical even for office productivity).

On the blog: [I Just Want To See What Happens Next](/2025/04/what-happens-next/) and [Movies / TV for Apr* 2025](/2025/05/movies-tv-april-2025/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Am behind on writing a new Marvel post, though the comics in-scope are already (almost) done being read.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Doctor Who S1**, **The Simpsons**, **Andor S2**
- Movies: Watched [Thunderbolts* (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/thunderbolts/) and [The Burial (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-burial/). My letterboxd reviews are up-to-date again!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then. Still drafting Tarkir: Dragonstorm, still not doing very well. 
- Single-player games: 
    - **Blue Prince**: Not playing this as regularly as I used to, but there still seem to be sooo many secrets left to uncover.
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33**: I am probably around 10h into this one. It is very very good and I say that despite the unsurprising difficulty I have with the parry timing.
- Others: My weekend online "boardgame" gaming group has started a new game: [Sunderfolk on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2414270/Sunderfolk/). The neat thing is only one of us needed to buy the game, the rest of us are participating via screenshare + mobile app.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 64,970 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Still haven't gotten back to 70k, though this is at least a better total than the last 3 weeks' worth of steps. The weather is still a bit hot, but thankfully we get the occasional afternoon rain showers lowering the temp a bit.

This, like so much else we’re confronted with today, is a lie."

On dark days, it’s easy to think that there’s no room for art, because the work of survival is so demanding. But art doesn’t merely take time—it gives time and energy back. It renews our spirits and the spirits of everyone who sees or hears or experiences the art, who receives the art as it’s intended: as a gift."

It's telling that the creators of so many of the AI tools don't even have enough confidence in their offerings to simply let users choose to adopt them, and are instead forcing them into users' faces in every possible corner of their apps and websites."

### Looking Forward

Elections in about 8 days!

Not sure about upcoming releases for May, I think there's something I'm looking forward to, but I haven't noted it anywhere. New Mission Impossible is out later this month, but IDK if I wanna catch that in the cinema.
