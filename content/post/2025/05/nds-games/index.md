Ninjatown was this kinda idiotic and cutesy little tower defense game about ninjas fighting demons; nothing too special but good enough to pass the time with. Basically like a mobile game! You deployed buildings that generated ninjas to fight the demons that would pass by. My favorite (and maybe only) memory of this is that there are some special powers that require weird actions unique to the DS; one of them was that you had a tornado that you can summon by blowing into the DS' mic. I remember playing this game while commuting on an FX van and my fellow passengers staring at the very odd large man blowing into his tiny video game device!

I am pretty sure I finished this game via SNES emulation/fan translation sometime in the early 2000s, so I am kind of surprised that I spent the hours to play through it again on NDS. I guess I enjoyed it enough! The DS release was the first time the game received an official English translation.

Dragon Quest V was kinda unique among the series in that it featured three generations of "heroes"; the party members in the screenshots above include Guy with epitaph "A Hero's Father", Parry "The Legandary Hero", and Madchen ("Daughter"). The daughter got the short end of the stick! Guy's father died early on in the story searching for the legendary hero who would turn out to be his own grandson! I think this was also the first Dragon Quest game with recruitable monsters - though in this save I seem to have recruited only normal/common monsters like a golem and a sabrecat tiger and a slime knight (TBF, I love slime knights!)

### Dragon Quest IX: Sentinel of the Starry Skies

Finished: UNFINISHED!

Playtime: 39:27

I played this game in 2010, and all this time I thought/misremembered that I had finished this game, but this save I loaded is proof otherwise! The "story so far" screenshot implies I stopped right before the very final boss for some reason. But the save loads back in Alltrades Abbey. Did I retreat to heal up before facing the final boss?!? I ended up going to the final dungeon and confirming that yep, the final boss is not yet defeated!

I have a vague recollection of the story of this where you're some kind of celestial being/"angel" trying to figure out what happened to the world. 
[HLTB](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2817) says Dragon Quest IX takes 47.5 hours to beat the main story, so I probably need like 8 more hours of grinding to get there! Completionist runs are rated at 742 hours so I'm glad I didn't attempt that!

I did enjoy this game, I think. I managed to scavenge some notes on the game from that time (2010):

- [Jul 11](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/143064785707651): Anyone else playing DQ9 on the NDS? Please explain the wifi stuff to me. (Later)) Apparently it only uses local adhoc wifi, I was hoping it would use the internet wifi.
- Jul 21: DQ9 is pretty fun, with all the need for switching jobs and reseting levels to easily get skill points.
- Jul 25: Wow I got captured! I feel like I always get captured in DQ games. Funny though, after being captured I was still carrying all my equipment
- Jul 31: Dragon Quest IX is also going fine. When my glasses broke I played a couple of hours of it since I could play it without eyeglasses and not be stupid. There are still a lot of places on the map I couldn't reach - don't I get any flying thingy? It would be silly if I only got one in the post game.
- Aug 01: I realized I have also more or less not used any FAQs for Dragon Quest IX. There was a single instance where I needed to know what was the best place to hunt for Metal Slimes, but that's it. So I'm pretty much conquering this game myself (although as mentioned, I don't really understand the treasure map mechanic...maybe I should read a manual?)
- Aug 20: Dragon Quest IX - I should finish this game. It's an open loop.
- Aug 25: The save file I loaded from the R4 has this date, so presumably that was the last time I played the game and I never bothered picking it back up again!
