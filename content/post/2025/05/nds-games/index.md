### Intro

Previously: [3DS Games Part 1](/2023/06/3ds-games/), [3DS Games Part 2](/2023/06/3ds-games-2/), [NDS tag for blog posts](/blog/tags/nds/)

A couple of years ago, I wrote some retro reviews of games I finished from my 3DS library. Today I'm going to talk about the predecessor system and its games: The Nintendo DS! 

I first got a Nintendo DS around October of 2006 and around July 2008, the hinge broke!

On <time>[7/9/2010, 10:49:23 AM]</time> [I wrote](https://roytang.net/files/twitter/roytang/status/18084851998/):

> Terrific. I just broke the hinge off my DS, now the upper screen is tilted. When is the 3DS coming out?

I still managed to keep playing with the system for another month or so until August 2008, when I appear to have abandoned it completely, presumably because it became unusable. I am kind of surprised the system only lasted me less than 2 years, considering my two 3DS systems have lasted for more than a decade now and still working fine (except for some stick issues I guess).

I dug the NDS out of storage a couple months ago and it was in terrible shape, you can easily see why I stopped using it:

That being said, this thing still boots and the upper display still works somehow through the tiny cable barely holding both halves together! The NDS still had the R4 cart I was using to play ROMs (yes yes, it is piracy!) and more importantly for the purposes of this post: I was able to recover a bunch of save files from the SD card! Now I can use this as an excuse to write about these old-timey games I enjoyed back in the day! (Note: I did manage to write some blog post reviews of games like the Ace Attorney games and Advance Wars games back in the day, you can hit them up via the NDS tag link above.)

To help with this task I set about looking for an NDS emulator and settled on DS on [DeSmuME](https://www.desmume.com/) (a little troublesome to spell with the random capitalization); I needed the emulator to load the save files and also to take screenshots.

### New Super Mario Bros

Finished: 2006-12-08

Playtime: ???

{{< photos Mario >}}

I [started playing New Super Mario Bros in 2006, even before I got an NDS](/2006/08/nintendo-ds-2/), via an officmate who brought his to work. At that point the last Mario game I had played had been Super Mario World released back in 1991, so it had been a while! New Super Mario Bros was the start of a new wave of NSMB games that was a new design for the series but honestly it all still felt very familiar despite the new power-ups and everything, like catching up again with an old friend.

A highlight for us in the office was the availability of local multiplayer minigames which we enjoyed for a good while. These weren't super complicated, but were good fun. 

It looks like I started playing my own save around October 2006 when I first got my own NDS finished it in early December. The 2 out of 3 stars on my save indicates the completion level. The first star means I beat the game, and I think the second one is for unlocking all hidden paths. The 3rd star can be earned by spending all the star coins which I guess I never did for some reason.

### Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow

Finished: 2006-12-12

Playtime: ???

I was not able to recover a save file for this game, but including it here because I know from other notes the date that I finished it. The only other thing my notes tell me about this game is that I had trouble with the grim reaper fight but found the final boss easy, using Abaddon + a big sword to manage his minions.

See further notes on the NDS Castlevania games below.

### Castlevania: Order of Ecclesia

Finished: 2010-07-03 (estimated based on save file metadata)

Playtime: 10:26

{{< photos Eclessia >}}

*Order of Ecclesia* is the 3rd Castlevania game on the NDS (the first two being *Dawn of Sorrow* and *Portrait of Ruin*), and I was pretty sad that it was the only one of the three which had a save file I could recover. Honestly all 3 games kind of blur together for me; I couldn't describe their individual plots right now. That being said I did enjoy these games and I am pretty sure this trilogy cemented my so-far-lifelong enjoyment of metroidvania games despite never having played Symphony of the Night. I also remember being amazed at how well I could still tackle the challenging bosses!

The loaded save file tells me I finished Ecclesia in around 10.5 hours, which is coincidentally [the HLTB average for a "Main Story" run for this game](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/1589). Also I tried to fight the final boss with the default emulator keyboard controls and it was terrible lol. This kind of game really needs a controller and I have yet to get my controller working with the emulator.

All 3 of the games are playable on Steam via [the Castlevania Dominus Collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2369900/Castlevania_Dominus_Collection/)! These are among the few NDS/3DS games that escaped the confines of Nintendo handhelds and made it to more conventional platforms. Maybe someday I will get around to replaying them even!

### Ninjatown

Finished: [2009-07-10](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/97407337198)

Playtime: ???

{{< photos Ninjatown >}}

Ninjatown was this kinda idiotic and cutesy little tower defense game about ninjas fighting demons; nothing too special but good enough to pass the time with. Basically like a mobile game! You deployed buildings that generated ninjas to fight the demons that would pass by. My favorite (and maybe only) memory of this is that there are some special powers that require weird actions unique to the DS; one of them was that you had a tornado that you can summon by blowing into the DS' mic. I remember playing this game while commuting on an FX van and my fellow passengers staring at the very odd large man blowing into his tiny video game device!

### Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride

Finished: [2009-07-11](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/101183979130)

Playtime: 23:39

{{< photos dq5 >}}

I am pretty sure I finished this game via SNES emulation/fan translation sometime in the early 2000s, so I am kind of surprised that I spent the hours to play through it again on NDS. I guess I enjoyed it enough! The DS release was the first time the game received an official English translation.

Dragon Quest V was kinda unique among the series in that it featured three generations of "heroes"; the party members in the screenshots above include Guy with epitaph "A Hero's Father", Parry "The Legandary Hero", and Madchen ("Daughter"). The daughter got the short end of the stick! Guy's father died early on in the story searching for the legendary hero who would turn out to be his own grandson! I think this was also the first Dragon Quest game with recruitable monsters - though in this save I seem to have recruited only normal/common monsters like a golem and a sabrecat tiger and a slime knight (TBF, I love slime knights!)

### Professor Layton and the Curious Village

Finished: [2009-08-28](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/119317562911)

Playtime: 06:35

{{< photos Layton >}}

HLTB says [this game typically takes 14 hours for a completionist run](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/7337); my save is at 6hrs and 35 mins and has all puzzles solved! (This despite my FB post linked above saying I did **not** finish all the puzzles at the time.) I kind of suspect some shenanigans here; either that or I was just very good at solving the game's puzzles lol.

I did enjoy this game, though I never did get around to playing any of the sequels. The puzzles were pretty fun and as I recall some of them were quite taxing on the brain. I seem to recall liberally using the hint coins as needed though.

### Outro

Not a lot of games to list here unfortunately, though I will do a follow-up post to this at some point. There were some save files I was unable to get to work, so I have to figure those out first. And there were save files also for some games which I never finished but would be interesting to write about. (Including one particularly annoying example that all this time I believed I had finished! I have so many words for that one!)

And there are also a good number NDS games that I know I have finished yet have never written a review for and don't have any save files for. Off the top of my head: I really enjoyed *Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime* and *Final Fantasy Tactics A2*, Wondering if it's a good idea to also write about these games with whatever I can remember and also maybe see if I can find anything in my old notes.
