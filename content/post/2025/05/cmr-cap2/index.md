### Previously

This is the part 18 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). 

The volume numbering for Captain America can be particularly confusing. As always, my preferred reference is [the list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(B%E2%80%93C)#C).

### Post Heroes Reborn

#### Captain America v4 (1998)

50 issues

A bit less than half of this run was written by Mark Waid. The rest was honestly kind of unremarkable; the most memorable thing for me was this skrull that tried to pretend to be Captain America to rile people up, felt like early shades of both Secret Invasion and Secret Empire.

#### Captain America v5 (2001)

32 issues

They decided to reboot the series after 9-11 (unsurprising) under the Marvel Knights. The first 3 arcs were written by John Ney Rieber. [His wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ney_Rieber) states that he left the book before all 3 arcs were published due to "creative differences" and they had to hire Chuck Austen to finish his partials. It kinda shows; the most annoying part is the "Ice" story arc which attempts to rewrite the origin story of how Cap got into the ice. Apparently it was originally supposed to be a standalone out-of-continuity series but got merged into the main book. The changes to the origin described here are never referenced again anywhere else! The rest of the volume is unremarkable; some good artists and writers in there though, mostly only for a story arc. The volume ends with "Captain America: Disassembled" story arc, to tie-in with the "Avengers: Disassembled" story happening at the same time.

### The Brubaker Era

Brubaker's run is largely considered the best Captain America run of the modern era. It features a lot of spy intrigue, sci-fi shenanigans, Red Skull plotting, all executed well, all of this during a time when the status quo of the Marvel universe was constantly upended - Brubaker's run covers the Civil War, Secret Invasion (though the run does not tie in to that) and Norman Osborn's Dark Reign.

#### Captain America v6 (2005)

71 issues: #1-50, #600-619, #615.1

Brubaker is of course most famous for bringing back a character that had previously been considered one of those classic characters such as Peter Parker's Uncle Ben or Bruce Wayne's parents that were considered as "dead means dead", i.e. no one would ever bring back. Bucky Barnes tragic sacrifice during World War II was considered foundational to Steve Rogers' history and his guilt, but his return as the Winter Soldier and the additional back story was executed so well everyone just accepted it.

{{< photos 1584 >}}

I started a Reddit discussion about it back in 2014 when I first read the first few story arcs of Brubaker's run: 

> **Posted on r/comicbooks: [Question about Brubaker's Winter Soldier story line](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/22jfmb/question_about_brubakers_winter_soldier_story_line/)**
> 
> Just finished reading the Man Out of Time and Winter Soldier story arcs of Brubaker's Captain America run.
> 
> I wasn't really keeping up with comics back then, how did fans react to Brubaker bringing back Bucky? Did people know ahead of time he was coming back, was it hinted at, or was it a big surprise?
> 

After bringing back Bucky Barnes as the Winter Soldier, the second most audacious thing in this run is that they actually killed off Steve Rogers after the Civil War tie-ins at issue #25 (2007). After some hesitation, Bucky reluctantly agrees to take up the mantle of Captain America and would serve in that capacity for the remainder of the run. Steve Rogers would remain dead for the majority of the volume until he was brought back in 2009's Captain America Reborn (see below). Even then, he lets Bucky carry on as Captain America for a while. The volume ends with Bucky being forced to give up the mantle when he is called to account for his crimes as the Winter Soldier and actually extradited to Russia for a while.

{{< photos 1585 >}}

#### Captain America Reborn (2009)

6 issues

This miniseries (also by Brubaker) centers around Sharon Carter and friends' effort to bring back Steve Rogers, whose consciousness had been displaced across space and time following his death. Basically a lot of sci-fi and time travel shenanigans, including Steve secretly embedding some hidden instructions in Vision's memory in the past, to help the gang bring him back in the present.

#### Captain America: Who Will Wield the Shield

One-shot

This was a one-shot by Brubaker centered around what happens to the Captain America mantle after Steve Rogers returns while Bucky is still serving as Captain America.

#### Captain America: Who Won't Wield the Shield

One-shot

This was a parody/comedy one-shot NOT by Brubaker about various Captain America parody characters. It's probably not in continuity, but I read it so I added it here lol.

#### Captain America and ... (2011)

22 issues: 

- Captain America and Bucky #620-628
- Captain America and Hawkeye #629-632
- Captain America and Iron Man #633-635
- Captain America and Namor #635.1
- Captain America and Black Widow #636-640

It infuriates me to no end that this set of team-up books continues the numbering from v6, yet v7 is the one to follow the legacy numbering. I think Brubaker was involved in the first few arcs (the Bucky ones?) Starting from "... and Hawkeye", Cullen Bunn took over writing duties and there is an overarching storyline about a multiversal villain named Kashmir Vennema who formed a corporation with her multiversal variants.

#### Captain America v7 (2011)

19 issues.

As mentioned above, the legacy numbering continues with this reboot volume, still by Brubaker and with Steve serving as Captain America once again. This volume is still okay, though the previous one is much better. I do like that Brubaker brought back Diamondback (Rachel Leighton), who is one of my favorite Captain America supporting characters (too bad she was cut out of [Brave New World](/2025/04/movies-tv-1q/#captain-america-brave-new-world-2025)!)

### The Spencer Era

Alright, now we skip ahead a couple of years to Nick Spencer's era. The intervening years were covered by [my review of Rick Remender's run](/2023/01/marvel-run-3-captain-america-etc/#captain-america-v8-2013-2014) in a previous post. That volume ends with Captain America being re-aged and losing his Super Soldier Serum powers and deciding to turn the mantle of Captain America over to Sam Wilson.

Overall, Spencer's era was okay, though not as good as Brubaker's I think. The highlight of this era was the introduction of an evil, Hydra-aligned version of Captain America/Steve Rogers in Secret Empire.

#### Captain America: Sam Wilson (2015)

24 issues

{{< photos 1586 >}}

This is Sam's first volume as Captain America! And to say he faces a lot of challenges as a black man taking over the role is an understatement - a good part of the volume has the Red Skull (of course he is back!) stirring up public sentiment against Sam in the new role. A lot of racism and immigration issues are involved of course. This volume has the first appearance of Joaquin Torres as the Falcon, who is the victim of genetic manipulation by Karl Malus. Things come to a head after Steve Rogers is repowered (see Avengers Standoff below), and there is a public outcry that Sam "give back the shield". The volume ends with tie-ins to the Secret Empire event (see below).

#### Avengers Standoff (2016)

Three one-shots that aren't part of other series:

- Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill #1
- Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1
- Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega #1

This crossover centered around Pleasant Hill, seemingly a small idyllic town in rural America, but in reality a prison for super criminals run by SHIELD. Maria Hill has used a living cosmic cube named Kobik to trap the supervillains in mundane lifestyles with no memory of their past selves. All hell breaks loose when Helmut Zemo and some other prisoners manage to regain their memory and take the town hostage. This is a relatively small crossover event that ties-in to the Avengers and Captain America: Sam Wilson books.

The most important consequence in this crossover is that Kobik restores Steve Rogers to his prime age, but also secretly rewrites his history because she was manipulated by the Red Skull (see below).

#### Captain America: Steve Rogers (2016)

19 issues

{{< photos 1587 >}}

The first issue of this new volume ends with the shocking reveal that Steve Rogers is Hydra! Serving once again as Captain America in parallel to Steve Rogers (albeit using a different non-round shield), this Steve Rogers is revealed to have been raised as a Hydra agent from a young age and sent in to become Captain America as a sleeper agent. In his "timeline" (created by Kobik), the Nazis and Hydra were about to win the war when the allies rewrote reality with a cosmic cube, allegedly resulting in the 616. Now convinced he has to bring back that "superior" Hydra reality, he first works to overthrow his handler The Red Skull, before setting into motion the events of Secret Empire.

#### Captain America v9 (2017)

1 issue. Officially this is Captain America #25, continuing the numbering from Sam's series above.

#### Secret Empire (2017)

Main title: 10 issues
Side titles:

- Secret Empire: Brave New World #1–5
- Secret Empire: Underground #1
- Secret Empire: United #1
- Secret Empire: Uprising #1
- Secret Empire Omega

I did read the main title for this event back in the day, probably not the side titles though. I did remember enjoying it, but I feel like I appreciate it all the more right now having read the build-up in the 2 Captain America series prior to the event. The entire plan of stranding the heavy hitters outside the planetary shield and the street-level heroes in New York under a darkforce dome while Hydra Cap takes over everywhere else was pretty good. If you wanna read the side stories, I guess Brave New World is the most important one.

At the end of the event, the original Steve Rogers is brought back from Kobik's memories and he takes down Hydra Cap in a televised battle, but his reputation remains tarnished. Hydra Cap sticks around in the 616 to wreak havoc again later!

### Post Secret Empire

#### Captain America v10 (2017)

10 issues: #695-704

This short run by Mark Waid consisted of 3 short story arcs. The run was okay, starting off with Cap facing off against white supremacists, then time travel shenanigans. My favorite is the last story arc which follows the adventures of one of Steve Rogers' descendants who faces a corrupt government and the return of the Red Skull (same old same old!)

#### Captain America v11 (2018)

+5 issues.

Already covered in [the previous post](/2023/01/marvel-run-3-captain-america-etc/#captain-america-v11-2018-2021), BUT I found out the issue count there is wrong. The run is 30 issues instead of 25 mentioned in the previous post. So I am adding +5 issues here just to correct my count.

#### Captain America v12 (2022)

1 issue: #0

This was a one-shot where Steve and Sam team-up to stop one of Armin Zola's mad schemes. At the end of it, they agree that they can both be Captain America. (I am not sure where the second shield comes from!). This issue kicks off two parallel series, one each for Sam and Steve.

#### Captain America: Symbol of Truth (2022)

14 issues

Symbol of Truth is written by Tochi Onyebuch and focuses on Sam as Captain America. His primary antagonist is The White Wolf, adopted brother of Black Panther. Supporting characters include Misty Knight, Joaquin Torres, and Ian Rogers (Nomad).

This series and Sentinel of Liberty below conclude with the Cold War crossover in issues #12 and #13, but Sam gets an extra #14 issue to wrap things up.

Presumably Sam is the "primary" Captain America, so this series gets the legacy numbering instead of the other one. #14 is LGY#749

#### Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty v2 (2022)

13 issues

This is the second Sentinel of Liberty volume; the first one was post-Heroes Reborn by Mark Waid and I will cover that some other time (too many titles in this post already!) This one is written by Collin Kelly and Jackson Lanzing.

In this volume, Steve and supporting characters Sharon Carter and Bucky Barnes investigate a shadowy cabal called The Outer Circle that have been manipulating world events throughout history. Heading into the Cold War crossover, Bucky has taken on the mantle of The Revolution, one of the Outer Circle's agents, and plans to dismantle them from the inside.

#### One-Shots

- Captain America Cold War Alpha
- Captain America Cold War omega
- Captain America Finale

The Cold War crossover sees Steve and Sam team-up to fight the apparent collaboration between White Wolf and Bucky Barnes as The Revolution. Bucky installs White Wolf as ruler of Dimension Z and kidnaps Ian Rogers to bring him there, luring the Captains America to a final showdown. In the end, it was revealed that Bucky had an overly complicated plot to defeat the Outer Circle and install Ian as the ruler of Dimension Z, relying on Steve and Sam to defeat White Wolf's army. At the end of it, Sharon takes on the mantle of The Destroyer in memory of their former ally Roger Aubrey.

*Finale* wraps up the Outer Circle loose ends and concludes the Century Game (kind of serving as an epilogue to *Sentinel of Liberty*, Kelly and Lanzing's equivalent to *Symbol of Truth's* #14)

#### Captain America v13 (2023)

1 issue: #750

This a one-shot anthology issue wrapping up the 2 parallel Captain America series and the Cold War event. (Takes place before Captain America Finale)

#### Captain America v14 (2023)

16 issues

A short volume by Straczynski focused on Steve Rogers, mostly dealing with supernatural stuff. Honestly kind of forgettable. Ends with a team-up with Spider-Man and Thor to restore the city of Broxton. Ends with LGY#766

### Wrapping Up

Whew, what a long post. Writing these is always exhausting! Captain America faces much more supernatural/cosmic cube shenanigans than I would have expected before reading all his books!

With that, we are caught up with the main Captain America books! By "main", I mean this should cover all the series that are included as part of Captain America's legacy numbering, and their associated side series and events. Beyond this point there is a new Sam Wilson ongoing (he still gets to continue the legacy numbering) and a new Steve Rogers series launching later this year. There are of course numerous standalone limited series and one shots starring Captain America that I have yet to cover and will need to figure out someday, but for now we can leave Cap alone for a while!

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 335. 

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 26 (!)

Total issues covered so far: 5,550 + 335 = 5,885

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 35,671 (+166 since the previous post)

Progress: 16.5% (15.63% last post). A decent jump.

### Up Next

Not sure yet what I am covering next, I am currently still catching up with ongoing series. Some options: 

- If we follow MCU movie order, we can continue reading Thor next; I've already covered a good chunk of modern era Thor in [the Jason Aaron post](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/) so there's a good chance we can cover most of the main Thor books in the next post. The high fantasy of Asgard would also be a good contrast/palette cleanser after the more grounded Cap stuff.
- I'm also kind of tempted to do a Punisher read, since he's the Marvel Netflix TV guy I haven't covered yet. He's another "grounded" hero, but kind of opposite to Cap ideologically.
- Something else?!?
