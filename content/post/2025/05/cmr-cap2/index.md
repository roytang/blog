### Previously

This is the part 18 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). 

The volume numbering for Captain America can be particularly confusing. As always, my preferred reference is [the list on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(B%E2%80%93C)#C).

### Post Heroes Reborn

#### Captain America v4 (1998)

50 issues

#### Captain America v5 (2001)

32 issues

### The Brubaker Era

#### Captain America v6 (2005)

71 issues: #1-50, #600-619, #615.1

#### Captain America Reborn (2009)

6 issues

#### Captain America: Who Will Wear the Shield

One-shot

#### Captain America: Who Won't Wear the Shield

One-shot

#### Captain America and ... (2011)

22 issues: 

- Captain America and Bucky #620-628
- Captain America and Hawkeye #629-632
- Captain America and Iron Man #633-635
- Captain America and Namor #635.1
- Captain America and Black Widow #636-640

It infuriates me to no end that this set of team-up books continues the numbering from v6, yet v7 is the one to follow the legacy numbering.

#### Captain America v7 (2011)

### The Spencer Era

#### Captain America: Sam Wilson

24 issues

#### Avengers Standoff

Three one-shots that aren't part of other series:

- Avengers Standoff: Welcome to Pleasant Hill #1
- Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha #1
- Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Omega #1

#### Captain America: Steve Rogers

19 issues

#### Captain America v9 (2017)

1 issue. Officially this is Captain America #25, continuing the numbering from Sam's series above.

#### Secret Empire

Main title: 10 issues
Side titles:

- Secret Empire: Brave New World #1â€“5
- Secret Empire: Underground #1
- Secret Empire: United #1
- Secret Empire: Uprising #1
- Secret Empire Omega

### Post Secret Empire

#### Captain America v10 (2017)

10 issues: #695-704

#### Captain America v11 (2018)

+5 issues.

Already covered in [the previous post](/2023/01/marvel-run-3-captain-america-etc/#captain-america-v11-2018-2021), BUT I found out the issue count there is wrong. The run is 30 issues instead of 25 mentioned in the previous post. So I am adding +5 issues here just to correct my count.

#### Captain America v12 (2022)

1 issue: #0

#### Captain America: Symbol of Truth (2022)

14 issues

#### Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty v2 (2022)

13 issues

#### One-Shots

- Captain America Cold War Alpha
- Captain America Cold War omega
- Captain America Finale

#### Captain America v13 (2023)

1 issue: #750

#### Captain America v14 (2023)

16 issues

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 343.

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 26 (!)

Total issues covered so far: 5,550 + 343 = 5,893

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 35,611 (+106 since the previous post)

Progress: 16.55% (15.63% last post). A decent jump.

### CMR Notes

Some notes about my progress on the complete Marvel run:

- So far I have been strictly reading and reviewing comics by title/volume, but that might not work in the case of characters like Spider-Man who for a couple of decades had multiple ongoing titles that regularly crossed over with each other. I am considering shifting to a year-by-year approach for this sort of group of titles. After all, I don't want to cover Maximum Carnage or the 90s Clone Saga again when I go through *Amazing Spider-Man*, then again when I cover *Web of Spider-Man* etc. I need to think about how I am going to index those reviews though, since my current system is still by title.
- Correspondingly, I am considering the "year by year" approach to annuals as well - mostly because Marvel has this habit of having some crossover stories happen across the set of annuals for a year. And it would free me from having to include the annuals when I cover each title. There are much less annuals published than regular titles, so this one is very feasible.
- I'm still not satisfied with the rate at which my completion rate is increasing. At this rate it will take something like 20 more years before I finish the complete marvel run! That isn't really a problem, since I mostly still enjoy reading the comics, but I would still like to hit a faster rate. The main issue is that there are at least an estimated 3000 to 5000 issues that I have already read prior to the 2020s but don't have write-ups for. To at least stop the backlog of newer from growing too quickly, I'm going to try to include more of the newer/current volumes in these posts (which is why I included ASM v7 above). And maybe try to up the frequency of these posts? Not sure if that's feasible - at this point the limiting factor is how fast I can make the write-ups!

### Up Next

Okay, for real, the next entry should be focused on **Captain America** post-Heroes Reborn.

Soooo many words in this entry. I really doubt anyone else is reading these CMR posts, it is the epitome of "posts that I write for myself" lol.

[^1]: I understand I am going to have read more Venom/Carnage/symbiote stuff eventually as I progress through this run and oh boy that may or may not be fun lol.
