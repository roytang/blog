Last weekend of March!

Local elections' campaign period started this week. While I was out walking near the church, there was a lady handing out fliers for a councilor candidate. Another lady who seemed to know her passed by and got a flier and said (probably jokingly) *"Wala bang pera 'to?"* ("Isn't there any money here?"). The one giving out fliers said *"Alam mo naman bawal yan!"* ("You know that's not allowed!") and they laughed heartily together. 

### My Week

Spent most of the day Tuesday mired in hospital paperwork for Patient#1, in prep for some upcoming routine tests.

Went to get some lab tests done, but found out belatedly that my doctor isn't available this weekend for my very much delayed regularly-scheduled checkup, so it will be delayed even further. 

Cleaning up, decluttering, tossing stuff out, cooking a bit, making my scrambled eggs fluffier, eating mangoes. Was generally a more chill week than the previous one.

On the blog this week: [A new Complete Marvel Run post about Spider-Man](/2025/03/cmr-spider-man/)!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Comics: Finished a bunch of Spider-Man stuff, started some Captain America stuff, still reading new comics.
- Books: Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly; I'm not really having trouble with it, I've just been prioritizing comics, but I might try to power through it soon because there are some other books I want to read.

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Abbott Elementary**, **Daredevil: Born Again**. 
- Not yet started: **Wheel of Time S3**
- Finished: **Elementary**! All 7 seasons! Also **Sakamoto Days** S1 part 1 (apparently there is a part 2 later this year).
- Watched a bunch of movies this weekend: [Kraven the Hunter (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/kraven-the-hunter/), [A Real Pain (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/a-real-pain/), [Dragon Ball Super: Super Hero (2022)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/dragon-ball-super-super-hero/), [Spy (2015)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/spy/)

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Avowed**, maybe 2/3 through area #4 at the moment, I guess my rate has slowed down a bit.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Google Fit tells me I walked 70,290 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Second 70k week in a row! The weather is starting to get hotter, though there are still the occasional rain showers on some days.

I have been considering whether it makes sense to continue including these recent links in the weeknotes. It's a bit of redundancy since they are already in the linkblog, but I like having a weekly summary of sorts? It also helps fill out the weeknotes, though that's not really important is it? I'll let that thought percolate a bit longer.

### Looking Forward

Andor season 2 sometime in April! Not much else on the release calendar. 

Well, there's Clair Obscur 33 which is coming this month on PC Game Pass (I think), but I'm not sure yet if I want to get into that.

The usual end of month stuff this coming week: errands, etc. Will see if I can see my doctor as well.

Holy Week is from the 13th (Palm Sunday) to the 20th (Easter Sunday).
