Yesterday was [World Poetry Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Poetry_Day). Here are some poems I've shared through the years:

#### Wild Geese by Mary Oliver 

*(via [CBCBird](https://twitter.com/CBCbird/statuses/1108873864619028480/))*

> You do not have to be good.
> 
> You do not have to walk on your knees
> 
> for a hundred miles through the desert repenting.
> 
> You only have to let the soft animal of your body
> 
> love what it loves.
> 
> Tell me about despair, yours, and I will tell you mine.
> 
> Meanwhile the world goes on.
> 
> Meanwhile the sun and the clear pebbles of the rain
> 
> are moving across the landscapes,
> 
> over the prairies and the deep trees,
> 
> the mountains and the rivers.
> 
> Meanwhile the wild geese, high in the clean blue air,
> 
> are heading home again.
> 
> Whoever you are, no matter how lonely,
> 
> the world offers itself to your imagination,
> 
> calls to you like the wild geese, harsh and exciting -
> 
> over and over announcing your place
> 
> in the family of things.

#### [Small Kindnesses by Danusha Lameris](https://www.danushalameris.com/poems)

> I’ve been thinking about the way, when you walk
> 
> down a crowded aisle, people pull in their legs
> 
> to let you by. Or how strangers still say “bless you”
> 
> when someone sneezes, a leftover
> 
> from the Bubonic plague. “Don’t die,” we are saying.
> 
> And sometimes, when you spill lemons
> 
> from your grocery bag, someone else will help you
> 
> pick them up. Mostly, we don’t want to harm each other.
> 
> We want to be handed our cup of coffee hot,
> 
> and to say thank you to the person handing it. To smile
> 
> at them and for them to smile back. For the waitress
> 
> to call us honey when she sets down the bowl of clam chowder,
> 
> and for the driver in the red pick-up truck to let us pass.
> 
> We have so little of each other, now. So far
> 
> from tribe and fire. Only these brief moments of exchange.
> 
> What if they are the true dwelling of the holy, these
> 
> fleeting temples we make together when we say, “Here,
> 
> have my seat,” “Go ahead—you first,” “I like your hat.”
>

### The World Is A Beautiful Place by Lawrence Ferlinghetti

<blockquote><pre>
        The world is a beautiful place 
                                to be born into 
if you don’t mind happiness 
                        not always being 
                                        so very much fun 
       if you don’t mind a touch of hell
                                   now and then
                just when everything is fine
                                         because even in heaven
                                they don’t sing 
                                            all the time

             The world is a beautiful place
                                   to be born into
       if you don’t mind some people dying
                                      all the time
                        or maybe only starving
                                   some of the time
                 which isn’t half so bad
                                  if it isn’t you

        The world is a beautiful place 
                                to be born into 
               if you don’t much mind
                                 a few dead minds
                    in the higher places
                                or a bomb or two
                        now and then
                              in your upturned faces
         or such other improprieties
                            as our Name Brand society
                        is prey to
                              with its men of distinction
             and its men of extinction
                                   and its priests
                         and other patrolmen
                                         and its various segregations
         and congressional investigations
                                         and other constipations
                    that our fool flesh
                                    is heir to

Yes the world is the best place of all
                                   for a lot of such things as
    making the fun scene
                        and making the love scene
and making the sad scene
                     and singing low songs of having 
                                                  inspirations
and walking around 
                looking at everything
                                 and smelling flowers
and goosing statues
                  and even thinking 
                                 and kissing people and
     making babies and wearing pants
                                 and waving hats and
                     dancing
                        and going swimming in rivers
                  on picnics
                       in the middle of the summer
and just generally
                ‘living it up’

Yes
   but then right in the middle of it
                                comes the smiling
                                             mortician
