I glanced at the wall calendar earlier today and was aghast to find that the month is more than halfway done. Time flies.

### The World

Big news this week here in the PH: as he arrived from Hong Kong last Wednesday, former president Duterte was arrested on the strength of an ICC warrant and later that same day was flown via chartered jet to The Hague to stand trial on charges of crimes against humanity. Outrage from the supporters/fanatics as expected, including recriminations against their former allies the Marcoses. I am sure there was a lot of amused popcorn munching among the many different group chats; one of my friends said she bought a cake to celebrate. This is just the start of a long process, but given that the ICC already has custody and how long the process can take, there is a good chance that the 80-year-old former president Duterte will not be returning the PH in his lifetime.

### My Week

Two of my weekdays were spent accompanying Patient#1 for some tests. The tests were routine, but there was still a bunch of waiting and paperwork to be done so that I basically spent all day at the hospital for those days. These are just regular monitoring tests, not like the periodic immunotherapy of 2024, so we are hoping everything comes back good and we don't have to worry about anything for the next few months at least. 

Lots of IRL decluttering and cleanup this week. I am tossing out a lot of stuff, old papers etc. I am scanning anything that seems relevant. My inventory of MTG cards is close to the end, though there are some valuable cards that I can't find at the moment.

On the blog this week: Nothing except the last weeknotes. I did start some drafts already, but nothing finished yet. Blog more!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Still mostly just comics recently, lots of Spider-Man stuff, but also trying to catch up on everything else. The next [Complete Marvel Run](/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post is already drafted, just waiting for the current ASM volume to finish so I can include it. Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Sakamoto Days**, **Abbott Elementary**, **Daredevil: Born Again**. 
- Finished: **Dragon Ball Daima**, **Invincible S3**
- Not yet started: **Wheel of Time S3**
- Binging: **Elementary** via Prime Video. Currently on season 4!
- Haven't watched any new movies in a while! I hope to get around to some this week.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Avowed**, currently wandering around area #3.
- A friend gifted me **Rainbox Six Siege** from the Steam Sales so that I can join their coop games! I have yet to do the tutorial.

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 60,133 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). Still a good leap from 70k, but a big improvement from last week.
