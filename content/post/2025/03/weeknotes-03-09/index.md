### My Week

Last Wednesday was Ash Wednesday, so we are officially in Lent.

We have a household rule where we NEVER leave the house unattended. When we had a stay-in helper this was trivial as she was there to stand watch 99% of the time, but now that it's just me and the folks, we have to be more careful with scheduling our excursions to make sure someone always stays at home. This creates some complications. For example: I missed this week's quiz night because the parents had a thing on the same night. And when they are out it means I can't go out for my walks.

*(Trivia team still attended and finished third though.)*

I am not sure we can ever get a full-time stay-in helper again; it is hard to find someone you can trust and all. However, we have managed to find someone to help part-time with the cleaning and gardening and laundry and other stuff. She will come in to help a couple of times a week, so that should free up some of my time. This does not solve our "never leave the house unattended" problem.

I am starting to get through a lot of my pending decluttering tasks (both digital and physical), though there remains a lot to do. I am not sure if this is just a task that will never end.

My [paper shredder](/2019/04/shredder/) seems to no longer be working though. Not sure if I want to bother with a new one, since I no longer have a lot of paper mail coming in these days.

All of my Game Pass extra charges have been refunded!

On the blog this week: Nothing except the last weeknotes. I want to be blogging more, and I have a bunch of reviews I want to write, but just haven't found either the time or energy yet.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Still mostly just comics recently, lots of Spider-Man stuff, but also trying to catch up on everything else. I am very close to writing a new Complete Marvel Run post, though I want to finish reading the current ongoing ASM volume first. **Wind and Truth** still moving along very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Dragon Ball Daima**, **Sakamoto Days**, **Invincible S3**, **Abbott Elementary**. 
- Started watching: **Daredevil: Born Again**. I liked the first 2 episodes, though I am surprised with what they did in episode 1!!
- Binging: **Elementary** via Prime Video. Currently on season 3!

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then.
    - I tried to cram more Aetherdrift Quick Drafts in Arena before they rotated out, but that just tanked my win rate!
    - Sanctum mode in Marvel Snap is kinda meh and a terrible grind to complete, but it's nice that it lets me get Guardians Boosters.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Avowed**. I am almost done with the second area, so I think I am progressing at around a week per area and I think there are 5 areas, which seems like a decent rate.

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 48,049 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), the worst week since the start of Feb, I think. I only hit the 10k step count on 3 of the days. The rest of the week either I could not go out because of the weather or other reasons (see above). Will see if we can do better this coming week.

    Same. A lot of times I still feel like that dumb young adult from 2 decades ago.

    > It’s difficult to explain how much it matters that we’ve seen this movie before. (Well, technically, we’ve seen the beta version — what’s happening now is way more troubling.) When you’ve spent years watching how some tech bros break the rules in pursuit of personal and economic power at the expense of safety and user protections, all while wrapping themselves in the flag of “innovation,” you get pretty good at spotting the pattern.

    > This is why tech journalism’s perspective is so crucial right now. We’ve spent decades documenting how technology and entrepreneurship can either strengthen or undermine democratic institutions. We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once championed innovation and openness now actively work to consolidate control and dismantle the very systems that enabled their success.
