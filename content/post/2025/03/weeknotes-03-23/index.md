### My Week

Patient#1 got some good test results this week. We still have some routine paperwork and tests to get done, but the results mean we are in a good spot hopefully for most of the year.

The rest of my week was minor household errands, cleanup, decluttering, archiving, working on side projects, etc.

Trivia team skipped a scheduled quiz night last Thursday because of a lack of quorum.

On the blog this week: [Shared some poems for World Poetry Day](/2025/03/world-poetry-day/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Same update as last week: Still mostly just comics recently, lots of Spider-Man stuff, but also trying to catch up on everything else. Should be ready with the next [Complete Marvel Run](/tags/complete-marvel-run/) this coming week. Sanderson's **Wind and Truth** still moving along very very slowly. 

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Sakamoto Days**, **Abbott Elementary**, **Daredevil: Born Again**. 
- Not yet started: **Wheel of Time S3**
- Binging: **Elementary** via Prime Video. I am halfway through season 6, might manage to finish it before the end of month.
- Watched a couple of animated movies this week: [Galaxy Express 999 (1979)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/galaxy-express-999-the-movie/) and [Transformers One (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/transformers-one/).

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every now and then.
- Ongoing single-player games: **Avowed**, currently just started in area #4. I would guess I am 60% through the game?
- When my friend gifted me **Rainbox Six Siege**, it was based on the promise that I would join their co-op games, so I played a few games with them recently vs AI (promise fulfilled). As expected, I am pretty bad at this sort of game, but I said I'd join them again if need be. Also mildly annoyed at the anti-cheat stuff needing to be installed on my computer. Jeez!
- Took some damage from the Steam sale, mostly because apparently [we are getting an additional 12% tax on online purchases later this year](https://www.reddit.com/r/PHGamers/comments/1jd9qgd/psa_steam_will_start_taxing_ph_starting_june_1/).

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 70,083 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday). My first 70k week for the year! I am way behind compared to last year, but that's okay, we do the best we can.

### Links to Share

Not a lot this week:

- [I’m the Canadian who was detained by Ice for two weeks. It felt like I had been kidnapped  | US immigration | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/19/canadian-detained-us-immigration-jasmine-mooney)

    > The reality became clear: Ice detention isn’t just a bureaucratic nightmare. It’s a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.

    > Companies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It’s a lucrative business: CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.

    A harrowing account. I got a US tourist visa back in 2019, 10 years multiple entry, only used once. Given the current conditions in the US, I suspect I am not going to be using it again.

    > What this means, and what I have already seen on my own timelines, is that human-created content is getting almost entirely drowned out by AI-generated content because of the sheer amount of it.

    ...

    > My brute force attack metaphor isn’t perfect, because with a brute force attack, the ones being attacked try to stop what’s happening. In this case, the platforms are both paying spammers to brute force their platforms and increasingly have realized that they themselves can brute force their users with AI-generated ads that they can help companies make and optimize.

    ...

    Honestly just another reason to avoid the big social media platforms which promote this kind of slop

### Looking Forward

Last full week of March is coming up! Not much is scheduled for the coming week, though there are still some minor errands and such. 

The first two months of the year were very busy and stressful for me; by comparison March was relatively very chill. I've taken the time to regain my bearings, try to get the house back in order, establish a new status quo, catch up on lost time and so on. I'm hoping by April I can start moving on and actually get some good stuff done.
