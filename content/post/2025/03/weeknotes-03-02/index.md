A new month begins. We March forward I guess.

### The World

The USA continues to eat itself and openly align with Russia. The top US officials ambushed the leader of Ukraine with a shouting match during a live broadcast. It's weird watching the fall of an empire and the global realignment of geopolitics in real-time. I wonder if this is what it would have been like if we had the internet at the time the USSR fell?

RIP Michelle Trachtenberg (Dawn from Buffy) and Gene Hackman.

### My Week

Now that we no longer have a helper in the house (at least temporarily), I am forced to partake in many household chores I haven't practiced in a while: cleaning, cooking, doing the laundry, watering the plants, taking out the garbage, etc. I acknowledge that this is yet again another type of privilege I have had in my life that I often didn't have to think about all this domestic stuff that keeps a household running.

The trivia team [attended quiz night last Monday and we won](/2025/02/aboutquiz-love/)!

Other than that: the usual end-of-month errands. I managed to get started on some long overdue room cleanup as well, throwing out a bunch of papers and even preparing some bulk magic cards for disposal. There is still a lot to do, but honestly the most difficult part for me is just getting started with this sort of thing. Just need to build momentum!

This past weekend I mostly had to sit in the house all alone as the parents had places to go. This was fine, but also bad for my walking targets.

I am once again suffering from irregular sleep cycles.

On the blog this week: A [game review](/2025/02/hinterberg/)!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Still mostly just comics recently, lots of Spider-Man stuff, but also trying to catch up on everything else. **Wind and Truth** still moving along very slowly. (Has been the same update for months now!)

#### Watching

- Ongoing TV series I'm trying to keep up with: **Dragon Ball Daima**, **Sakamoto Days**, **Invincible S3**, **Abbott Elementary**. 
- Finished this week: **High Potential** (via Disney+)
- Started this week: **Elementary** on Prime Video. I am on a bit of a procedural binge apparently.
- Movies watched this week: [Venom: The Last Dance (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/venom-the-last-dance/).
- I am overdue for a movies/tv review post; might defer it to end of March and just do them every 3 months.

#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: **Marvel Snap**, **Magic Arena**, and even a bit of **Eternal Card Game** every so often. 
    - New Sanctum mode on Snap is kind of boring
- Finished single-player games: **Dungeons of Hinterberg** (review linked above)
- Ongoing single-player games: **Avowed**. Now that Hinterberg is done, I'm diving into this and as I expected, this kind of game just swallows me whole. I had to consciously step back to make sure I am not playing too much!

### Walking and Health

Google Fit tells me I walked 61,445 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday), a slight dip over last week's total. The culprit here is Saturday; I actually had healthy amounts of walking during the week, but circumstances meant I had to stay in for most of Saturday.

### Links to Share

Nothing this week. I have started to fall behind on my online reading and link processing!

### Looking Forward

- We might be able to attend another quiz night late in the week.
- Daredevil: Born Again (Mar04) !!!
- Wheel of Time S3 (Mar11)
