### Set Notes

- I think I read somewhere that Wilds of Eldraine wasn't considered a particularly good limited format, but I liked it, if only because it is so far my winningest Arena limited format since I started tracking. IDK what it is about the format, but certain archetypes just clicked for me.
- Admittedly, most of those wins were at Bronze. The last 2 quick draft trophies were after the season reset!
- Some archetypes I could never get to work though, like my records with RG and UW are terrible. I never even drafted UG or WG, those archetypes just seemed a bit boring. If you look at my archetype win rate, all of them were either good (60% or better) or really bad (50% or worse), there was no in-between.
- I think the whole role tokens thing is a home run design-wise. This single mechanic managed to support so many draft archetypes and increased the as-fan of enchantments without sacrificing other card types. I'm looking forward to what else they can do with this kind of approach.
- The bonus sheet for WOE was pretty sweet as well, I always loved being able to draft Hatching Plans even though I wasn't particularly good with Blue!
- The most annoying rare to fight against was without a doubt Gruff Triplets. I went 1-2 against that card and never managed to draft it myself.

*(Tangent/site meta note: As part of my effort to reduce the number of [notes](/notes/) entries on the site, I'm planning to change how I post about my MTG/Arena gaming. What I've been doing before was posting tweets/toots every time I stream or draft and including the results there with deck screenshots and all. But these days I am playing a lot more games than in my paper heyday, so posting about them all creates too many notes entries than I'm comfortable with. So in the limited recap post for each set, in addition to the stats I'm going to include useful information like the 7-x decks and such, and will delete all the related notes post so all my play info for the set is consolidated in one post. Some information will no longer be on the site, like which dates did I draft on, etc, though I have that raw data archived elsewhere. I also plan to go through the past limited recaps and update them accordingly, cleaning up old notes along the way. When the Arena stats email comes out, I'll post that info here as well instead of in a separate entry. Overall, this should reduce not only the number of notes entries, but also the number of images on the site.)*

### 7-x Sealed/Draft Decks

BW and BG were really the standout archetypes for me here. 

### Arena Open attempts

I ran two attempts for the September Arena Open and one for the October. None of them did particularly well.
