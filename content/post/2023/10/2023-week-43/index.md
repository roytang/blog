title: 2023 Week 43
---

It is the final weekend of October. Insert complaint about time passing by too quickly.

### The World

Sigh, the world continues to be terrible. Let's check back next week.

### My Week

This week was mostly chill. Some errands as usual. A family celebration or two. Went out for [a quiz night](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-league-4) in the middle of the week.

My weeks are starting to feel very same-y again; that's not really a bad thing?

No non-weeknotes blog posts this week, though I do hope to write more. I have managed to catch up on [Inktober 2023](/tags/inktober2023/) though!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: The ongoing RPGs took a back seat this week as I spent most of my gaming time on **Super Mario Bros Wonder**. I have already finished the game and am just doing completion stuff now and the only major thing left to do is completing the very brutal final final badge marathon stage. I believe I am already something like 150+ attempts in! My hands are so tired.
    - Online: Mostly just regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Even managed to do a draft of **Eternal**! I also did a Wilds of Eldraine Arena Open this weekend, but it didn't go anywhere (sigh).

- **Reading**: Finished reading Daredevil v1 (finally!), decided to go ahead with v2 as well, which is already turning out much, much better. I believe that after v2 I will have already read all the mainline Daredevil volumes until the present day! Still need to start a new book though.

- **Watching**: No movies this week! Still binging *Scrubs*, currently midway through season 5. Trying to keep up with *Loki*, *Star Trek Lower Decks* (season finale should be this week!). Finished *Harley Quinn* season 4. There's also some new stuff on NF and PV I want to watch. Argh, so much stuff to watch!

### Walking

Logged 52,848 steps this week, which is like 50% more than last week's total, around 75% of full capacity. I am not sure and this is mostly anecdotal but I feel like I get tired a lot more easily after this most recent bout with Covid, but we'll see if I manage to get back to full capacity, hopefully this week.

### Some Links of Interest

    > My career advice usually falls within the framework of doing the absolute minimum amount of work necessary to prevent starvation, and then doing something that’s not about money, completely outside of supporting structures, and not simply a matter of “consuming experience” with the remaining available time.

The backlog of saved links to read is still pretty long. Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Site Changes

- Content-wise, I was doing a lot of cleanup of the older/archived material from different socmed accounts (currently under [notes](/notes/)); mostly fixing bad imports due to bugs in my old import scripts. It got me thinking about whether all of these are worth archiving and the answer was probably not. There's a good number of frivoulous nonsense posts in there that could just be deleted. Need to think about it.
- No changes this week on the backend framework or frontend UI. Still thinking about redesign/reorg changes though. 
- Maybe I should write a blog post about it to help me think through all these things.
  
### Things I've been thinking about

Online backups, living in the past, my dad consistently mispronouncing tech terms even though I constantly correct him, trying for Nanowrimo again this year (without any prep?!?)

### Things I'm looking forward to

This coming week is a holiday-fest here in the PH. Tomorrow (Monday) is a holiday for the Barangay and SK elections (the hyperlocal political activity that I never participate in) and Wednesday the 1st and Thursday the 2nd are All Souls and All Saints Day, when Filipino families traditionally go to visit their departed loved ones (at their graves, not in the afterlife). The holidays don't actually affect me directly these days, but it does affect stuff like other people's or businesses' availability, traffic, etc.

Invincible season 2 is dropping on PV this week I believe, adding even more to the backlog of things I want to watch.
