title: "Star Wars Ahsoka"

The first(?) season of Ahsoka's show wrapped up this week. I'm glad I decided to finish [Star Wars Rebels](/2023/09/star-wars-rebels/) before starting this one, as it ends up being largely a continuation of the ending of Rebels. *(Finishing Clone Wars might have been even better, but I had trouble being that interested in the clones, maybe someday.)* I suppose it would be slightly problematic for people who haven't seen either prequel series, but they try their best to explain the relevant things.

This series was okay, gives us a good overview of the state of things in the New Republic after the original trilogy. The Huyang character is great. The new villains, Baylan Skoll and Shin, are fairly interesting with their mysterious agendas, though I guess that depends on where all of this leads. It was good to see Sabine again, older and angrier this time, although her eventual reunion with Ezra felt just a little bit awkward, like they were all "Now what?". Too bad we didn't see an appearance by Zeb.

It ended with more or less a cliffhanger, and we don't know where/how this story will continue. Is it branching off into two separate stories, with Thrawn back in the original galaxy and Ahsoka in the far-off galaxy? Will one of those be an Ahsoka season 2 and the other be the subject of Filoni's planned Star Wars film? I suppose we shall see!
