### The World

Sigh. Ukraine war isn't over and now we have this whole Israel-Hamas conflict escalating as well. So many people dying. The whole Middle East conflict is obviously complicated with a long history, but it shouldn't be a controversial opinion to be [against the conflict and in favor of saving lives](https://mastodonapp.uk/@ProjectFearlessness/111231847665079387).

### My Week

Now that I'm out of isolation, happy to be able to go out of the house again, if only to do some errands I had to put off for before. This week was mostly trying to get back into the grooves of my regular routine.

That, and trivia team also attend two quiz nights this week! We won [both](/2023/10/geekfight-noisy-standing/) of [them](/2023/10/popquiz-magic-mystics/)!

Still keeping up with [Inktober 2023](/tags/inktober2023/)!

On the blog: wrote about a conflict with [Grab Taxi](/2023/10/grabtaxi/), and also a longish post [on Social Media, Lurkers, Introverts, and Blogging](/2023/10/social-media-lurkers-introverts-blogging/).


### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Still playing **Baldur's Gate 3** and **Sea of Stars** regularly. **Xenoblade Chronicles 3** has kind of fallen by the wayside, but I still hope to pick it up again at some point. I have more or less given up hope of finishing any of these before *Super Mario Wonder* comes out.
        - Wrote [the review for Celeste](/2023/10/celeste/)!
    - Online: Mostly just regular grinding in **Magic Arena**, **Marvel Snap** and **Eternal**. Doing a couple more Wilds of Eldraine quick drafts in Arena this weekend, probably my last couple of drafts for the season.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is at a slightly-unhealthy 27 items. Still powering through Daredevil v1, currently well into the 90s (they're kinda terrible), and my pace has slowed. Should really start reading a new book at some point.

- **Watching**: Only watched one movie this week, and it was [Tenet (2020)](/2023/12/movies-sep-dec-2024/#tenet-2020). Watched a lot of TV though. Switched my binge-side-watching from House to *Scrubs*, since I've at least never seen all of Scrubs. Got caught up with *Star Trek Lower Decks*, started watching *My Adventures with Superman* (it's very anime!) and am somehow already behind on Loki.

### Walking

I was advised to take it easy, so I only logged a bit more than 14k steps this week. A far cry from my usual weekly target, but it's around 14 times more than what it was last week! Honestly, the little I did walk I felt a bit tired and out of breath; not sure if that's a lingering Covid thing or what. Still, hoping I can start ramping back up this coming week.

### Site Changes

- Been struggling with some performance issues on the site's server. Mostly database memory consumption occasionally spiking high and not coming back down unless the services get restarted. Been trying to figure it out. [Checking access logs for weird stuff](/2023/10/111228610330972210/). Applied some tweaks to improve query performance, reduce number of queries, etc.
- Related to above, was fiddling around with the site's RSS generation backend and I apologize [if it made all the posts reappear in your RSS reader](/2023/10/75e906a03fa80cddf1a205c785f3ab01/)
- Started to clean out Twitter references and integration, since I am mostly done with that site.
- For some reason, someone logged [a pull request on the repo that generates my Github profile](https://github.com/roytang/roytang/pull/1), and that led me to updating the script that generates the content of that repo, as some of the queries were outdated.

### Things I've been thinking about

Missed opportunities, what might have been, fighting for what's right, just wanting to sleep the day away, snacks

### Things I'm looking forward to

Super Mario Wonder is out this week! This is actually the first time that I already have the appropriate console for a new Mario game so I can buy it on release date. I have already pre-ordered!
