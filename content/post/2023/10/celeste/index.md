I've been wanting to play this one for the longest time, mostly because a while back I watched [this video about Level Design in Celeste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RlpMhBKNr0). It was free on the Epic Game Store for a while, but I never got around to actually installing the free games I got from there. Finally, it recently came to PC Game Pass, and with achievements too! I managed to get into it recently.

I knew what to expect coming in - it would be a brutal hardcore platformer with a lot of secrets and collectibles and stuff like that. It was indeed very challenging. I thought about recording a video or streaming on Twitch, but the game gave me so much trouble especially with the later stages that it soon became hard for me to play more than 15-30 minutes at a time before my hands started getting tired. Not sure if it's a sign of getting old! OTOH, that made it easy to pick up and play a few rooms whenever I had a few minutes free (which happened a lot [during the past week](/2023/10/2023-week-40/#my-week)).

I DIED SO MANY TIMES!! The game's "try -> die -> restart" loop is fairly tight and quick, so I was dying roughly every 10-15 seconds or something. When you die you respawn at the start of the "room" where you died, and most rooms are quite short, though there are a number of longer ones later on. (If you stop playing you can resume at the room you stopped at.) The more challenging rooms will require a lot of precise jumping and air-dashing. Often approaching a room had two steps: (a) figure out how to beat the room; and (b) actually execute the plan. As you can imagine, (b) was often more challenging than (a).

The rooms are grouped into chapters, and beating chapter 7 completes the main story. Each chapter has a certain theme and set of challenges/mechanics associated with it; I liked some more than the others, but they were all mostly interesting and innovative in some way. This kind of game is different from more forgiving platformers like Mario; you are expected to die and retry as needed so there can be more "one way" mechanics where going back is not an option.

The game includes collectible called strawberries that don't really do anything except that they are challenging to collect. I did not bother trying to find all the strawberries in each stage (some of them are well hidden), but those that I did find I gave a reasonable effort, unless I couldn't figure out step (a) above. The vast majority of my deaths were due to trying to collect strawberries!

**Story**: There is a reasonable story in there about coming to terms with your depression or inner demons or something. I wasn't particularly enthused by it.

**Completion**: Needless to say, I was not hoping for completion on this one. I did finish the main story (climbing the mountain!), but there is also a bunch of post-game stuff to unlock, and that requires going back through all the stages with a fine-toothed comb to get all the secret stuff and frankly I don't have time for that. I finished with 93/175 strawberries and frankly I'm surprised I got above 50% as I'm sure there were so many I missed. 

(For some reason, Game Pass play time is 3hrs more than the in-game play-time; I'm sure I didn't spend 3 hours in the menu! Or maybe I played so many short sessions the overall loading time ended up that long?)

I think I'll keep this one installed and maybe try to play it every so often to dig away at all those secrets? (This may only happen in some kind of fantasy-land where I don't have a bunch of other games I want to play.) 

Overall very happy to have played the game though completing it is definitely not for me.
