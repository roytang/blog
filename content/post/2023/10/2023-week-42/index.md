### The World

[Cold season officially began this week](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2023/10/21/2305368/cold-season-philippine-begins-palace) here in the PH, a welcome respite from the constant mid-day heat.

In what is ostensibly a plan to weed out bots, [Twitter is going to require a $1 annual fee in order to tweet](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/oct/18/x-twitter-1-dollar-annual-subscription-fee-new-users-elon-musk-new-zealand-nz-philippines); the PH is one of the countries piloting this. This will do nothing to discourage spammers who are famously willing to shell out money for domain names, and will do everything to prevent subscriber growth in this country where people dislike paying for anything. These days I honestly try not to think too much about Twitter's ongoing Musk-induced death spiral, but this one was a terrible strategy that affects my country directly.

### My Week

Finally got [a big medical errand done](/2023/10/111247980155626741/) that I've been trying to get done for a while. Hopefully that means less errands for the coming weeks.

The rest of the week was kind of chill. Mostly gaming and reading and trying to catch up on things. Had a fun halloween-themed family gathering this weekend, the kids had fun. No other blog posts this week!

I think I am a day or two behind on [Inktober 2023](/tags/inktober2023/), need to catch up.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - [Super Mario Bros Wonder has arrived](/2023/11/mario-wonder/#purchase)! (My preorder came with a tote bag.) I played a fair bit of it the past couple of days and am already in world 3, so I think that means I am 1/3rd of the way through the game already?
        - Also spent some time catching up on **Baldur's Gate 3** and **Sea of Stars**. Advancing the main quests!
    - Online: Mostly just regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. **Eternal** has a new set out, which I want to try drafting, I just need to find the time for it.

- **Reading**: Still powering through Daredevil v1, I think I am 30ish issues til the end of the volume. Looking forward to it, and honestly kind of tempted to keep going and read through the rest of the Daredevil main titles until the present day. The 2000s and up were great for the character, and I've already read most of the modern runs, so it shouldn't take too long maybe? Still haven't started any new books! Feed reader backlog is at a manageable 19 items, though I have added a bunch of new feeds this week, will see how that affects my pace.

- **Watching**: Only watched one movie this week, and it was [The Equalizer (2014)](/2023/12/movies-sep-dec-2023/#the-equalizer-2014). Still watching a lot of TV. *Scrubs* binge is almost done with season 3. Trying to keep up with *Loki*, *Star Trek Lower Decks*. Finished *My Adventures with Superman* and started *Harley Quinn* season 4. Will probably finish a few of these then write a bunch of reviews together.

### Walking

Logged 33,537 steps this week, which is more than double last week's total, but still less than 50% of full capacity. Hoping that the cooler weather makes it easier to take midday walks so that I can get back to speed this week, or close to it!

### Some Links of Interest
    
- [André Staltz - Google shattered human connection](https://staltz.com/google-shattered-human-connection): 

    > "What happens when connection is made unnecessary, while humans still infinitely crave for it? Social media. It’s a place where people go to feel connected and understood, but in reality they are just being fed atomic digestibles. These digestibles are tailored to their unique interests, but on a person-to-person level entirely disconnected."

Not a lot this week, I have fallen behind in going through my backlog of saved links to read. Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Site Changes

- Minor performance tweaks
- Fixes for bugs introduced after I made minor performance tweaks
- Cleaning up some old content on the site, mostly syndicated from other platforms. This also involved merging some directories in the source folder that should not have been separate in the first place.
- Thinking about doing a big backend re-org / re-write for performance purposes, which is almost certainly a terrible idea.

### Things I've been thinking about

Note taking, eating too much, headhunters, expenses, working again (?), printer paper sizes, what is and isn't worth keeping around in my archives, my inability to fall asleep at will

### Things I'm looking forward to

We have a quiz night scheduled this week, but not much else. Maybe I can have a good and relaxing week!
