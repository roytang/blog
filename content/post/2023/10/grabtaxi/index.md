Apparently if you take a GrabTaxi, you should check to make sure the driver inputs the correct fare on the app, or at least get a receipt or a photo of the final taximeter reading. Last night I took a GrabTaxi home and also used an offer that was 30% off and I was expecting the fare to end up around P230-P270. The way GrabTaxi works (as opposed to the usual GrabCar) is that the taxi runs their meter as normal, and Grab charges you an additional P59 fee (IDK how that's split between Grab and driver). I would have just flagged down a taxi normally, but I didn't have change, so being charged via Grab was easier. 

Anyway, I was in a hurry so I didn't check the fare the driver input into the app and was surprised to find that I was charged more than expected! I wondered if I had misunderstood the offer I availed and it was less P30 instead of 30%, but that didn't add up either. It wasn't a big amount so I considered just letting it go, but then I saw that Grab's emailed receipt had a link where I could complain about an incorrect fare. I sent in a complaint with the following details:

> The taxi meter was at P240+ at the end of the trip. +59 so I expected the total to be around P320, but I selected an offer that said 30% off, so I expected the fare to be around P224? Unfortunately I was not able to take a picture of the taxi meter. Even based on the time and distance in the grab receipt (attached), the meter reading should be 12km * 13.50 + 32mins*2 + 45 flag down + P59 grab fee is P330. P330 * 0.7 = P231 I was charged P291 instead. Not sure if I misunderstood the offer I selected, it is not reflected in the computation in the emailed receipt. (It shows the breakdown including discounted offers for GrabFood, so it really should do it for Grab Taxi as well.)

I wasn't really hopeful on getting a refund or anything, but I figured why not try? Earlier today I got a reply back and I was indeed refunded P60 and was told that the driver would be disciplined. That is not bad customer service for Grab! This was my first time contesting any charges with Grab, so it was a pleasant surprise.
