### The World

The Writers Guild of America strike is over, and it looks like complete victory for the writers. Unions work! Now hopefully SAG-AFTRA's strike can be resolved soon too so we can get more of that sweet, sweet Hollywood content lol.

Not an American, but I was kind of worried about the US federal government shutting down this weekend, mostly because that sort of thing tends to affect markets and maybe some of my investments. It looks like they have managed to narrowly avoid a shutdown though.

### Covid, Again

Late at night Thursday I was already feeling unusually cold; the rainy weather didn't help. By Friday afternoon I was running a fever. By Friday evening I had a positive antigen test result.

{{% photos 20230929_195915 %}}

The doctor's advise was to isolate for at least 5 days until I had 24 hours without a fever and a negative antigen test result. That mean isolating until Wednesday at least. This was fine, we already had a protocol at home, it wasn't our first rodeo. The last time I got Covid, the protocol was still two weeks isolation, so at least this is some improvement.

My bigger concern was to make sure I had not infected any of the other members of the household, all of whom are older than me. We had more antigen tests sent over Saturday morning, and I instructed my mom remotely how to use them. Thankfully, everyone else tested negative, though that's not a guarantee. Will ask them to retest probably Tuesday or if ever they get any symptoms. I have already ordered some more antigen tests so we have some extra for the retests this week.

So I've been holed up in my room all weekend, having meals brought to me. (Room service!) One would think being stuck in my room all day would be productive, but I also have been a bit low energy (understandable), so a lot of the past 48 hours has been spent sleeping. As of this morning, my fever appears to have broken and I'm not feeling chills anymore (need to observe a bit more to be sure) and my cough and colds seem to have calmed down a bit (they were really bad Friday night), so hopefully recovery is smooth from here. 

### My Week

I think my week was kind of typical, outside of the above. Not especially productive or anything. A bunch of errands, some side project work, that kind of thing. Had to buy new printer ink. Fixed some trouble with our cable TV.

It's been a while since I did this, but I bought a lotto ticket this past week. On a whim, mostly. I didn't win, of course, but part of me kind of breathed a sigh of relief when I didn't. Money would be nice of course (given recent family medical expenses), but the idea of winning the lotto and claiming the money and trying to stay safe and keep it all a secret, it can all be stressful / anxiety-inducing, especially in this country.

Ludum Dare started yesterday morning, but I was so preoccupied with the Covid I forgot about it until late in the day. I probably would not have had the energy anyway. Theme looks interesting though. ("Limited space")

On the blog: I wrote about the [AI Ouroboros](/2023/09/ai-ouroboros/), mostly to link-dump a bunch of AI-related articles.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still have 3 RPGs ongoing: **Baldur's Gate 3**, **Xenoblade Chronicles 3** and **Sea of Stars**. I'm wondering if it might be better to focus more effort on the last one first, since I think that one will be easiest to finish.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Another couple of [Wilds of Eldraine](/tags/mtgwoe) drafts this week, nothing too exciting. Initial previews are out for the next set already!
        - **Marvel Snap** regular grinding still going on. Season's about to end, hitting Infinite again is unlikely.
        - **Eternal** still only roughly once a week.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is at a slightly-unhealthy 28 items. I believe I have read close to 100 issues of Daredevil v1 this week. This brings me into Frank Miller's run, which is a marked improvement, the earlier issues were so bad, though [sometimes oddly prescient](/collections/comics/111138666200388561/). I really need to finish a book again soon though.

- **Watching**: Managed to watch a few movies this past week: [47 Ronin (2013)](/2023/12/movies-sep-dec-2023/#47-ronin-2013/), [Man on Fire (2004)](/2023/12/movies-sep-dec-2023/#man-on-fire-2004) and [Air (2023)](/2023/12/movies-sep-dec-2023/#air-2023). Also despite having a ton of other new content I could be watching, I started rewatching **House** this weekend, mostly because the Youtube algorithm kept giving me clips of the show. It's always been an excellent show for background watching, and seemed especially appropriate for someone under medical isolation.

### Walking

As you might imagine, I did not get much walking done Friday and Saturday. I did get enough done during the rest of the week to hit 55,548 steps for the rest of the week, which isn't too bad. Hopefully I can resume my walking by Thursday.

Hopefully Covid recovery goes well, because we have to attend a family event next weekend.

Also next weekend, there is a high-level sealed tournament a friend is asking if I want to attend, still deciding if I want to go. It has been so long since I've played in a real paper tournament!
