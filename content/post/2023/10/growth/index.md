I started reading the newspapers early in life, mostly during mealtimes (a bad habit I picked up from my father). Eventually I started reading the business sections as well. One of things that always mistified me back then was there would often be headlines about a company's profits being down and this was always treated as a big terrible thing and investors would be worried and whatever. My young adult mind didn't really understand: even if their profits were down by one percentage point or whatever, they were still turning a profit, so they're still... fine? We were talking about large multimillion- or maybe even billion- peso companies, not small neighborhood market stalls that might need to shut down if they can't make enough for rent this month. The kind of companies where they if took a million-peso loss for a given month they can just brush it off and still keep going indefinitely.

This was my first exposure to capitalism's unhealthy obsession with growth, growth, growth, where the line must always be going up.

As my understanding of economics grew (not that I claim to be any kind of expert!), I mostly understood where it was coming from - our world is constantly expanding. Inflation and population growth and entropy in general are inevitable, so economies have to constantly be growing as well to accomodate all these concerns. 

I was reminded of all these by the recently published ["Techno-optimist manifesto" by Silicon Valley VC Marc Andreessen](https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/) and all the discussion about it.

For the record, I agree with the concept of being optimistic that growth, technology and markets can help us overcome the problems of human society (and maybe are even critical to doing so). What I don't agree with is the declaration of concepts like sustainability, trust and safety, social responsibility, etc as "The Enemy". It smacks of a strong ["Greatness at any cost"](https://scryfall.com/card/rav/81/dark-confidant) vibe, which is of course, [a very Black-aligned philosophy](https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Black). It all sounds like a comic book mad scientist complaining that his ideas are ahead of his time and that society is holding him back.

Capitalism's obsession with growth has been very good at generating wealth, but very bad at actually distributing that wealth. The tendency has been, especially over the most recent decades, to make the rich richer, while the rest of us are exploited and pushed to the point of [burnout](/2020/02/burnout/) just trying to live our lives.

I understand the need for growth - and not just economically. Even on a personal level, it has always been my philosophy to try to be a lifelong learner, to always be growing in some way, and I certainly won't fault small or medium-size businesses for trying to grow their companies. But beyond a certain scale (like for a hypothetical example, if you were a billionaire VC), I like to imagine that there are more productive things to do than to find the next big thing you can exploit to grow your slush pile and maybe think about how you can help make sure no one is unnecessarily left behind by all this growth.

I'm rambling, probably. I have definitely soured on capitalism during the last decade or so. An attitude of "growth at all costs" seems foolish in the same way as "sacrificing liberty for security". You don't always need to be hustling.

Anyway, there are a bunch of excellent responses to this manifesto online, much better worded than mine. A couple I've found that I bothered to save:

- [Ed Zitron tearing apart this manifesto](https://wheresyoured.at/p/everything-looks-like-a-nail)

Not really in response, but somewhat related:
