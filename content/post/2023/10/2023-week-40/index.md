### The World

I'm sure stuff has been happening this week, but I haven't really cared too much. Felt like more of the same. Trump being in court. Elon being an idiot and driving Twitter into the ground. Some Hamas attack in Israel, lots of people dead. Our VP engaging in the "if you're not with us, you're against us" rhetoric after losing her confidential funds. Maybe I'm forgetting some things.

### My Week

After the positive antigen test two Fridays ago, I spent the entire week cooped up in my room. I was hoping my isolation period would end after the minimal 5 days, but my antigen test still came out positive last Wednesday. I was clear of fever by then but still had a bit of nasal congestion. Kept re-testing every two days and finally got a negative result today just after lunch today, so I am finally free!

One would think that being stuck in my room all day for a week would at least make me productive in terms of stuff I can do at my desk and/or computer, but honestly I just ended up spending most of my time reading comics and watching stuff and lying around.

I did manage to start doing [Inktober 2023](/tags/inktober2023/) though.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Still have 3 RPGs ongoing: **Baldur's Gate 3**, **Xenoblade Chronicles 3** and **Sea of Stars**. I am kind of considering setting aside one of these for a while, most likely Xenoblade Chronicles 3.
        - Apparently those 3 were not enough, so I decided to also start playing **Celeste**, which is brutally hard. I am close to the end I think, but I am already at more than 2,000 deaths lol.
    - Online: Mostly just regular grinding in **Magic Arena**, **Marvel Snap** and **Eternal**. No infinite in Snap this month.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is at a slightly-unhealthy 33 items. Still powering through Daredevil v1, currently well into Nocenti's run. Still haven't started any new books!

- **Watching**: Being stuck in my room means I watched a lot of stuff this week. Caught up with my "poorly-reviewed superhero films" watchlist with [Fantastic Four (2015)](https://roytang.net/2023/10/fantastic-four-2015/), then caught up with this year's watch list with [Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/10/transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-2023/) and [Blue Beetle (2023)](https://roytang.net/2023/10/blue-beetle-2023/). Also finished [Star Wars: Ahsoka](https://roytang.net/2023/10/ahsoka/) this week, and started on S2 of Loki. Also managed to rewatch more than two seasons of House, not in any logical order.

### Walking

I spent the entire week in my room, so not a lot of walking. Writing the total here just for formality's sake: 1,052 steps.

I've also been advised to take it easy for the next couple of weeks, so I don't expect to be walking too much for a while.

### Site Changes

- Did a surprise backend update to Django 4.2 this weekend, mostly because I wanted to install some profiling tool that needed a higher Django version. Upgrade went down surprisingly easily actually.
- Or so I thought? This morning I woke up to find the server was down and after some investigation found it was out of disk space for some reason! Spent some time cleaning up disk space and set up monitoring alerts for disk space. 
- Also did minor fixes to make sure the site returns 404 when really needed (for example, if you try to access a nonexistent tag), started cleaning up old Twitter integrations now that I'm no longer using that site. A few other minor UI fixes.

### Things I've been thinking about

Art, poetry, resting, recovery, low energy/productivity, financials, working again, isolation, weird dreams, climbing a mountain, nostalgia, 

### Things I'm looking forward to

I got cleared just in time because we have two quiz nights we have to attend this week! 

There's also a bunch of errands that I had to put off because of the Covid, hopefully I can get all of those done today.
