I enjoyed season 2 of *Star Trek: Strange New Worlds* even more than season 1, enough to try something strange and new: I'll do per episode reviews! Maybe I'll become one of those Trekkies that knows all the episode titles by heart or something.

### S2E01 The Broken Circle - 3/5

This was okay, felt like standard Trek fare of disobeying orders to get stuff done. Kind of weird for the season opener to ditch Pike though.

### S2E02 Ad Astra Per Aspera - 5/5

Easily my favorite episode of the season, because I love lawyer shows and therefore love it even more when Star Trek has a lawyer episode, and this was a great one. Some really tense moments and swings back and forth between Number One's emotional testimony, to the Vulcan prosecutor's counterstroke, to the brilliant turnaround in the closing remarks. 

### S2E03 Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow - 4/5

This was a pretty good time travel episode where they get to visit modern times, and introduces the Kirk / La'an subplot.

### S2E04 Among the Lotus Eaters - 3/5

Felt like the standard Trek "land on another planet and get into trouble" episodes, this time focusing on one of Pike's earlier failures.

### S2E05 Charades - 4.5/5

A great comedic episode focused around Spock and T'Pring; I assume [we are getting one of those per season](/2022/07/weeknotes-07-17/resource/strangenewworlds.png/details/). Captain Pike's silent cringe expressions as Spock tries to deal with his future MIL really sell the comedy here.

### S2E06 Lost In Translation - 3/5

See E04 above.

### S2E07 Those Old Scientists - 5/5

I'm a fan of *Lower Decks* as well, so [I really enjoyed this crossover](/2023/07/110762663445495965/). Seeing Boimler and Mariner in live action was great, and Jack Quaid especially just completely nailed Boimler's animated mannerisms.

### S2E08 Under the Cloak of War - 2.5/5

This is one of those episodes meant to portray the "horrors of war"; I get what they were going for but I almost never like this sort of episode, it's just not really my thing. Plus I didn't like how this episode ended, it felt very tonally out of place for the show. This is my least favorite episode of the season.

### S2E09 Subspace Rhapsody - 4/5

It would've been really easy to screw this up, but I'd call this a successful musical episode. I'm sure the most rewatched part is that bit with the Klingons towards the end.

### S2E10 Hegemony - 4/5

Honestly was assuming this Gorn encounter would be similar to epsiodes 4 and 6, the usual dangerous encounter on a remote world. This was so much better than what I was expecting; it's suspenseful and exciting and the intro of another classic character was a nice touch. The cliffhanger was well done as well, although I have questions.

Whatever questions will have to wait a while though; it sounds like S3 may be delayed due to the writer's strike so it may take a while for us to find out what happens to Pike and crew. This show continues to be the best of modern Trek.
