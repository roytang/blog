title: New Phone Loadout
---

I recently had to setup a new phone without the benefit of having the older phone to copy stuff over from. I thought I'd document the apps that I installed so I could have a reference/checklist for when I need to do this again. 

(I used to make these sorts of checklists back in the days when I regularly re-installed desktop OSes!)

- Everything Apps
    - Firefox: Browsers, the original everything app
    - Grab: Mostly for transpo and food delivery
- Communication
    - Viber: Popular messaging app locally
    - Messenger: Sadly, I have failed at getting people to stop using Messenger
    - Discord: This is the primary way I talk to the [trivia team](/tags/quiznight)
- Reading
    - Flipboard: Magazine app. I usually read this while eating
    - Inoreader: RSS reader
    - Tusky: Mastodon client
    - Kindle: I used to only read eBooks on my iPad, but I've come around to eBook reading on the Phone
- Entertainment
    - Netflix: Sometimes I like to watch without getting up from bed
    - Spotify: I don't use this on mobile very much though
- Notes
    - Google Keep: Been using this as my go-to notes app for a while now
- Health
    - Fitbit: Might stop using this soon
    - Google Fit: Replacement for step counting
- Learning
    - Duolingo: Current streak is at 1600+ days!
- Finance
    - GCash: Meh. This one came pre-installed.
    - Maya: Probably better than GCash at this point
    - BPI: Needed because certain transactions require the mobile app as 2FA
    - Vybe by BPI: BPI credit cards redemption is only through this app
    - GlobeOne: Mostly used for checking my account status, since Globe no longer provides that service on the web
    - Lazada: This one came pre-installed. I only kept it around so that I could get messaging notifs since I've been arguing with sellers recently
- Games
    - NYT Games: Mostly to make sure I can keep up my daily crossword streak. Currently at 600+ days!
    - Marvel Snap: Quick and easy games are useful for passing the time if I'm waiting somewhere
- Others
    - Instagram: Uh, I keep this around for reasons.

Also asked some friends for new mobile wallpaper suggestions and settled [on this Spider-Gwen one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Amoledbackgrounds/comments/15a1s5m/spiderverse_gwen_stacy_spidergirl_2500x6000/).
