#### Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)

<time id="guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-2023">[2023-05-06 13:38] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/7/9/7/1/1/379711-guardians-of-the-galaxy-volume-3-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bd023e472c" /></p> <p>Feels like this had a darker, more somber and much more emotional tone than the first two films. A very hateable villain, especially for animal lovers. The Guardians crew are at the best they've ever been; the banter and the coordination fighting alongside each other are a testament of how they've grown together as a found family. The films gives a fitting end to the story arcs for most of our Guardians crew.</p><p>Some plot nitpicks here and there, and my brother though the film was just a tad too long, but nothing too problematic. James Gunn has more or less stuck the landing on his final MCU film.</p>

#### Police Story 3: Super Cop (1992)

<time id="police-story-3-super-cop-1992">[2023-05-15 13:18] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/5/5/7/2/45572-police-story-3-super-cop-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3c5469ed8d" /></p> <p>Watched this only because I heard young Michelle Yeoh was in it, then realized afterwards that I've never actually seen Police Story 2.</p><p>It was fine, lots of good fighting and stunts as would be expected. Michelle Yeoh looks so different especially during the earlier scenes; I think if I had seen this blind it might have taken me a while to recognize her. She did great though.</p><p>I think I like the original Police Story a bit more; like the bus sequences in the third act of the first film were a bit more interesting than the train sequences here. Though it is nice that Jacky has someone else on his side who can do kung fu.</p>

#### The Raid (2011)

<time id="the-raid-2011">[2023-05-23 12:13] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/8/2/6/6/78266-the-raid-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=4095a2a23a" /></p> <p>Intense and action-packed, great fight scenes</p>

---

#### Mystic River (2003)

<time id="mystic-river-2003">[2023-05-25 13:13] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/7/3/7/51737-mystic-river-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7c4cbb89ba" /></p> <p>I forget why I added this to my list but wow such a good film with magnificent performances. Sean Penn and Tim Robbins were great in this, and even a lot of the supporting cast were great. A dark and tragic tale of loss and trauma and vengeance and endless cycles of violence</p>

---

#### The Mummy (1999)

<time id="the-mummy-1999">[2023-06-05 01:18] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/5i/du/2g/s8/6CweTLmngcPrsEH4G6RKvdwmQdC-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=397ac4a555" /></p> <p>When I told my friends I'd never seen this film before they told me it's fun so I watched it. It was indeed fun, but not as fun as I'd hoped and I feel like my expectations were set too high. I think I was expecting more Indiana Jones type hijinx and instead got body horror and cheesy 90s CGI.</p><p>That being said, still very entertaining; Fraser and Weiss gave good performances that prevented the movie from being too cheesy. I like how the protag starts out rough and a bit belligerent but comes around to show he really cares about the girl. </p><p>I was thinking about also watching the Tom Cruise remake, but I read that Fraser said it was "less fun" than the original so maybe not.</p>

#### Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)

<time id="spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-2023">[2023-06-06 23:41] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/7/6/3/1/497631-spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=365d59f809" /></p> <p>A fantastic follow-up to the original 2018 movie, further developing Miles and expanding on Gwen's back story as well. Fantastic use of animation not only to portray the different universes, but as also as a storytelling tool to convey emotion, tone and depth. Also I must commend the marketing for preparing trailers that while they showed a lot of the fun stuff in the films, never spoiled any of the deeper plot moments or the cause of the ultimate conflict that arises between Miles and the other Spiders. Looking forward to Beyond the Spider-verse next year!</p>

#### The Flash (2023)

<time id="the-flash-2023">[2023-06-24 13:06] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/2/5/8/4/5/225845-the-flash-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=be50db18ec" /></p> <p><em>This review may contain spoilers.</em></p> <p>So, The Flash aka "Miguel told you now to screw around with canon events!" Maybe minor spoilers here.</p><p>First off the controversial lead, but I won't speak towards anything outside the film. Their performance was decent, especially considering most of the time they were their own scene partner.</p><p>The Flash suit looks so weird and bulky especially when uncharged. I liked his plated suit from JL a lot more.</p><p>Keaton's older Bruce Wayne is the highlight of this film though. A manic and delightfully reckless performance. Sasha Calle does well as the very angry Supergirl, though her arc isn't very long and always ends in tragedy.</p><p>Not a fan of retrocausality in my time travel, but I am amazed at how they timed the whole spaghetti explanation to just after I complained about it. Also, the audacity to both cite and modify BTTF, drawing into that film's casting history, as the prime example of consequences. This was excellent.</p><p>A lot of people mentioned how the CGI was weird, but most of the weird CGI was stuff happening in Flash-time or in the time bubble, and I felt like that was fine, stylistically as a choice?</p><p>The initial Flash-time sequence at the Gotham hospital would have been amazing had the X-Men movies not already done TWO similar sequences with Quicksilver many years ago (and with better backing music to boot!) </p><p>There is very little in common with the actual Flashpoint comics storyline but I do appreciate the little that was there. That they tried to recreate the Flash accident the same way was great.</p><p>It's a superhero film so the final act was mostly a big battle sequence, but this one never got a satisfying ending because of how the plot had to go. </p><p>I thought the CGI cameos were fine and not disrespectful or anything (assuming they cleared it with the estates etc). It's not like Star Wars hasn't done similar before.</p><p>I laughed heartily at the final cameo after Barry leaves the courthouse.</p><p>Iris West felt like such a non-character.</p><p>My brother said it felt like they were going for something closer to the MCU level of humor here.</p><p>That post-credits scene felt useless.</p><p>Overall I think the movie was fine, though it was very much a superhero movie. Not sure it deserved to flop, though I guess that means Miller is unlikely to come back as Barry Allen.</p><p>It doesn't really feel like it "ended" the current DCEU incarnation. I was kind of expecting some kind of crisis event at the end that told us their multiverse was being rewritten or something. Might have been too much to ask for a "mainstream" movie. Well, we'll see what James Gunn brings us.</p>

#### Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One (2023)

<time id="mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-2023">[2023-07-12 21:38] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/3/4/0/2/503402-mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=800fc297c1" /></p> <p>Each Mission Impossible seems to have a signature stunt/scene to remember it by, like the hanging from the ceiling bit in the first film or climbing the Burj Khalifa in Ghost Protocol. This one for sure will be remembered by the bike jump off the cliff; it's only too bad it was heavily promoted in trailers and previews, so there is little to no surprise when he actually does it in the film.</p><p>I liked the set pieces in Rome and the final train sequence (though it reminds me of a certain Playstation game.) Venice felt weak. The rest was okay.</p><p>Decent performances all around, even though all the exposition bits felt a bit stretched out. Cruise does his usual thing, though I feel like his age is starting to show a bit. (He has been doing these films for 27 years now!) At first I did not recognize that one lady as Pom Klementieff, although I've only ever seen her as Mantis so that's unsurprising.</p><p>The plot is pretty straightforward ("find the mcguffin"), enough so that my parents who I watched the film with had minimal questions for me afterwards. (They were mostly confused with the how and why of Pom Klementieff's character!)</p><p>All in all an entertaining film.</p>

#### Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022)

<time id="puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-2022">[2023-07-25 00:42] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/4/2/2/8/5/242285-puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9e9109c5cd" /></p> <p>Watched the first half of this with my niece a couple of months ago, finally decided to finish it today. Kind of by-the-numbers plot, but it's a fun adventure with clever adaptations of classic fairy tales (as we've come to expect from the Shrek franchise) + some truly vibrant, fantastic and unique animations that more than make up for it.</p>

---

#### Soul (2020)

<time id="soul-2020">[2023-07-25 00:43] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/8/5/1/1/438511-soul-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=8d0b74f9a8" /></p> <p>Watched the first half of this with my niece about a month ago and finally decided to finish it today. I had zero idea what this film was about and thought it would be about jazz and music and such, but it turned out to be about life and death and living and inspiration and purpose. It's okay and the ending is kinda sweet but it feels a bit average for a Pixar film.</p>

---

#### Hidden Strike (2023)

<time id="hidden-strike-2023">[2023-08-10 21:11] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/8/9/2/7/1/389271-hidden-strike-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=9b5b927394" /></p> <p>Kinda fun, and Cena and Jacky have a bit of chemistry going but the plot is all over the place and I don't even think they accomplished anything of use in the end? (except maybe vengeance?)</p>

---

#### Heart of Stone (2023)

<time id="heart-of-stone-2023">[2023-08-15 23:34] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/4/6/9/5/5/646955-heart-of-stone-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6c3ce8a087" /></p> <p>My mom's review: I didn't really understand, but I liked the action. Gal Gadot is so good! </p><p>(I think she meant the character is hypercompetent.)</p><p>The film obviously goes for the Mission Impossible vibe with the action sequences and set pieces, though the story here is a bit like the opposite of Dead Reckoning. The plot here was a bit rough around the edges but the action was good and I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. And honestly, I think Gal Gadot's acting is starting to get a bit better.</p>

#### Young Frankenstein (1974)

<time id="young-frankenstein-1974">[2023-08-21 23:58] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/9/3/1/49931-young-frankenstein-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=e33efca8ce" /></p> <p>My dad wanted to see this so I ended up watching it too. I remember seeing bits and pieces of this from when I was young, like the lead wanting his last name to be pronounced differently. There are a lot of wink wink bawdy jokes that I wouldn't have gotten as a kid though. Good for a few laughs. The monster was Everybody Loves Raymond's dad!</p>

---

#### Street Kings (2008)

<time id="street-kings-2008">[2023-08-23 00:34] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/1/1/6/51116-street-kings-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7ac0bc21e1" /></p> <p>Watched this one just because it was in the NF top 10. Action and suspense were fine, but it's hard to be supportive or sympathetic towards the protags when everyone is a dirty cop. Mastermind was kind of obvious early on. House and Sgt Jeffords are here!</p>

#### Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)

<time id="lupin-the-third-the-castle-of-cagliostro-1979">[2023-08-23 23:52] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/4/2/7/42427-lupin-the-third-the-castle-of-cagliostro-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=e3e82cede0" /></p> <p>I haven't actually seen a lot of Lupin III, I mostly watched this because it was Miyazaki's directorial debut. As such I didn't expect much but it was a fun, enjoyable and well-animated romp.</p>
