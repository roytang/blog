title: What is a 'Zero Interest Rate Phenomenon'?
---

{{% note "/2023/07/110770201417191771/" %}}

I come across this term sometimes on social media, where people jokingly say something is a "zero interest rate phenomenon". I wasn't sure what it means as I am a layman and don't follow economics too closely. And a search reveals no easy answers. Bing's AI chat could only describe "zero interest rate policy", but not the implications of the "phenomenon" phrase.

After reading a bit about it, I thought I'd note my understanding. A "zero interest rate policy" happens when central banks set interest rates very low, close to zero, in order to encourage investments. This means the cost of borrowing money is cheap, so companies are typically more flush with cash and investors are more likely to invest in riskier ventures, and so on.

This is kind of an "easy mode" era; since money is cheap, companies were more willing to spend money so it was easy to get jobs, there were more perks, etc. The zero interest rate era went on for a relatively long time, so many were convinced it could go on forever, and many employees didn't know anything other than a zero interest rate environment. This also encouraged companies that were going for "growth at all costs", even if they weren't profitable, since they could easily get funding to keep going just based on their large userbases.

However, during the past couple of years, interest rates have started to rise again. (Probably due to succession of world crisis we have had recently, but I'm not brave enough to claim sufficient knowledge there.) This means money is starting to tighten up and companies need to cut costs. This means layoffs (lots of those in the tech sector the last couple of years), cutting down on perks, less investment money going to riskier startups, etc. Even big companies like Netflix are obviously trying to cut costs and raise pricing. Basically the era of easy money is over.

So, saying something is a "zero interest rate phenomenon" is saying it was only possible in the era of "easy money", basically implying it's a frivolous luxury that will be discarded when money is tight. Jokingly saying something like "pants were a zero interest rate phenomenon" implies pants were never really important, something like that.

(I hope I understood this one correctly!)
