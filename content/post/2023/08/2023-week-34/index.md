title: 2023 Week 34
---

The upcoming week is the last week of August. That means we are heading in the last third of 2023. Time continues to fly by, unrelenting.

### The World

Donald Trump once again dominating the news cycles this week, at first for skipping the first GOP primary debate, but late in the week for surrendering and having his mugshot taken in Georgia. While I understand celebrating this man's legal woes can be cathartic, at the same time I'm worried that giving him too much attention is just adding fuel to his fire. While this is US politics, a Trump reelection should rightfully worry those of us in the rest of the world as well.

### My Week

This past week was a bit lazy. Managed to catch up on some sleep. Still had to go to the hospital a couple of times to pick up test results. It looks like a family member will need surgery =/

Re-reading a journal entry from last Sunday morning and I was just so angry at myself for some stupid things I'd done. I'm past that now I think.

Spent some time digging through old Google Photos archived from the early aughts up to 2015. Categorizing, discarding duplicates, deciding which ones to keep etc. Some made it into this blog as back-dated notes (I'm not linking to them though). 

I will say I made a page to [archive all the mobile wallpapers I've ever used](/page/galleries/mobile-wallpapers/), in case I want to use them again. (I'll try to add some source citations when I can find them...)

Trivia team attended a [Geekfight](/tags/geekfight) league game this week, but I did not join as it was about Taylor Swift. Still, the team won! Good job! This puts us at the head of the league!

On the blog: I wrote about [my new phone loadout](/2023/08/new-phone-loadout/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - **Baldur's Gate 3**: almost 30 hours in, and we are still in Act 1!
        - **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**: I finally hit 100% completion on this game! Will write the review post this week then I can move on.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Same old regular constructed grinding still. There is a nice all-access no-banned-list Historic event going on right now which is kinda fun. (I have already gotten [Channel](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/157/channel)-[Emrakul](https://scryfall.com/card/emn/6/emrakul-the-promised-end)'ed twice.) *Wilds of Eldraine* drops in less than two weeks!
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Saving up spotlight caches, etc.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Setting aside this game for a bit as I have lost interest. Will probably pick it up again later at some point.

- **Reading**: Finished reading my Avengers runs, so I wrote [a new complete marvel run blog post about it](/2023/08/marvel-run-5-avengers-etc/). My book reading has slowed down a bit though. Feed reader backlog is at a health 13 items.

- **Watching**: Managed to watch 3 movies this week: [Young Frankenstein (1974)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#young-frankenstein-1974), [Street Kings (2008)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#street-kings-2008), and [Lupin the Third: The Castle of Cagliostro (1979)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#lupin-the-third-the-castle-of-cagliostro-1979). TV-wise, *Ahsoka* is out on Disney+, but I decided to go through all 4 seasons of **Star Wars Rebels** first. I'm already a bit into season 2, it's fairly good!

### Walking

I've switched to using the Google Fit to track my steps. This has the obvious upside of not needing to wear a tracker on my wrist and the obvious downside of needing to carry my phone with me all the time. From testing, it seems I can no longer accurately measure calories burned unless I explicitly track my walks as a workout, and I don't trust myself to do so consistently, so I'll just give it up. The step count seems reasonably accurate, comparing similar distances I've walked with Fitbit. Maybe slightly higher than what Fitbit would have given me (5% at most), but what's important is that it's consistent.

Google Fit tells me I walked 71,397 over the past week. Go me!

### Some Links of Interest

- [Edith Sampson — Figures of Speech](https://www.speech.almeida.co.uk/edith-sampson): "Choose One of Five", commencement address from 1965.

    > And then, finally, there's choice five. It's hard to state this one. About as close as I can come to it is this: Hang loose, but stay vibrantly alive.

    > Choice five would demand of you that you consider today's graduation no more than a pause to catch your breath before continuing the life-long job of education. It would demand of you that you be your own unique best self. And there is no higher demand that that.

I could probably a benefit from the strategy of simply letting myself not finish books as this article advises

### Things I've been thinking about

Pedantry, overreacting, taking things personally, being lazy, purgatory, poorly implemented autocompletes, old photos, typos, weird dreams, Riverdale, sando vs vest (UK), McDonald's, immigration departure requirements, etc etc

### Things I'm looking forward to

- One Piece live action drops on Netflix this week! Cautiously optimistic about this one.
