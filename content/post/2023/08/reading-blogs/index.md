I recently caught myself reading blog posts more and more diagonally instead of vertically. This evolution has a couple of reasons: our daughter is a time-sucking vampire, my RSS reader has too many subscribed feeds, my interests are shifting towards less technical blogs, some posts have zero content relevant to me, some posts are just too damn long, and some bloggers churn out posts faster than I can blink my eyes.

For me, this is the natural way to read blogs. When I follow or read a blog, I don't expect every post to be relevant to me (otherwise, that blog would be written by me!). Blogs aren't one-to-one conversations where it would be rude to turn away when the other person is excitedly enumerating the joys of his hobbies. Blogs are a broadcast medium, more like magazines where some articles are of interest and many are not, and you can glance over the titles and summaries to find out which is which. That makes it similar to social media feeds where you don't really have to read everything that passes by your feed. In the same way that [you can choose to write about anything on your blog](/2023/06/write-anything/), you can also pick and choose what to read, it's your time after all. 

I suppose the fear about the concept of "glancing" is that you might accidentally miss out on something that is high quality. I get that - but you can mitigate that a bit by following blogs that regularly post collections of links to share, since good posts always tend to find their way around. I almost never skip such posts.

I do agree that having too many feeds on your reader can be a problem though. I tend to use categories to manage my feed reading. My feed reader tends to have three general categories for blogs I follow:

1. "Blogroll" - these are blogs I enjoy and they are listed publicly on the [blogroll page](/page/blogroll) on this site. They generally post a moderate amount and have a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio for me, and I generally don't mind reading most of the posts here, or are at least skimming.
2. "Magazine" - these are higher volume blogs (they post a lot) and usually have lower signal-to-noise ratio, and I will typically skip over posts depending on the title or even mark the entire category as read as needed. An example of a feed I have in this category would be [the Metafilter feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Metafilter).
3. "Tentative" - these are new blogs that I am tentatively following that I may later move to one of the other two categories. Admittedly, I am very lax at evaluating the blogs in this list and am probably due for a blogroll update soon.

Aside from maintaining the tentative category, I also regularly prune the lists as needed, for various reasons. Humans have a limit on the number of contacts they can reasonably manage (see: [Dunbar's number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)), and I suspect there is a similar limit for blogs you follow, so regular pruning is a must.

I have been doing relatively well in keeping my unread counts low; I usually end each day with less than 20 unread items, and sometimes it gets above 50 or maybe even a 100 and I know I have to sit down and power through a few categories.
