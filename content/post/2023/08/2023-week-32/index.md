### The World

Honestly been a bit too pre-occupied to note what's been happening with the world lately, but I did notice that excitement for the LK99 supposed room temperature semiconducator has died down. There is [a wikipedia article about it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LK-99) though!

### My Week

This past Wednesday was [my fourty-fifth](/2023/08/forty-five/). A couple of days before that I went ahead and [renewed my driver's license](/2023/08/110847244216804146/) (which I never use actually.)

I am ready to move on from [the incident a couple of weeks ago](/2023/08/110847244216804146/), as it looks like there is nothing more worth pursuing (I have been talked down from seeking vengeance), though I might have a bit more to write about platform security, etc.

Trivia team attended [a Geekfight last Wednesday](/2023/08/geekfight-nonbeliever/); was hoping some birthday luck would get us to first place but no dice. I knew as soon as this event was scheduled that I would be paying for dinner.

A few medical errands this week still, a consequence of earlier bad news. Buying meds, getting test results, having follow-up tests done. Might be busy with this sort of thing for the few weeks or so.

Kind of caught up with some old friends I hadn't spoken to in a while, with promises of meeting up soon. Who knows if those promises will come to pass?

I really should remember to just never dabble in stocks during the ghost month.

### Site Updates

Honestly I'm supposed to be working on a general site redesign, but that's kind of fallen by the wayside in light of other priorities. I am still making minor improvements though. Today I worked on something minor I've been meaning to for a while: Adding a [robots.txt](/robots.txt). I've been meaning to do this for a while, ever since I read a post from Tracy Durnell (see links below) and was reminded to finally do it by a [recent post from maya.land](https://maya.land/updates/2023/08/12/update-open-vs-hidden.html). The "first draft" robots.txt I've deployed is mainly cribbed from those two sites.

*Edit: 3 hours after publishing this post.* I just realized I have been publishing RSS feeds without publication dates! What an oversight! Normally not a problem when I publish normally, but sometimes I will insert a post back-dated because I want it to be set at a specific date, and without the `pub_date`, feed readers will just show it as a new post. This has been fixed (hopefully).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - I am less than 15 hours into **Baldur's Gate 3** as it has only been out for a week, yet I'm pretty sure that's slightly less hours than a friend played on his first 24 hours.
        - Still playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**; I have finished the main story and apparently there's an epilogue I have to complete for 100% quest completion (I am currently at 92%), I believe I will try to do that before closing the book on the game.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Same old regular constructed grinding still. Saving up resources for Wilds of Eldraine next month!
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Finished below 90 last season, hopefully we do better this season.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Still struggling but maybe getting a bit better.

- **Reading**: Still reading: *Saving Time* by Jenny Odell. It's slow going as the book is very dense, but I like the ideas being discussed. Am close to the end of West Coast Avengers v1, though I was disappointed to find out that [the run is NOT complete on Marvel Unlimited](/2023/08/15o9ubc/). Feed reader backlog is currently at a very healthy 11 items.

- **Watching**: Watched [Hidden Strike](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#hidden-strike-2023) for some reason. *Strange New Worlds S2* finale was this week as well, I wrote [an episode-by-episode review of the season](/2023/08/strange-new-worlds-s2/).

### Walking

Early on Tuesday morning, I had trouble syncing my Fitbit and thought I'd try to remove the device from the app and re-pair it in case that makes things better. Except apparently doing that in the app removes the device from my account completely and I would need to re-pair it again, which requires reading a 4-digit code on the tracker. Except my tracker's display has been broken for a few months now! (I have only been getting my step counts from the app.) So due to my own idiocy I was stuck with a Fitbit tracker that I couldn't use. 

I took the opportunity to take a "rest week" while I waited for a replacement Fitbit to arrive. So I don't have walking stats for this past week, and even if I did they would be terrible as I took the excuse to be lazy. I got the replacement Fitbit yesterday, so hopefully this week I can get back to my regular targets.

You’re pushing yourself. Don’t assume you know everything, but try your best anyway, and let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong. Wear your noobyness on your sleeve."

### Things I've been thinking about

Weekly reviews, asking for support/donations, starting my own subtack/newsletter?!?, me being idiotic, birthdays and birthday greetings and friends I hadn't spoken to in a while, aspirations, finding optimism in the face of adversity, perceptions of time, being untethered and unmeasured, ephemerality and permanence, crabs.

### Things I'm looking forward to

- We have yet another quiz night on Wednesday!
- Still hoping for a good week.
