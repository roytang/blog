### The World

This past week, Tweetdeck (I refuse to call it "XPro") became inaccessible unless you were a Twitter Blue subscriber. ([As promised, though a bit late.](https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1675990712297443330)). This was the second of [two "red lines" that would make me quit Twitter](/2022/12/thoughts-on-twitter/) (the other being cutting off API access, which [already happened a few months ago](/2023/05/110420318576923027/)). I'm still not deleting my account, but I am for all intents and purposes no longer there. I have not bothered re-installing the app on my new phone, and after [the incident](/2023/08/stolen-phone-post-mortem/) Twitter was one of the accounts whose passwords I reset and I never bothered re-logging in on all other devices except on my main desktop. On my main desktop, I have removed Tweetdeck from my default tabs. Now I will only see Twitter if I go there manually.

### My Week

This week was a bit mid. My recent streak of bad luck with hardware continued and we're still waiting on medical updates, but on the other hand the trivia team [crushed a quiz night last Wednesday](/2023/08/geekfight-select/) and I did get some work done on side projects.

I got a permanent replacement phone via plan renewal from Globe, got the unit last Thursday. It's a Samsung A54; should be a slight upgrade over the phone I was using before the incident, a Samsung A50.

In the interim I was using a Xiaomi POCO X3 NFC handed down by my brother, but I dislike Chinese phones in general and was eager to be rid of it. After I had set up my new phone I factory reset the Xiaomi one to give it to my mom. For months now she'd been using an even older Chinese phone that had literally zero free space. I had originally been planning to give her my old A50 when I did my plan renewal, now she gets to stick to Xiaomi instead.

Trying to blog more this past week:

- I wrote about [Kurt Vonnegut and farting around](/2023/08/vonnegut/).
- I wrote about [how to read a blog](/2023/08/reading-blogs/), in response to someone else's blog post.
- I wrote about [closing the book on the stolen phone incident](/2023/08/stolen-phone-post-mortem/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - I am a couple of weeks into **Baldur's Gate 3** and am still in Act 1 so I think my clever plan of trying to finish this before *Starfield* comes out is unlikely to come to fruition.
        - I mean, I can't even move on from **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War** yet because the epilogue siege battles are ending up harder than I thought!
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Same old regular constructed grinding still. Standard is bleah. Historic is plagued by the Ring and those Orcs. Wrote my [Lord of the Rings limited recap](/2023/08/mtgltr-limited-recap/) in anticipation of the next set / rotation happening in a couple of weeks.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Saving up spotlight caches.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Been a bit unmotivated to keep playing this one, as I'm not doing very well and am unsure how to improve. Kinda tempted to switch over to Strive for a while. Or maybe consider playing Modern controls lol.

- **Reading**: Reading has kind of taken a backseat this past week. Still reading: *Saving Time* by Jenny Odell. I have finished the West Coast Avengers v1 run! (Or at least what was available on Marvel Unlimited.) Might try to write a [complete-marvel-run][/tags/complete-marvel-run/] post this week. Feed reader backlog is currently at a very healthy 11 items.

- **Watching**: Watched [Heart of Stone](/2023/08/heart-of-stone-2023/) this week, upon my mom's recommendation. Also watching a bunch of TV stuff, but nothing too important.

### Walking

For most of this week, I was happily able to use my replacement Fitbit as normal to track my steps and my walking, but Saturday morning I started encountering issues with the tracker's battery (my bad luck continues), so Saturday did not get a complete set of walking. I ended the week with a total of 65,397 steps logged and 24,407 calories burned.

I'm still trying to see what I can do about it, but it seems like I encountered a known issue with the Fitbit Charge 2 where the battery is unable to hold a charge, possibly due to a firmware update. Will try to talk to Fitbit support and the Lazada seller I bought the unit from, but I am not optimistic about this whole thing.

### Some Links of Interest

I have a backlog of things to review and nothing to share this week.

Wait, okay, here's a trailer for an upcoming animated Scott Pilgrim show on Netflix:

### Things I've been thinking about

Being stupid, things breaking down, planned obsolescence, filling-in back-dated posts, the Disgaea series, walking in the noontime heat, the preconceptions people have when you're tall, even more side projects to start, open loops, teaching little kids to play games

### Things I'm looking forward to

- Ahsoka series starts this week on Disney+! I considered binging *Star Wars Rebels* before this drops but didn't have time, so we'll see how it works with watching Ahsoka first.
- Still hoping for that one! good week.
