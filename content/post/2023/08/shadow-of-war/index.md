Started playing this in late June because a friend was playing Shadow of Mordor and I was a bit envious, so I figured I would play the sequel. I was also doing some other [LOTR](/2023/07/rop-lotr/) [stuff](/2023/07/geekfight-fandom/) at the time, so there was some kind of synergy bonus. 

I [finished Shadow of Mordor back in 2014](/2014/11/528700287406469120/), but I barely remember any of it. So I had to relearn a lot of the combat stuff and asked for a plot summary from a friend who finished it recently. I tried playing Shadow of War back when it came out for PS+ a couple of years ago but never got too into it.

My friend calls this style of games "Assassin's Creed-likes", but I never played that series so my point of comparison is always the Batman *Arkham* series of games since that's what feels most similar to me, especially combat-wise. That being said, I was a bit annoyed at combat in Shadow of War especially at the start because it feels like you have so many meters / numbers to keep track off: in addition to your HP you have hitstreak (mostly does nothing), might (lets you do executions and some other stuff), wrath (lets you do some stronger abilities), and focus (lets you bullet-time your arrow shots). Oh, and number of arrow shots lol. And then your controls can change mid-combat if you mount a beast or other such conditions. It just feels overly complicated and I would be totally lost if there weren't input prompts telling me when I could do things. Up to now I still don't know when I can trigger Ice Storm! Still, the combat felt a bit more forgiving than the the Arkham games (certainly the counter window is much looser!) so I didn't have too much trouble.

The much-acclaimed Nemesis system is back of course, so you'll be facing a ton of different orcs and even recruiting them and conquering fortresses and having your orcs defend them and such. I'm actually not sure if there is any RNG involved in the generating the enemy orc captains, there are so many of them and with so much variations and they're all voiced with enough distinct voices that it doesn't feel repetitive. Also, the background orcs can chant the orc captain names, so that's a lot of voice work! Maybe they just pre-generated an extremely large pool of possible Orc captains?

I thought I could finish this game in a month or so before Baldur's Gate 3 came out, but it turns out there is simply a lot to do in this game. There's a main quest line, several side quest lines, collectibles, outposts to disable, challenge missions (thankfully completion DID not require me to get Gold rating on these!), and of course achievements. I actually only finished the main story epilogue last week; the last part was kind of grindy. Then a couple of days was enough to wrap up any missing achievements.

The Game Pass stats have my playtime at 46h, but the in-game playtime counter is only at 31h; IDK why there's such a large discrepancy. I did have to force-quit the game a few times (to avoid it autosaving some bad deaths lol), but that shouldn't account for such a large difference. The gamerscore is only at 1000/1500 because there's a bunch of DLC achievements I have no intention of getting into.

This game was much derided at launch because it had a very greedy microtransactions model, but all of that has been largely patched out of the game. Overall the game was reasonably fun, though some parts can be a slog and it's understandable if it's not for you.
