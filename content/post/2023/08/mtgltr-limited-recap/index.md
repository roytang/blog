Notes:

- I purposely didn't play a lot of this format because it's a nonstandard set so I wanted to save up my resources for the upcoming Wilds of Eldraine set. 
- I don't really have any insights. I did enjoy the WG halfling food deck, but it seems a bit challenging to put together consistently.
- Expectedly, my win-loss records were terrible because I played so few games and never really got into the format. At least I was able to sample all the colors.
