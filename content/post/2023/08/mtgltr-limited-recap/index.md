### Limited Notes

- I purposely didn't play a lot of this format because it's a nonstandard set so I wanted to save up my resources for the upcoming Wilds of Eldraine set. 
- I don't really have any insights. I did enjoy the WG halfling food deck, but it seems a bit challenging to put together consistently.
- Expectedly, my win-loss records were terrible because I played so few games and never really got into the format. At least I was able to sample all the colors.

### Magic Arena Stats

<p>Almost forgot to log the <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/mtgarenastats" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mtgarenastats</span></a> email for <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/MTGLTR" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>MTGLTR</span></a> that I got a couple of days ago. This was a very low-yield set for me especially in terms of boosters opened since I did not play much limited for this season. Hopefully we do much better with Wilds of Eldraine!</p><p><a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/mtg" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>mtg</span></a> <a href="https://indieweb.social/tags/magicarena" class="mention hashtag" rel="tag">#<span>magicarena</span></a></p>
