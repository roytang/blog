A while back, someone on Reddit posted [a list of their fast food spending since April 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/15n0t6a/sharing_my_fast_food_expenses_since_april_2016_do/). Since I love gathering stats, I have been meaning to do something similar since I started consistently tracking all my expenses in 2017. This reddit post finally spurred me to gather these stats!

Since this is a set of stats I can just keep updating on a yearly basis, I went ahead and added [a "Food" subpage to the stats section](/page/stats/food/).

Notes:

- Franchise choices are kind of arbitrary, mostly as I remember them; some of these aren't even "fast food"! It's entirely possible I forgot some and will have to update the data set later. It doesn't include any restaurants that I very rarely go to.
- I had to do a bit of data cleaning to make sure the data is fairly accurate, because I hadn't always logged the same thing consistently. Also because of stuff like `chili pepper luncheon meat` matching a query for `pepper lunch`.
- Unsurprisingly, Jollibee is always #1 in terms of spend and cost, simply because it's the nearest fast food to our place and I love Jolly Spaghetti and Jolly Hotdog.
- There is a lot of pizza.
- My overall total spend is actually much less than the one in the quoted reddit post; this is understandable since I started tracking my expenses when I was no longer working in an office full-time, which meant majority of my meals were taken at home. Also I am a generally frugal person anyway.
- There are more notes on the stats page itself.
