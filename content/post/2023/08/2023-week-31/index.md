title: 2023 Week 31
---

It is the first week of August already; time inexorably marches on. The rainy weather continued until about midweek and had mostly settled down by the weekend, though thankfully our days have not yet reverted to unreasonable heat.

### My Week

{{% photos luigi %}}

Last week was a bit challenging for me. The family got some bad news early in the week, which probably means more medical errands down the line. Around midweek, I think the outrage at [being the victim of petty theft](/2023/07/stolen-phone/) finally got to me and I spent the next few days oscillating between being unreasonably angry and/or moody, sometimes fantasizing about somehow tracking down the perpetrator myself. This was only exacerbated by some annoyance at the red tape and procedures I got trying to report some fraudulent transactions resulting from that incident. And throughout the week I had a few minor inconveniences like some investments not doing so well, accidentally overpaying for something, doing poorly in online games, or some hardware starting to fall apart; it basically felt like the universe was conspiring against me.

I did write about some of the steps I took (or should have taken): [What To Do When Your Phone Is Stolen](http://localhost:8000/2023/08/what-do-phone-stolen/). I might write a follow-up post regarding the annoyances from this past week though.

Despite being a bit down in spirit, the week was not very busy and at least I was able to resume work on some side projects and actually got some cleaning done even.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - I gave in to temptation and have purchased **Baldur's Gate 3** and started playing as soon as it was officially released. As I often do, I started out with a Paladin.
        - Still playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**, but I pushed it a bit before the BG3 release and am currently at 80% completion. Will try to finish it still despite BG3 calling my attention.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Same old regular constructed grinding still. There were a bunch of MTG-related announcements out of GenCon this weekend, so there's a lot to look forward to; hopefully I do well in the upcoming seasons.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Getting to infinite this season is a struggle; I've been at 87-93 for maybe a week now.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Doing very poorly online actually. I still have so much trouble with the general flow and pacing of SF6 matches compared to SF5. Might need to watch some videos/replays/etc

- **Reading**: Started reading: *Saving Time* by Jenny Odell. Decided to read through the West Coast Avengers run before writing the next [complete-marvel-run](/tags/complete-marvel-run) post, am about halfway through it already. Feed reader backlog is at a manageable 29 items.

- **Watching**: Nothing of significance this past week. Well, I was glad to find that there was a new season of *Futurama*, once again resurrected from the dead.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 68,094 steps and burned 26,299 cals. This is below my weekly target, but on Thursday morning I accidentally went out for a morning walk without my Fitbit on and so there's a bit more 2k untracked steps due to that error so I'm still going to count this one as good.

### Things I've been thinking about

Anxiety, a lack of energy, optimism, so many things to buy, predatory models, unreasonable anger, vengeance, being bad at letting things go, family, how often I mention "anxiety" in this space.

### Things I'm looking forward to

- The 45th is coming up; will post about it on Wednesday.
- We also have a quiz night on Wednesday!
- "Wednesday" can be so counterintuitive to spell.
- Once again, I could use a good week.
