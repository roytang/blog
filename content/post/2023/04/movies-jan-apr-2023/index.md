#### Good Will Hunting (1997)

<time id="letterboxd-review-337410751">[2023-01-10 18:46] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/1/6/2/1/51621-good-will-hunting-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=acb4766abd" /></p> <p>I haven't seen this before, but that scene where Will is at a bar taking down some guy talking about economics? I've seen it on the internet so many times, I figured I should go watch the film already.</p><p>This film came out in 1997 when I was in maybe the 2nd year of college and I feel like back then I would not have appreciated the themes of talent, ambition, fear and regret that encompass Will's journey in this film.</p><p>I can see why it's regarded as a modern-day classic. The film alternates between light-hearted moments and gut-wrenching conflict. The script is excellent (Best Original Screenplay Oscar was well-deserved!) and Williams and Damon gave really good performances. I am not sure if Damon or Affleck have ever been in films this good since then.</p><p>Disappointed at no title drop. I wanted Sean to say at some point "That's good, Will Hunting."</p>

#### The Pale Blue Eye (2022)

<time id="letterboxd-review-338827558">[2023-01-13 20:25] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/1/8/2/4/1/718241-the-pale-blue-eye-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=0ab02a8fe8" /></p> <p>Didn't know what to expect but was pleasantly surprised. I thought it was going to be a straightforward, if slightly creepy, murder mystery set in the 1830s, but the last 20 minutes or so really blew me away. Excellent tone and atmosphere as well, really fits the events of the film. Some scenes seemed unnecessarily too dark though.</p><p>Christian Bale gave a good performance as usual, but Harry Melling was just excellent as Edgar Allan Poe. Also, I was surprised to learn only upon reading the credits that Gillian Anderson and Robert Duvall were in the film, I did not recognize them at all!</p>

#### Batman and Superman: Battle of the Super Sons (2022)

<time id="letterboxd-review-339378547">[2023-01-14 23:44] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/7/9/7/4/9/3/797493-batman-and-superman-battle-of-the-super-sons-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=48ca022b10" /></p> <p>I like this new CGI animation style, everything looks cool. The plot is pretty by the numbers for a DC thing, but the banter between the boys is great.</p>

---

#### The Menu (2022)

<time id="the-menu-2022">[2023-01-28 21:36] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/1/3/2/3/521323-the-menu-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=d00a0d03a8" /></p> <p>This was very, very good. I wasn't sure what to expect; I thought it was going to be some stabby serial-killer thing, but the whole black comedy vibe and the rising tension were executed very well. Ralph Fiennes gives an excellent performance as the chef delivering the menu.</p>

#### Training Day (2001)

<time id="training-day-2001">[2023-02-01 00:30] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/5/8/0/50580-training-day-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=5ce5342625" /></p> <p>An intense film, and summarizes neatly why I find it hard to trust law enforcement and any so-called "war on drugs"</p>

#### Daredevil (2003)

<time id="daredevil-2003">[2023-02-05 13:53] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/rn/s7/bx/s3/dNVEqwgIdrwWQL3zXI5mQG60oM5-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=695539a398" /></p> <p>Starting on my backlog of poorly-reviewed comic book movies</p><p>This one I think tried to cram in way too many elements of the Daredevil mythos into one film. Trying to do Elektra, Kingpin and Bullseye all in one go was maybe a bit too ambitious. It led to them cutting back on actually developing each character properly. No mention of Stick or the Hand anywhere, we are just supposed to believe that Matt gained his fighting skills just by training a lot as by himself a kid. And Matt is super cavalier with not hiding his extra senses! He randomly tries to pick up Elektra at a coffee shop because she smells good, no backstory there. Also, in his first action sequence as Daredevil, he flat out murders a perp! WTH</p><p>I did enjoy a few of the action sequences, especially with Colin Farell's over-the-top Bullseye. Ellen Pompeo makes a short appearance as Karen Page! The soundtrack is pretty good too.</p>

#### Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007)

<time id="fantastic-four-rise-of-the-silver-surfer-2007">[2023-02-07 01:01] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/0/6/3/1/50631-fantastic-four-rise-of-the-silver-surfer-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=2affd85087" /></p> <p>I was not happy with the original so I never bothered watching this one, but it wasn't too bad actually, maybe a slight improvement over the original even, though that's not a high bar to clear. </p><p>Still not happy with Doom's BS powers coming back into play (and they didn't even bother explaining why he's still around lol). I understand space cloud Galactus was kind of silly, but I would imagine a gigantic guy in a hat would not have played well in theaters in 2007. </p><p>Was nice to see Chris Evans being brash and annoying instead of the do-gooder Steve Rogers. Also, there is way more physical comedy with Reed's abilities than I thought there would be. Also I thought the surfer's voice acting was pretty good.</p>

#### Lost Bullet (2020)

<time id="lost-bullet-2020">[2023-02-13 00:34] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/2/9/9/3/4/629934-lost-bullet-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=95be815c8c" /></p> <p>I think I got a recommendation for Lost Bullet 2 from somewhere and decided to watch this one first since it was also on NF. Didn't know anything coming in other than it's some kind of Fast and the Furious-type thing, and I've never seen any of those films. Surprised to find out it's actually a French film. Switched to French voices with English subs because the English dubs in live action really throws me off. </p><p>The plot isn't that original and kinda predictable and there were actually not as many car chases than I thought there would be, but it's a decent 90-minute popcorn film</p>

---

#### Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)

<time id="ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-2023">[2023-02-19 08:29] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/6/2/3/7/566237-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=27ced3fac4" /></p> 

Watched this yesterday. Spoiler-free review:

I enjoyed the film, but that might be because I'm a comics fan anyway and I don't care too much about CGI detail (a lot of people seem hung up on that). I liked the humor and the references, I liked the bad guy's costume design, was pleasantly surprised by some actors' being there and was honestly a bit giddy when a certain acronym was first mentioned.

That being said, I can understand all the complaints about the film. Character development is definitely not great and some of the returning cast don't have a lot to do. The ending is kind of a big missed opportunity and the first post-credits scene felt really silly. (Second post-credits scene will mean nothing to anyone who hasn't seen a particular TV series!) My brother (who I watched with) complained that the bad guy's background / origin story should have been more fleshed out. Apparently the writer for this film once wrote for Rick and Morty and that influence is certainly felt, which a lot of people might not enjoy.

I watched in IMAX and it was fine, though probably not necessary. Though I did enjoy seeing the Guardians 3 trailer in IMAX.

The plot felt very Star Wars. In fact, there's a specific scene in the third act that reminds me of a specific scene in the third act of Rise of Skywalker.

-0.5 stars for not having Luis, even as a cameo. My favorite performance here is by Michael Douglas, whose Hank Pym seems to be having the least stressful time in all 3 movies.

#### Nightcrawler (2014)

<time id="nightcrawler-2014">[2023-03-04 00:51] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/g7/2e/vi/vy/A9ANrAWlmIovxzjAIiOgseSLNc9-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6bcb14c88c" /></p> <p>I was a bit bored at the start, but the last 30-45 hours of this film are super intense. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a great performance as the freelance crime reporter who easily descends into darkness as his ambitions overshadow whatever morals he had. A stinging critique of capitalism and our attention economy as well.</p>

---

#### My Cousin Vinny (1992)

<time id="my-cousin-vinny-1992">[2023-03-16 00:17] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/2/8/8/46288-my-cousin-vinny-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=8444588281" /></p> <p>Watched this one because I recently read about how Marisa Tomei's oscar win was a bit controversial because she was a newcomer. I really enjoyed the film and the way it set up expectations for Vinny's courtroom smackdown in the third act. Not sure if Oscar-worthy, but both Tomei and Pesci gave good performances, especially with Mona Lisa on the stand. Thoroughly enjoyable!</p>

#### Shazam! Fury of the Gods (2023)

<time id="shazam-fury-of-the-gods-2023">[2023-03-18 21:59] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/2/2/4/0/5/522405-shazam-fury-of-the-gods-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6f53eef30f" /></p> <p>A fun little superhero movie, kinda predictable. Gave me some Thor the Dark World vibes for some reason.</p>

---

#### Suzume (2022)

<time id="suzume-2022">[2023-03-25 20:33] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/2/2/2/8/1/822281-suzume-locking-up-the-doors-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=106fe64e9b" /></p> <p>Some friends wanted to watch this in the cinema so I went with them. I hadn't seen a lot of Makoto Shinkai before. I've seen 5cms/second and know a bit about Your name by reputation, so I was expecting something similar to either of those, which I am willing to sit through, but not really the sort of thing I'm super into.</p><p>My expectations were broken. I ended up greatly enjoying this film. It had a lot more action than I expected, the animation was fantastic, and the script and plot were very clever and had the sort of timey-wimey shenanigans I always enjoy. </p><p>Lol that chair!</p>

#### John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)

<time id="john-wick-chapter-4-2023">[2023-03-27 20:36] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/3/0/8/8/2/530882-john-wick-chapter-4-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=bc32219057" /></p> <p>My friends asked me how this movie was and I was like "It meets expectations. You kind of imagine what a new John Wick movie would be like, and this is exactly that." Great action sequences as usual. One of the characters I had no idea why he was in the script at all, didn't seem like he added anything of interest.</p><p>While I did enjoy the film, I do think the whole John Wick saga went on a bit too long, and each additional entry, while entertaining, will just never have as much bang as the previous entries, so I'm glad this film concluded the way it did.</p>

---

#### Thor (2011)

<time id="thor-2011">[2023-04-06 23:43] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/4/5/6/46456-thor-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=36c210ad0d" /></p> <p>First time rewatching this in a long while, mostly because I've been reading the old Thor comics and couldn't remember what the Warriors Three looked like in the MCU. Volstagg is nowhere near as voluminous as he was in the comics!</p><p>I think the film holds up reasonably well, though it's nowhere as good as say, Iron Man. Does a reasonable job of introducing the Asgard mythos and the Asgard set pieces still look pretty good.</p>

---

#### Moneyball (2011)

<time id="moneyball-2011">[2023-04-06 23:47] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/h1/fd/pz/pi/3oAa8mJJ97CH9AeGEY6vjAxqcvZ-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=3ce471493f" /></p> <p>My mom said she tried to watch some Brad Pitt film about sports but found it boring because there was so much talking. I realized later that she was referring to this film and decided to finally watch it.</p><p>It's pretty good! It's a film about sports, but not really a sports film. And also a film about trying out new things and challenging industry preconceptions. The pacing and shots and how the pivotal moments in the team's season are portrayed are all well-executed.</p><p>Definitely the sort of film for my mom though.</p>

---

#### Murder Mystery 2 (2023)

<time id="murder-mystery-2-2023">[2023-04-08 11:38] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/6/4/9/9/6/564996-murder-mystery-2-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=08117aff8f" /></p> <p>Needed a light film to watch in the background, settled on this one from NF recommendations. I have almost no memory of what happened in the first film.</p><p>Sandler and Aniston's characters are now bumbling amateur detectives who rapidly stumble into happening to solve a kidnapping (and several murders). The humor is about what you'd expect for this kind of movie.</p><p>It reminds me of Rush Hour 3 for some reason, but that might just be because they also went to Paris (and that is the only detail I remember from Rush Hour 3)</p><p>Film is entertaining enough as popcorn fare that you shouldn't think too much about.</p>

---

#### Extraction (2020)

<time id="extraction-2020">[2023-04-11 00:18] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/7/4/4/7/1/474471-extraction-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=4b684f8e41" /></p> <p>Wanted an action film to watch while doing other stuff, this was a pretty good choice. Was honestly a bit bored at the start but then they had this insanely long set of action sequences that look like they were all a single shot (I found out later that they weren't, but still pretty impressive) and I started paying attention.</p><p>The plot isn't much to speak about, but the action sequences are pretty good and Hemsworth gives a pretty decent performance actually. Not bad, will probably give the sequel a shot.</p>

---

#### Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)

<time id="dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-2023">[2023-04-13 20:47] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/2/4/0/0/3/424003-dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7c3c4fddf9" /></p> <p>This was so good. Fresh, fun and witty adventure, and so many references for those familiar with the source material. I liked the Paladin and the Druid, but all the characters are quite good and reasonably fleshed out and likeable and the performances are pretty good. This is what I wish MCU movies could be like since Endgame.</p>

#### Surrogates (2009)

<time id="surrogates-2009">[2023-04-16 17:52] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/3/9/3/2/6/39326-surrogates-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=d3670a65a2" /></p> <p>I remember seeing the trailer for this one back in the day and thought it might be interesting. I was wrong. There was one decent action sequence in there but the rest of the film was forgettable.</p><p>I also have trouble with the idea that the use of surrogates is so widespread that homicides are unheard of, yet there are these large anti-surrogate reservations right next to the big cities where the residents all look like homeless people. Also surely only middle class and up are able to afford surrogates, so does the rest of society just live in these dread places?</p>

#### The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)

<time id="the-super-mario-bros-movie-2023">[2023-04-22 14:33] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/3/2/3/0/2/432302-the-super-mario-bros-movie-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=fea7ccddda" /></p> <p>Pretty good as far as video game adaptations go. The plot of the film is definitely for kids, but that can't be avoided as the source material isn't exactly deep. A fun romp with lots of references for fans of the Mario franchise in general. Huge improvement over the last film!</p><p>+ performances by Jack Black and Seth Rogen who were obviously having fun<br />+ Charles Martinet (original Mario voice) playing Mario's dad!!<br />+ Peach kicking ass<br />+ the existential Luma lol<br />- not explaining if their last name is Mario</p>
