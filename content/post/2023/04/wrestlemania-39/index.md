Watched Wrestlemania this year with the trivia team as usual. Took a few nights because as usual the event was way too long. 

I liked the following matches from best to worst:

- Charlotte Flair vs Rhea Ripley
- Owens/Zayn vs Usos
- Roman Reigns vs Cody Rhodes
- Edge vs Finn Balor
- Gunther vs McIntyre vs Sheamus
- Seth Rollins vs Logan Paul

Unmentioned matches were meh. Night 1 was overall better than night 2. 

Also, watching these events on Disney+ is always so weird because they go to the effort of hiding all the TurboTax ads.
