Played Arkham Horror LCG at a friend's house yesterday. It's a coop card game of solving mysteries based on the Cthulhu mythos.

We did two scenarios, the first one is *The Gathering* from the core game which was the intro, and the second one was *Curtain Call* from the Path to Carcosa. The two scenarios took us around 5hrs of playtime total I think, with a break in between for dinner. We made it through Curtain Call with only one person dying and being traumatized! We'll see if we have time to do another session of these and continue the campaign before the owner has to leave the country.
