title: Explorer Metagame Challenge
---

Did a few runs on the Explorer Metagame challenge on Arena with a couple of different decks:

Run 1: 2 wins (-500 gold +1 pack) Creativity
Run 2: 4 wins (+500 gold +5 packs) Rogues
Run 3: 2 wins (-500 gold +1 pack) Rogues
Run 4: 3 wins (+0 gold +3 packs) Rogues

So total record was 11 wins, 4 losses, -500 gold, +10 packs.

Explorer is a fun and varied format but wow I had forgotten how long BO3 games tend to play. Each of these runs took longer than a typical Premier Draft, even though I never went the distance. The decks I played were super grindy too, which definitely made things worse in that regard.

I also streamed the last couple of runs: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JqJk84YtnY
