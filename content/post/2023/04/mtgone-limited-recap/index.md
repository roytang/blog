### Limited Notes:

- After the disaster that was Brothers War limited, this set was much better for me and brings us back to an above average win rate, although still falling short of a good 60% win rate. I will get there someday!
- Once again, my win rates are dragged down by my disastrous performance during the Arena Open. Someday we will actually do well at one of those.
- I think the consensus best color for this limited format was red because of all the good cheap removal, though I don't think I got to play a lot of them.
- Adding the draft archetypes to the color pairs row, as an easy reference for if/when I end up playing this limited format again.
- The YT playlist linked below doesn't contain many of my drafts, since I did a good bunch of them offline.

### 7-x Drafts

### Arena Open

<time>[2023-03-05]</time> Sigh. Threw some gems away on the Arena Open again, attempts no. 2 and 3. First pool looked decent, but I had some bad misplays that cost me a couple of games, finished 2-3. Second pool had some good rares in shallow colors, I went RW for more consistency, but only went 1-3.

Someday we'll get there!

Also, I think I'll start compiling these into a table somewhere, so I can compare across sets etc
