title: 2023 Week 13
---

It's April! It has been a week. Donald Trump makes history (again) as [the first former US president to be indicted](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/03/30/politics/donald-trump-indictment/index.html). Elon [open sources the Twitter "algorithm"](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/03/twitter-posts-the-code-it-claims-determines-which-tweets-people-see-and-why/), promptly discovers there is an `is_elon` flag in there. 

### My Week

I came back from [four days in Singapore](/2023/03/sgtrip2023/).

Had to deal with some [webmention spam](/2023/04/webmention-spam/).

The rest of my week was spent catching up with errands and backlogs piled up over the four days I was gone, and trying to get back into my daily rhythms. Those rhythms are easily disrupted! Errands included bank stuff, buying meds, and various end-of-month responsibilities.

Trivia team [attended a quiz night last Thursday and CRUSHED IT](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-lastwoman)!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I finished **Return to Monkey Island** this past weekend! Still considering whether I will attempt completion before writing a review post, some of these achievements look quite tedious. I think I'm also close to finishing the **Witcher 3** main quest (about to head off to the Isle of Mists), after which I can play the DLCs that I haven't actually played yet.
    - Online: **Magic Arena** and **Eternal** daily grinding continuing, not much of note. Well, I did [finish Arena in Mythic this month](/2023/03/c570a3599955dc065f47de15cb5e9b1c/) after a long drought. I also got to my highest rank ever in **Marvel Snap**, thanks to playing it a lot during the trip. Still not infinite though.

- **Reading**: Still mostly just comics. Should start digging into an actual book again soon.

- **Watching**: Not a lot. Still working my way through S9 of *The Blacklist*. There are so many new series / seasons I want to watch though. (Last of Us, Picard, Mandalorian, etc etc)

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,402 steps and burned 27,827 calories. These are the highest weekly totals for the year so far, but both numbers are probably inaccurate. There was a stretch of walking around 2.5k steps where I didn't realize until too late that I wasn't wearing my Fitbit, so the step count is probably a bit higher. And for some reason, the calorie count actually increased during that period for some unknown reason, so the calories total is suspiciously high!

I used to be in "beat last week's totals" mode, but now that I'm past 70k steps per week I'm in more of a "just maintain this level of walking" mode.

### This coming week

Yesterday was Palm Sunday, which means of course the traditional Holy Week observances for the country are happening this week. Frankly I could use a chill week.
