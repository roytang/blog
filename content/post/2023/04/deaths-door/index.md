title: 'Games: Death''s Door'

This game wasn't on my radar at all and I only found it while browsing through the PC Game Pass listings. It was surprisingly good.

It's a nice little Zelda-like where you play a crow whose job is to reap the souls of the dead. The graphics style isn't too complicated but it works and there are some beautiful details in there. There is a decent amount of humor despite the grim storyline. The exploration gameplay is great; lots of places to explore and secrets to fight and items to find and areas unlocked by acquiring new tools. This sort of thing always sucks me in and this game is no different, I played for something like 9-10 hours over the first couple of days. Battles and boss fights are challenging, healing is limited, but at the same time they're not especially difficult or punishing and always manageable. There is no penalty for DEATH.

My total playtime clocks in at around 14h17m and I got 23/24 of the game's achievements. The missing achievement was for doing an entire run using only the umbrella, a weak weapon you can find early in the game, and that would take another entire run which would probably be an additional 4-5 hours at least and I'm not willing to do that. My one run ended up at 100% completion, so I am quite satisfied with the gameplay I got from this one. Except for that umbrella achievement, the rest are pretty easy, only a couple of others are missable.

Overall an excellent experience. A pleasant distraction!
