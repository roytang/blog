title: 'Books: Gideon the Ninth by Tamsyn Muir'

I recently found myself in long queue at a shop and [without my cellphone](/2023/07/stolen-phone/), so I managed to finish a book. **Gideon the Ninth** is the first of Tamsyn's Muir's *Locked Tomb* series of sci-fi/fantasy novels.

I think I got a copy of this book from the now-defunct Tor eBook of the month club, but just had it in my library for a while. I had no idea what it was about and I only saw and read that tagline of "Lesbian necromancers explore a haunted gothic palace in space!" when I took a screenshot of the cover for this post. *(If you're a bit of a prude, rest assured that while there is strongly implied same-sex attraction in the book, it is never really explicit.)* Finally decided to read it after I saw a friend post a while back that he was into it. 

The book takes place in a necromancy-powered spacefaring empire called *The Nine Houses*, with the First House referring to the immortal Emperor himself. The titular Gideon was raised an indentured servant to the Ninth House and she grew up around the current head Harrowhark Nonagesimus, and both of them absolutely hate each other. However, they are forced to cooperate when a summons from the Emperor requires each House to send delegates to become candidates to become Lyctors - powerful immortals who serve the Emperor directly. Circumstances require Gideon to pretend to be Harrow's bound cavalier despite how they feel about each other. They meet up with delegates from the other eight houses at the aforementioned "haunted gothic palace in space", and while things start out boring and civil, it all quickly devolves into a bloody and compelling locked-room murder mystery (with a large helping of necromancy).

Like all murder mysteries, the story suffers from the problem of having too many characters introduced at the same time once the delegates all meet; I always have trouble keeping an ensemble cast straight. This is solved quickly enough when people start dying off. The mystery part is pretty good with a number of misdirects as they explore the area and try to figure out what's going on and how the process of Lyctorhood actually happens. Things progress quickly and culminate in a very satisfying multi-chapter "final boss" melee encounter involving multiple combatants. That final encounter felt very *anime* as I was reading it and honestly I would love to see it actually animated instead of just jangling around in my imagination.

I was surprised that I enjoyed the book so much. My one complaint is that a number of the younger cast members including the titular Gideon speak with the cadence and mannerisms of modern teenagers and/or shitposters, which feels only slightly misplaced in the dark, gothic setting. Gideon herself serves some truly terrible jokes throughout the book, though this might not be surprising given how the author herself discusses the characters in the appendix. It's not a big downside, but I found it a bit jarring at the start.

Nevertheless, I find myself in the position of having enjoyed the book and being extremely satisfied with the ending, I am now compelled to immerse myself in yet another sci-fi series. The author is quite prolific; this book came out in 2019, and the fourth book is already due out later this year.
