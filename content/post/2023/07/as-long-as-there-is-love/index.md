> The grief of time passing, of life moving on half-finished, of empty spaces that were once bursting with the laughter and energy of people we loved. 
> 
> As long as there is love, there will be grief, because grief is love’s natural continuation. It shows up in the aisles of stores we once frequented, in the half-finished bottle of wine we pour out, in the whiff of cologne we get two years after they’ve been gone. 
> 
> Grief is a giant neon sign, protruding through everything, pointing everywhere, broadcasting loudly: “Love was here”. 
> 
> In the finer print, quietly, “Love still is”.

I am not grieving anything in particular, but this still hit like a gut punch.
