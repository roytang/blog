I had high hopes for *Secret Invasion* coming in, the first two episodes were fairly decent. By the end of the 3rd and 4th I was complaining that I had no idea where this was all going and no idea how they were going to deliver a satisfying conclusion in the last 2 episodes. In short, they didn't. The show was supposed to be all about Nick Fury, and while we do get some exposition about his background and what he's been up to since the 80s, his character arc in this show doesn't really go anywhere. The show was supposed to be all about the Skrulls and all their sleeper agents and their secret invasion, but there's hardly any mystery or intrigue after the first couple of episodes. Everything is so obvious and straightforward and the writing for the ending just seemed lazy and sloppy and rushed. Sigh. This does not give me high hopes for *The Marvels*. Maybe I'll just go re-read the comics *Secret Invasion*.
