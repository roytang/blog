**Tears of the Kingdom** is of course, the sequel to 2017's fantastic open-world Zelda installment *Breath of the Wild*. I [played and finished the original on WiiU](/2017/12/BdUzGKaAcpP/) and was very excited to play the sequel. I have not been disappointed.

TotK takes everything that BotW and just adds and expands more on basically everything in the game. The game uses what is seemingly the same map of Hyrule, but basically tripled in size: two new layers are added, the Sky and the Depths, and each layer is explored and plays differently compared to the surface. TotK retains that BotW quality of incredibly good draw distance such that when you're soaring high above hyrule it's easy to spot things of interest that may be so very far away. The game still looks great and I still love this cel-shaded art style, it looks fantastic to me.

Link's new abilities are much more interesting in comparison to his abilities from BotW (though I did miss infinite bombs a bit), and the most intruiging bit is the magnificent Ultrahand ability, which allows Link to combine different devices to construct all sorts of contraptions. If you spent any time hanging around [the #TearsOfTheKingdom hashtag on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TearsOfTheKingdom), you're going to see so many posts of the creative things players have built using this ability. (Unfortunately, I am not creative and just stick to building the most basic of things).

A lot of the core gameplay remains the same: explore, find shrines, fight baddies and bosses and very challenging Lynels, solve puzzles, help people, collect weapons and armor, etc etc. Except the game also adds so much more stuff to do. In BotW, the main distraction was collecting Korok seeds. Those are here too, but then you also have to collect gems from caves, find wells, help a weird guy put up signs everywhere, etc. When you look at the map it doesn't feel so big, but when you're walking around you realize just how large the area is and the game just feels massive and filled with so much stuff. The breakable items of BotW make their return, but are somehow even more annoying, because in-world most weapons are now "decayed" which means they break more easily, but Link's new Fuse ability let's you mitigate that by combining your weapon with materials or other weapons to improve power and durability. Still mildly annoying though!

I got into this way more than I did with BotW. I finished BotW with 109/120 shrines. For this one, I managed 152/152 shrines and 120/120 lightroots (basically shrines for the depths). I went ahead and finished the game when I got shrine completion, but I still left so much undone, and I am hoping to sneak in a few sessions of the game every so often to peck away at those missing things.

End game stats:

- 152/152 Shrines
- 120/120 Lightroots
- 165/1000 Korok Seeds (WTH, 1000?!?)
- 61% Map Completion 
- 57/60 Side Quests
- 82/139 Side Adventures
- 90/146 Bubbul Gems
- 32/58 Wells
- 63 Stone Talus remain undefeated
- 53 Hinox remain undefeated
- 2 Molduga remain undefeated
- 17 Flux Construct remain undefeated
- 11 Gleeok remain undefeated
- 34 Frox remain undefeated
- 57/92 Compendium Creatures
- 93/110 Compendium Monsters
- 88/126 Compendium Materials
- 92/175 Compendium Equipment
- 5/6 Compendium Treasure

Those are just the things the game gives me numbers for. There isn't even a way to count how many more Addisons I have to help!

I managed to stream this game a few times, including the actual shrine completion and the ending! [Here's a Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmZEoaks5DI&list=PLmU0vkKslGXj64cHD0ZHcozyX4vMPyry-).
