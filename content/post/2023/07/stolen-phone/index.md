title: My Phone Was Stolen
---

If I had a nickel for every time my phone has been stolen... well I'd have two nickels, but it's kinda sad it happened twice.

The last time was [way back in 2008](/2008/12/1067295016/), which was a completely different era where you didn't rely on your phone for things like 2FA, authenticators, OTP codes, online banking and such. So this time was much more complicated than the last time. I spent most of the past 24 hours reviewing what happened, checking and dealing with possibly compromised accounts, resetting passwords, interacting with customer support and generally being stressed out. It's been very educational and I plan to do a more detailed "What to do when your phone gets stolen" blog post maybe next week when everything has settled down.

As for the theft itself, there's not much to tell. I was in one of the nearby shopping malls on my way to a quiz night; I had crossed a bridge to another shopping mall that I needed to pass to get to the train station, but when I stopped to buy a donut, I could no longer find my phone. In near panic, I asked the lady handing me a donut if she could ring it for me, and the number could no longer be reached. I tried to backtrack my steps back to when I last remember using the phone, around 15 mins prior, but couldn't find anywhere where I could have misplaced it or left it or dropped it or whatever. No such luck.

I rushed home in a taxi so I could disable the phone remotely. In hindsight this might have been a mistake - I was already at the mall and probably should have immediately gone to the telco store to report the lost SIM - more on that in the future blog post. I later confirmed it was indeed stolen when I got alerts about some of my accounts being reset using a phone number. And online tracking even up to now still says the phone was last seen when and where I last remember having it.

In hindsight I have to hand it to the thief. I usually keep my phone in the front pocket of my sling bag, a pocket that's fairly tight and hard to access without alerting me. But I felt nothing and didn't bump into anyone or anything like that. I suspect he waited for an opportune moment when I put the phone back into the sling bag and was possibly distracted or careless and didn't close the pocket immediately and made his move.

Things are mostly resolved, I think, with minimal losses (other than the unit itself). I managed to get the old sim disconnected and the unit blacklisted (who knew you could do that) and if they ever connect it to the internet it should factory reset. Earlier today I was able to get a new sim, a day after the phone was taken (though I'm told it will take a few days to activate). Will write about all of these in more detail next week once I am sure I have a working phone again.
