I watched the first season of **The Blacklist** back in 2013. Back then it was just another episodic procedural albeit with an interesting premise: Master criminal Raymond "Red" Reddington, the so-called "Concierge of Crime", turns himself in to the FBI and proposes that he work as a Confidential Informant, delivering high-level criminals some of which the authorities had never even heard of. His one condition: to work with rookie FBI agent Elizabeth Keen, who has never heard of him before. The mystique of the show revolves around Red's mysterious interest in Liz Keen. Back then I only watched the first season and dropped it for being a bit boring.

Earlier this year I found that all the current seasons of the show were on Netflix, so I decided to binge them from season 2 onwards, an effort that took a few months. I'm always wary of shows that revolve around a mystery (in this case Red's relationship with Liz); because of the way network TV operates they have to try to keep the mystery going for as long as possible while still keeping the viewers hooked (I'm still not sure what happened to X-Files! [^1] As the series gets longer, they tend to pile on more and more mysteries and start to write themselves into a corner with so many details that can't possibly be resolved cleanly that the ending can't help but be a mess.

The Blacklist seemed to handle this a bit better than other shows of each kind. While Red's real relationship with Liz was always kept as an overarching mystery, each season had self-contained mysteries and running plots that are mostly resolved towards the season's end, although they will often peel back another layer that adds even more questions. It helps that many of the cases are genuinely interesting and well-written and Red himself (portrayed by the wonderful James Spader) always proves how cunning and resourceful he is regardless of what situations they get into.

All of that kind of started falling apart when Liz Keen's actress Megan Boone decided to quit the show after the 8th season. They had to write the season around Red's future plans for Liz which also fell by the wayside by the end of season 8. If you were to stop watching this show at this point, it would be totally acceptable to just consider the season eight finale as the (sad) ending for the show.

Yet the show managed to hobble along for another two seasons, even without Liz Keen, this time focused entirely on Red and his relationship with the FBI task force that handles him. Season nine had Red coming back to his activity after a short hiatus and dealing with betrayal from within his own organization. The final season started airing this year shortly after I finished the Netflix binge. I was hoping they would use the final season to further explore threads left unresolved from previous seasons and nicely wrap things up with a bow. Most of the season involved encounters with former Blacklisters and towards the end Red seemed to be dismantling his vast criminal empire himself, which I assumed meant he had a clever exit plan in mind and that was the conclusion this season was leading to.

The series finale aired earlier today, and to say I am disappointed is an understatement. No spoilers, but the show ended in what was a seemingly random and abrupt manner that seemed very uncharacteristic of Reddington. And for some reason set up conflicts with some recently introduced characters that didn't really go anywhere. Not even a hint of addressing past questions about the show's mysteries like Red's true identity or his relationship with Liz. Not even a rambling dialogue with Cooper or Ressler to shed light on why he had been doing what he was doing. No real closure for any of the cast of characters or for all the relationships they built up over the years. Even **The Flash** [had a better ending](/2023/06/rip-arrowverse/), and that was a way worse show!

I can understand why they went the direction that they did, but to do it with minimal build-up and without even remotely addressing the mythology the show had built up over the years was a terrible decision. It wasn't even necesssary to address the show's mysteries directly - the question of Red's identity really has only one real answer given everything we know about Red and Liz's history - but I would have liked something simple like Cooper or Ressler mentioning to Red that they figured it out themselves and they all come to an agreement that it doesn't need to be discussed further. While I think the show gave Red and Dembe decent endings to their character arcs, everyone else was kind of just left hanging (at least new Aram got to go home! (I didn't bother learning his name.))

Sigh. Overall the show was still worth watching; the last two seasons maybe less so. It really lost a lot story-wise with Megan Boone leaving, which shows it wasn't just Spader carrying the show alone. At least it's done!
