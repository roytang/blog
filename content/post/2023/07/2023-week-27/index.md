### The World

It was so hot last week that at least one of the local newspapers decided to run a weather report as their top headline:

{{% img src="20230707_121704.jpg" %}}

It continues to be hot, despite it supposedly being the rainy season already. Sometimes there is a hint of thunder or cloud cover, but it usually dissipates quickly. Apparently we are in some kind of "monsoon break", whatever that means.

Also, based on anecdotal stories, we are one of the few households that still buys print newspapers on a daily basis. Unsurprising.

Meta has launched their Twitter competitor Threads (hey, it's also in the newspaper front page!). I have minimal interest in Meta's new platform, except maybe for how much it's pissing off Elon Musk. They tied identity to your Instagram account, which is admittedly a clever way to bootstrap a large userbase. They have like ten billion users now or something, and Elon Musk has threatened to sue Meta for... hiring all the Twitter employees he fired? Something like that.

### My Week

This week was busy and honestly a bit exhausting for me. A lot of going out, medical errands, that kind of thing. Not a lot I can talk about.

[GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) is this weekend; I had been planning to join, but it's just been a bit too busy this week and I didn't have the energy for it when the weekend rolled around.

We did two quiz nights this week! [Geekfight](/2023/07/geekfight-fandom/) and [PopQuiz](/2023/07/popquiz-90s/), though sadly we failed to win either of them.

### Previously

Around this time last year, [I was in Bicol](/2022/07/five-days-in-naga/). Around this time four years ago, [I was in the US](/tags/ustrip2019/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - I have finished **Tears of the Kingdom**! My review is [here](/2023/07/totk/).
        - Still playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**; now that TotK is done, I might try to power through this one before starting something new.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena!**: Just regular constructed grinding. It's going to be a bit boring until the next set comes out.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Looking forward to the patch this week that changes card acquisition, been holding off on getting my upgrades until it comes out.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week still.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: still going through the characters one at a time, alternating with playing World Tour.

- **Reading**: Not much progress because of all the busyness this week. Feed reader backlog is at a healthy 34 items.

- **Watching**: Finished watching Rings of Power and also did a rewatch of the LOTR trilogy. Short reviews [here](/2023/07/rop-lotr/).

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,501 steps and burned 25,266 cals. Happy to get there despite the hot weather making it a horrible experience to walk anytime after 6am and before 6pm. Wednesday and Thursday went way over target because I had gone out for the quiz nights and decided to walk around a lot.

### This coming week

- We might watch new Mission Impossible later this week. Kind of tempted by new Indiana Jones as well, but going to the cinema is expensive so I will wait for it on streaming probably.
- Oh, and the Blacklist *series finale* is out this week I believe!
