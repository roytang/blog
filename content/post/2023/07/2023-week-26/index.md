title: 2023 Week 26 This Too Shall Pass
---

Amazingly, we somehow made it halfway through 2023. Time continues to flow faster than I'd like.

### The World

Twitter continues to be terrible. This weekend, they started denying access to non-logged in users and also started rate-limiting how many tweets you can read per day, which is ridiculous for a social media platform. Some people speculate it's because Elon stopped paying for their Google Cloud infra, but apparently [that relationship has been patched up](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/twitter-resumes-paying-google-cloud-patching-up-relationship).

### My Week

Since it's the end of month, I had the usual end-of-month errands to see to. Finance health checks, buying meds for the parents, and also accompanying one of them for some routine tests.

Wednesday was a holiday over here in the PH (Eid al-adha?). This meant some surprise visits from some of my nieces and nephews, and I spent more time this week babysitting than I expected. I'm not complaining, I love spending time with them!

Since it's halfway into the year, I also did one of my regular backup routines. I usually export and backup a lot of stuff, including photos, journals, chat logs, that kind of thing. Aside from the copies local to my main PC, I also back up to a couple of external HDs. This time, I found that my older external HD has started having errors and had to have Windows run error-checking on it overnight. It may be on it's way to failure soon. (Conventional wisdom says one should also have an off-site backup in addition to externals, but my stuff isn't THAT mission-critical!)

### This Too Shall Pass

My external drive starting to fail reminded me that despite my best efforts, nothing's going to last forever. I do all this backing up and archiving in the hope of preserving something for the future, but eventually I will die and all of this will vanish and fade away to nothing. With all the problems facing our digital platforms, not even the vestiges of our online presences are likely to last very long. This website will not last long after I am gone. Such is the nature of life. 

And yet, I can't help but think that ten or twenty years down the line, future me will appreciate having the records of these days to look back upon, the same way I look back on [my twenty years of blogging](/2022/08/twenty-years/) and other archives. (Though there are many things I wish I had been able to preserve that had since been lost to time!)

Twitter's continuing yet slow-moving collapse also refreshes my anxiety about the future of the web as an open platform. Aggressive AI scraping makes it much less feasibly economically to maintain large open platforms (I am not sure how long [the Internet Archive can manage to fend off the scrapers](https://thedesk.net/2023/05/internet-archive-outage-sunday-afternoon-brewster-kahle/)!), and the dearth of AI-generated content threatens to overwhelm the human-powered internet (see the links section below for more about this). I have no idea what form the open web will take in the future, but it's my hope that I continue to be able to have this space to write and post my thoughts.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Very close to finally finishing **Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**. I have less than 10 shrines remaining to find, and after that I will probably try to finish the main quest and hopefully write my review, maybe sometime this week? There's actually still so much left undone in the game, but I have to move on at some point!
        - Also been playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**, although just a little bit at a time. 
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena!**: Did some LOTR drafting this week (videos are up on the [Youtube channel](https://youtube.com/@roytang/)), but I didn't really do very well this time around. Decided to not draft too much of this set to save resources for the next standard-legal set coming in a few months.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. New season starts in a couple of days, hopefully the revamped card acquisition system makes the game better.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week still.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: still going through the characters one at a time. Also started World Tour already. Just used the default avatar model, because if I tried to customize it, decision paralysis means I'd never get anything done!

- **Reading**: About halfway through the current Discworld book. Still reading a bunch of old comics, though the pace has been a bit slow this week. 

- **Watching**: No new movies seen this week. Mostly catching up on recent TV. Finished the most recent seasons of the Simpsons and NCIS. Powering through Amazon's Rings of Power because we have a LOTR category in one of our quiz nights this week. Maybe watching some anime even.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,241 steps and burned 25,163 cals. Only around 6.5k on Saturday, but was up by 500-750k the rest of the week, so it averaged out. Happy to still be able to maintain this pace.

    > "While we debate about how much power AI will give or take away from us, there seems to be a widely held view that our future will be more and more automated. I just hope we realise somewhere along the way that human interaction – no matter how tedious it may feel in contrast to a perfectly optimised digital experience – is not just a prerequisite for a functioning society but a life worth living."
