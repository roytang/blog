title: Rings of Power + LOTR trilogy rewatch
---

### Rings of Power

We had a Lord of the Rings category for [one of our quiz nights this week](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-fandom), so as a bit of prep I decided to finally watch **Rings of Power** on Prime Video. The first season was overall fine but definitely far too slow-paced in the first half, and gave me a better appreciation of the backstory of LOTR. Some of it doesn't match exactly with what we know from Tolkien's notes, but as an adaptation / interpretation, I think that's fine. The setting and the scenes and the shots and the CGI are pretty good, the only real problem is the pacing; very little of consequence happens during the first half of the 8-episode season. I think the first two episodes are dedicated entirely to setting up the status quo. I figure they could cut 1-2 episodes and it might still be fine. Still, I will probably be watching the second season.

### Lord of the Rings trilogy

I finished Rings of Power a bit early, so I had time to also do a rewatch of the original LOTR film trilogy from 2001-2003. These are still incredibly good and hold up extremely well. My only nitpick is that there is a lot of backstory that was never really explained on film, but that was understandable given how long the films are already; it would have been insane to try to fit even more of it in. I watched the versions on Prime Video, which I believe are the theatrical releases, so I missed out on some extended edition stuff.

One thing to note in 2023 is that these films spawned so many recognizable memes during the past decade, especially Fellowship! 

Some scenes of interest I noted:

- Everyone bickering at the Council of Rivendell and Frodo finally declaring he will take the Ring to Morder, and Gandalf's crestfallen expression when he realizes how much of a burden Frodo has elected to take on.
- The chase scene with the Balrog through the Mines of Moria; this was longer than I remembered, but I enjoyed how it was portrayed and of course Gandalf's classic standoff with the Balrog. I had forgotten how downcast the rest of the fellowship had been after believing Gandalf was dead, making their rest at Lothlorien right afterwards more meaningful.
- Frodo trying to leave Sam behind at the end of Fellowship and Sam would literally rather drown than give up on chasing after him, leaving Frodo no choice but to come back for him.
- THEY'RE TAKING THE HOBBITS TO ISENGARD!!!
- The White Wizard misdirect in Fangorn forest and the emotional reuniting with Gandalf. Frodo himself never gets to reunite with Gandalf until the end of ROTK, but this scene in Two Towers feels much more poignant because it is the first time we the audience see Gandalf return as well.
- Gandalf confronting Wormtongue at Edoras and waking Theoden from his stupor
- Two Towers has always been my favorite of this trilogy and that's because the defense of Helm's Deep remains my favorite battle sequence in the whole trilogy. Just a great desperate continuous defense from start to finish until Gandalf finally appears with the dawn when all hope is lost. The comparable battle is of course the Battle of Pelennor Field in ROTK, but that feels like it has much less emotional impact because (a) backup arrives twice (once when the armies of Rohan arrive, and second when Aragorn arrives with his spirit warriors); and (b) It does not serve as the climax of the film.
- Don't get me wrong, I loved ROTK as well. The showdown at the Black Gate was great as well, although I question the timing of the cuts between the Black Gate and Frodo and Sam trying to climb up the mountain because it feels like the armies of Men would have fallen long before the two Hobbits could get up that mountain!
- "My friends, you bow to no one." My favorite part of this ending, very emotionally charged.
- Edit: Also every scene where Andy Serkis portrays Gollum and Smeagol talking to each other seamlessly.
- I fully understand why the Scouring of the Shire did not make it into these films, it would have come off quite weird tonally and in terms of plot after the above.

That's it! I love this trilogy and movies and this will certainly not be the last time I rewatch them. 2023 is coincidentally the 20th year since the release of ROTK, so maybe rewatch again in 2023?

### Epilogue

Sadly, we did not do so well in the LOTR category [in the relevant quiz night](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-fandom) lol.
