### The World

More than a week ago, the screen actors guild chose to join the WGA on strike, so Hollywood is basically shut down. Coincidentally this weekend is San Diego Comic-Con; and the timing means most actors can't appear at SDCC to promote their films or shows. This is also release weekend for Barbie and Oppenheimer, I am probably not watching either. Maybe on streaming.

### My Week

The week was unexpectedly busy. Had some family medical issues that had to be attended to and I basically spent a day and a half of my weekdays accompanying the olds and hanging out in clinics and labs. The thing about those labs is that they always have terrible data signal so I have to make sure to prepare offline entertainment for when I know I'll be waiting around in those places for a while. 

[Wrote about government bureaucracy](/2023/07/bureaucracy/).

Trivia team [attended a quiz night last Wednesday](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-triskaidekaphilia).

Started working on some frontend/UI changes for the site and am committing them incrementally, so don't be surprised if something suddenly breaks for a while on the site.

For some reason I decided to start a new tumblr: [Grocery Logs](https://www.tumblr.com/grocerylogs).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Still playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**, but progress is slow. Tempted to preorder **Baldur's Gate 3** already.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena!**: Same old regular constructed grinding. 
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. I only got Iron Lad from this week's spotlight cache, but he's the one I wanted most so yay?
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Now that I'm done with everyone's placement matches, I'm working on finishing world tour so I can do avatar battles. Is that how it works? New DLC character Rashid is dropping tomorrow, I probably won't get him.

- **Reading**: Still reading **Gideon the Ninth**. Finished the Avengers v1 run! There's a bunch of other stuff I want to read before doing a [complete-marvel-run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run) blog post though. Also because I had to be waiting around in clinics and labs so much this week, I was able to binge-read the entire run of **Sakamoto Days**

- **Watching**: No new movies this week, I think I mostly just watched **Strange New Worlds**.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,493 steps and burned 25,515 cals. Happy to hit the 70k target again after missing last week.

### Some Links of Interest

A bit more than usual today, trying to clear out stuff from my notes backlog.

- [‘The Simpsons’ Is Good Again](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-simpsons-is-good-again.html): I am a longtime Simpsons fan, staying with the show even through the so-called "Dark Ages" and having recently finished season 34, I must agree with most of this article

### Bonus: SDCC stuff I'm looking forward to:

- (Youtube) [new Captain Marvel trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wS_qbDztgVY). There's a certain shot of Carol here where the CGI feels a bit iffy, but I am otherwise looking forward to this film
- (Youtube) [One Piece Netflix trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ades3pQbeh8). What's been shown so far has vastly exceeded my admittedly low expectations.
- (Youtube) [Invincible season 2 trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ED1SJ1TA2Do)

MTG also previewed some Doctor Who stuff, which makes me sad that most of the new Universes Beyond stuff is Commander-focused. New Mortal Kombat and new Tekken also look great, though I'm unlikely to play those. Marvel Comics announced a new Punisher, but it's still a white guy; I would have chosen a woman to kind of frustrate incels who identify with the concept of the Punisher.

### Things I've been thinking about

Mortality, anxiety, back pains, CSS, focus, energy, archiving, the open web, professional fees

### Things I'm looking forward to

- We have another quiz night later this week.
- *Secret Invasion* finale this week! I have no idea where this is going!
