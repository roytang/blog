My dad found a stack of old Reader's Digests while he was cleaning up some old boxes of his. They are relatively well-preserved!

We used to have a lot of these when I was young, I think my mom gave most of them away. We were subscribed for a long time. I estimate from around the mid-90s to the early 2010s; the ones in the image above are from 2010-2013. 

My mom mentioned that in hindsight the subscription might not have been worth it but I disagree. I got a lot of mileage out of those regular Reader's Digest issues fueling my voracious appetite for reading. I remember we often had well-worn Reader's Digests sitting in the bathrooms as light reading.

We were reading these before the internet and cellphones exploded in popularity; browsing the new Reader's Digest for articles of interest was a bit like the pre-internet equivalent of scrolling through your social media feeds hoping to find something interesting and funny. At the very least I always looked forward to the Word Power and Laughter is the Best Medicine sections. The feature articles and stories could be hit or miss (the consequences of a variety magazine covering a wide gamut of topics), but I usually found at least one or two that piqued my interest. Also, I remember using one of the stories for a Comm class assignment back in college.

I'm actually surprised the magazine is still around. Well, I'm surprised any magazine is still around given the internet. I guess the fact that these 2010's ones are in relatively good conditions meant we didn't read them that much either (or my dad stored them away early?). (Although [I was definitely still reading them in 2012](/2012/05/207491468259110912/)!)

The contact pages here mention that they pay out in USD for joke or story submissions. I remember wanting to send one in back when I was still in college; I think at the time the going rate was something like $150 for a feature-length story, which seemed like a lot of money to a poor college student in this country. Sadly, I never found a good submission to send in.

My dad wanted to toss these out, but I volunteered to keep them instead. I'm not sure what to do with them, though I'll probably skim each one at some point. I did check archive.org to see if they had Reader's Digests in their collection. The ones there mostly seem to be older issues and the US edition. These are marked as "English language Asian edition", but IDK how different that would be from the US edition. The [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reader's_Digest#International_editions) also doesn't list such an edition. Still, it might be worth scanning them and uploading to the archive although (a) that's a bunch of work; and (b) I don't know the implications of that legally. Hopefully I figure out what to do with them before I need to write a "10 years later" post. In the meantime, I shall probably just store them somewhere like my dad did.
