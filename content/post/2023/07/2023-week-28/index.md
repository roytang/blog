title: 2023 Week 28

One thing about changing the weeknotes title format to use the week# is I'm always worried I will misnumber the weeks. Hasn't happened yet (I think)!

### The World

The recent heat wave continued to the middle of the week, and on Thursday it was like somebody flipped a switch and boom, three days of near-constant rain, causing flooding and traffic in many places throughout the metro (and making my daily walks more challenging).

### My Week

It was a less busy week for me, less errands etc. So I wanted to try to catch up on some side projects and other stuff I've fallen behind on a bit. Then the middle of the week hit us with a double whammy. On Wednesday we had a power outage that we were told would last until mid-afternoon, and this was still during the heat wave so we were quite hot at home and ended up going to the mall to escape. On Thursday just after midnight [our internet service stopped working](/2023/07/110703324373892329/). Luckily twitter was still functional enough for me to figure out that it was an area-wide thing and not an "our house" thing as it sometimes is; all I could do was submit a report and wait for things to be resolved. The outage lasted a bit more than 24h. At least I managed to get some offline stuff done and even managed to clean up some of the junk in my room.

I wrote [about poetry](/2023/07/as-long-as-there-is-love/) and [about Reader's Digests](/2023/07/readers-digest/) for some reason.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Still playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**; the game tells me I am 35% through, though I am not sure if I will be motivated enough to 100% this.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena!**: Same old regular constructed grinding. Thinking about writing my Lord of the Rings limited stats post already since I don't plan to draft the set anymore, though maybe I'll wait for the Arena stats email.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. I completed the first week of Spotlight caches!
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week still. The game feels like it's in maintenance mode already, even though there is no official word and they are still releasing a new card and a new story every week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Still playing a bunch of World Tour. For online matches, I finished placement matches for everyone! The best 3 fighters were Ryu (Platinum), Zangief (Gold) and surprisingly Blanka (Gold), the rest were either Silver or Bronze.

- **Reading**: Finished reading [Moving Pictures by Terry Pratchett](/2023/07/moving-pictures/). Reading the Avengers v1 run is close to the end! Started reading **Gideon the Ninth**

- **Watching**: Since we went out to the mall Wednesday, we went ahead and watched the newly-released **Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning Part 1**, my [review is here](/2023/07/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-2023/). This week was also the series finale of **The Blacklist**, which got an undeserved terrible ending; I [wrote a series review here](/2023/07/the-blacklist/). Also started watching season 2 of **Star Trek: Strange New Worlds** which has been great so far, I am looking forward to writing about it.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 63,067 steps and burned 23,970 cals. We have broken the 70k weekly step target for the 2nd time since March, though this is much worse than the first time. The rains in the second half of the week made hitting the targets very challenging. I can go out walking with an umbrella of course, but it's much more challenging and I'd typically come back with my shoes and socks drenched which I hate. Not sure if we can compensate enough in the coming weeks to maintain the average, as it looks like it will still be rainy. Still, we are doing about twice as many steps in a week compared to the same time last year, so it's still a big improvement. Besides it's probably better than the stifling heat we had for the ten days prior.

### Some Links of Interest

For a while now I've had some links saved to Twitter threads I found interesting but haven't been sure how to share them, as I'm not sure Twitter links are going to be in any way useful or reliable in the near future. I finally settled upon looking for an unroll by [@threadreaderapp](https://twitter.com/threadreaderapp) and getting an archive.org link for it, so I can share some this week.

### Things I've been thinking about

Lack of focus, the 45th coming up in August, upcoming stuff, writing VS Code extensions, doing the site redesign, citizen participation in governance, advice I'd give to my tounger self, living in the moment, things falling apart and coming back together.

### Things I'm looking forward to

- We are attending another quiz night this week, this time at a new venue.
- So many new game releases to look forward to in the coming months, all of them not in [my 2023 gaming plans](/2023/01/2023-checklist/#games):
    - August: Baldur's Gate 3 (Steam)
    - September: Starfield (PC game pass)
    - October: Super Mario Bros Wonder (Switch)
    - November: Persona 5 Tactics (PC game pass)
    - *(I;m glad two of these are on game pass and so won't challenge my budget too much, though the new Mario game is the one I'm most looking forward to! I'm kind of glad I don't have a PS5 or there'd be 2-3 other items up there.)*
