title: State of the Nation 2023
---

President Marcos Jr delivered his second State of the Nation Address today after one year in office. I thought I'd start a tradition of writing my own mini "State of the Nation" blog post on the same day the president does. Not as a response or anything like that. More like my own observances and anecdates and how I personally feel about the state of our beleaguered nation. This may or may not be a good idea.

### The Current Admin

This is not a response to Marcos Jr's SONA because I didn't really listen to it. I did not care to. I did sit down through a news report summarizing the SONA and it seems like I didn't miss much. Even now after watching the report I'm not sure what are the accomplishments, if any, of the current administration. But I did watch the news segment alongside our helper ("Ate"), and her few responses were worth quoting:

> *News segment mentions something about economic growth*
>
> Ate: Lahat naman ng presyo tumataas *(All the prices are going up)*
>
> *News segment quotes Marcos supporters saying he has the most accomplishments*
>
> Me: So ano nga ba mga nagawa nya? *(So what did he actually accomplish?)*
>
> Ate: Yung mga byahe! *(All his travels!)*

### Politics

I kind of mostly disengaged from PH politics after the 2022 elections because I found all of it disheartening. Not just because my preferred candidate lost, though that is a big part of it of course. In my lifetime, I can remember only two actually good presidential candidates instead of the usual "least of all evils" choices we are often presented with. The first was Raul Roco who ran in 1998 and [2004](/2004/05/halalan-2004/) and the second was of course former VP Leni Robredo who ran last year. Both were excellent candidates who were ultimately rejected by the electorate. 

I saw someone post recently that they weren't bitter over Leni's loss because the country "wasn't ready" for her type of leadership. This is a good sentiment, but when is the country ever going to be ready for good candidates? We weren't in 1998/2004 and we still weren't two decades later. Instead the electorate keeps on electing the same people to high office again and again - *trapos* and dynasts and celebrities running purely on name recognition and bumbling do-nothing toadies to the previous administration comprise the majority of our Senate these days. The electorate still lets itself be swayed by propaganda and song-and-dance, never seeming to take seriously the challenge of nation-building. It's hard to fault the common citizenry when most people spend most of their energy just trying to survive and so don't really have the space for trying to figure out which candidates are just grifters and conmen. When is it going to change? 

### Infinite Crises

It feels like we are often a country defined by crises. In the midst of a looming El Nino we are having a water supply crisis in Metro Manila. 

We are still deep in an education and literacy crisis, exacerbated by the pandemic and making it even harder to develop an informed citizenry, all while our current education secretary seems focused on appearances and red-tagging and confidential funds.

The past year seems marked by food prices spiking due to a number of crises related to agricultural supply and smuggling, and despite multiple legislative hearings and all the talk we hear about supposed cartels and price manipulation it seems like nobody is being held to account.

And of course the climate crisis is in full swing, leading to record high temperatures even during the supposed rainy season.

The government seems focused on branding and appearances, and is not even able to avoid scandal on that front. 

Our tourism industry is hobbled by constant problems in air travel, including an embarassing incident where the entire country's airspace had to be shut down temporarily due to some kind of faulty equipment.

[The bureaucracy continues to be terrible](/2023/07/bureaucracy/). (This is possibly true for all countries, but I am certain we are worse than average.)

[Poverty and inequality are still rampant](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2023/7/23/45-percent-ph-families-feel-poor.html).

I was planning to renew my drivers' license next month, but apparently the LTO is still unable to issue real ID cards?

Speaking of ID cards, we signed up for the national ID last year. None of us have received an actual national ID card. My parents got a piece of paper that anyone could print. We were promised secure biometrics and everything! I am not confident we will see an actual national ID soon, if at all.

Here in the NCR we are still plagued by a transportation crisis. I just never go out during rush hour anymore. 

Healthcare continues to be a challenge. A lot of my doctor friends are constantly complaining about Philhealth not reimbursing payments.

### Accountability

The ICC is proceeding to investigate former president Duterte. A senator says the ICC has no jurisdiction because "our justice system is working", especially ironic since he and his family made a name for themselves by exploiting, er, "helping" people who felt they had no recourse through the traditional justice system.

One of the biggest problems in this country still is the slow pace of justice and the lack of accountability especially for people in higher office.

Two years ago the DepEd was called out for the purchase of overpriced and outdated laptops. The issue was investigated by the senate and everything. The Ombudsman is only now starting to look into it.

Our current president's family has billions in estate tax arrears, decided with finality, that they simply refuse to pay.

A senator was cleared of the PDAF scandal (his subordinate was convicted instead) but he was ordered to return the disbursed money. He has refused to do so and was re-elected last year.

A few months ago a provincial governor was murdered during an assassination attempt in his own home. A sitting congressman was the prime suspect and pointed to by the slay suspects as the mastermind. Today, all the suspects have recanted their testimony and the case seems to be going nowhere.

During the previous administration, the tourism secretary was caught giving a sweetheart media deal to a show produced by her brother. The deal was rescinded after being flagged by government auditors but part of the money was already paid out and [they have refused to return the money](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1015432/teo-bro-wont-return-p60m-even-if-your-eyes-turn-white).

It just feels like higher-ups are never called to account. It's been that way for as long as I've been aware of political scandals in this country.

### Good things

I am a bit happy on the local government front. I think our current mayor is doing a decent job, especially on the active transport front. Still lots of room for improvement, but a lot of people seem happy to bike in QC these days. Maybe someday I can join them. Also, unlike the national government, the LGU was actually able to issue us QC IDs!

At least the Metro Manila subway and new MRT lines are chugging along. I am looking forward to these lines becoming operational and hopefully taking a huge dent out of our transportation and traffic crisis.

### Hope and Optimism

All of the above paints a bleak picture of the country. I no longer have the optimism of youth because I've been here a while and am largely disillusioned by how very little seems to change. I do not see how we get the country to a better place.

But I still hold out a bit of hope, especially in the youth. I can see a lot of younger people becoming more aware of the issues facing our country and becoming more active and I'm hoping they can somehow find a path forward even if our generation has largely failed them. Even the idea of me doing these SONA posts every year is a sign of lingering optimism: the optimism that although the baseline is pretty bad, if I start writing these year-on-year I will slowly but surely start to see more good things and improvements.
