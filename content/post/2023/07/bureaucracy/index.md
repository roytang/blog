title: Government Bureaucracy Rants
---

This post is an exhibit of why I dislike the idea of starting a business here in the country. I have a friend who helps run some small businesses for his family and he will often rant to me about stupid government bureaucracy requirements. I've collected some of his rants over the years and had his permission to collect them into a blog post (appropriately edited, sanitized and anonymized of course).

### Environmental and business permits and redundant requirements

(This one is about a small building they lease out to tenants)

> Right now our major headache is complying with DENR EMB and Laguna development authority. 
> 
> Our little commercial building has to have a pollution control officer, hazardous waste production license, etc. Even though our only "hazardous waste"
is a couple pounds of lights each year 

Me: lights as in bulbs?

> Yes!
> 
> Aside from that there are so many redundant requirements. Also just for the city business permit you need brgy permit, all these clearances, and to get the various clearances you have to provide the same info and permits over and over. 
> 
> Like now we need a brgy permit for the DENR stuff. Well city hall collected our brgy permit as a requirement for the business permit months ago. So now we need another Different agencies require their own copies of the same shit. Even if they won't ever do anything with the info 90% of the time. Like they shouldn't collect that stuff by default, they should collect it only if they're going to investigate a business that's delinquent.
> 
> For example: BIR requires businesses to provide a list of inventory even if they don't sell stuff! It's like wtf. There is absolutely no need for them to have that info from businesses that are reporting their income and paying taxes. If they decide to audit, then they can ask for whatever, but asking for it as a default requirement? It's just one more thing they can fine you for for non compliance even if they have no plausible need for the info except in one circumstance
> 
> And the environmental requirements, we have to satisfy both the DENR and Laguna development.
> 
> And it's like we're not a factory; we don't have chemical by products. We actually produce less waste than a household because the building itself has very few appliances, produces very little garbage--tenants are required to have their own arrangements. It's not a shopping mall with generators and thousands of square meters that are lit and air-conditioned producing tons of wastewater and sewage.
> 
> And you shouldn't need a locational clearance renewal unless the building has a significant structural change. If it got a clearance once and nothing changes why do you need to get another? If it's for safety, there's fire and building inspectors who come even if you have the locational and occupancy papers so what do they actually accomplish other than collecting more fines and fees?
> 
> If you're closing a business without debts or bankruptcy, the paperwork to do so should be trivial, not require several days of work from an accountant
> 
> What even is the brgy permit for since they don't inspect the building themselves. Why even require it, if a business has to jump through all these holes to get the city business permit??
>

Me: What is laguna development authority. Your building is in laguna?

> No but because our water is from Laguna... We also fall under them
>

Me: wut

> It's bullshit
>

Me: what is locational clearance

> It's a requirement for businesses involving the layout and structure, separate from the occupancy permit and sanitary permit. 

Me: yes, which part of government requires it

> City hall for business permits and probably other stuff
> 

Me: this is why i dont like the idea of starting my own business lol

> Getting the denr clearances, the consultants we hired are asking for: Building plans, site layout, plumbing stuff, septic tank stuff. All things that needed to have been approved before the building was even built!!! If they were approved before why do we need to provide them again!!!
> 
> I'm very tempted to just sell the building and put all the money in high dividend local stocks
> 
> Seriously, what bullshit is it that we need a pollution control officer and hazardous waste producer license for light bulbs. That's the sort of thing where
Garbage collection should impose sorting. Not require a whole other license!!
>
> One of the requirements for the environmental stuff is an org chart
> 
> Whut
> 
> It has two people. My wife as owner and pollution control officer. And a part time caretaker who mostly just acts as a janitor
> 
> Paperwork should be rational and requirements should be proportional to business size. Like it's perfectly sensible for our other business to have these environmental requirements. They actually produce chemical wastes and there's 40 employees. But for renting out a small building with less than 500 sqm that only has light bulbs as the "hazardous waste"
>
> Wtf

### Incentivies

> Also it's like incentivized bad behavior and bribery. Complying in good faith will cost us more than P100k. Plus more than P80k annually
> 
> We were fined this year because last year a demand letter was sent say the start of the pandemic and didn't get to us. Our fine was 10,000.
> 
> By not complying we skipped on a year of having to pay environmental consultants to help us with all these stupid reports that are going to say this month were replaced and disposed of one fluorescent light.
> 
> It's like... We're lucky my wife has taken pollution control officer training before for our other business. But can you imagine all these small businesses now being required to hire someone or find someone to take the certification? Over light bulbs???
> 

### Annual fire inspection

> You have annual fire inspection. Why does the inspection certificate have to be a requirement for the business permit, when fire inspectors and building inspectors impose their own penalties and demands???
> 
> Just give the business permits and let the fire and building ppl handle safety like they already do. And make denying a business permit the nuclear option for businesses refusing to comply with the fire and building inspectors.
> 
> There's too much burden on regular taxpayers as a default. Instead of as part of escalation during enforcement.
> 

### Cedula and national ID

> And like the cedula is essentially pointless. They don't check anything before giving you one. So why is it a requirement for so many things??
> 
> It might as well not exist. It's just one more thing they can make you pay a fee on even though it gives them no useful verified info that isn't already mandatory with the BIR. 
> 
> It's utterly wasteful. An entire document that provides nothing, requires money to print, staff to handle it all. It's bullshit.
> 
> And the national id is going to be a whole new massive thing that will require documents, money, and staff, procurement contracts, fees. Then it will become a redundant requirement for other things.
>

Note: This rant was from 2 years ago, we still don't have actual national ID cards as of today. Those paper printouts they give out don't count!


### DTI permit renewal

> Why does the DTI permit need to be renewed?? What purpose does it serve after the first one to certify that a company is legit??? After that isn't it enough that the business needs to maintain business permits and pay taxes? What purpose is there for requiring DTI renewal other than collecting fees? It's like the occupancy and locational and sanitary papers, if nothing changes, what purpose does it serve to renew them? Safety stuff is handled by fire and building inspection. Business validity is maintained by business permits and tax payments. 
> 
> There are so many things that just give government workers busy work and waste tax money
> 

### Operators permits for air conditioners

> You realize for this little building we needed to get operators permits. For air conditioners!!! As if they're industrial heavy equipment!
> 
> We don't have some fancy ventilation system, tt's individual ac for individual rooms, like residential. It's ridiculous
> 

### Building Diagrams for the BIR

> I'm putting off having to do a building diagram for the BIR which has absolutely no need for such information which is already in the records of [LGU] city hall. Seriously what is the BIR going to do with building layouts?? The city halls have those records already. And those building plans submitted for the permits are way more detailed than the amateur drawings of ppl submitting to the BIR. What's the point?? Will the BIR hire engineers with redundant skills just to make sure rented spaces aren't 1 square meter off? How does that even matter if what they're taxing is the rent?
>

### My Notes

A lot of these seem like the result of decades of requirements piled on top of each other and different agencies not communicating and not having shared databases and bureaucrats who don't care to rationalize and sort everything out as long as they are collecting fees. My impression is that this whole mess has been the status quo for decades. It's fine for big conglomorates who can afford to hire people to do all this stuff (and place bribes appropriately etc), but terrible for small businesses. I don't think anyone in the bureaucracy is incentivized to actually clean this stuff up. 

I believe there have been attempts to pass laws to streamline all these processes but most of them just enforce time limits (i.e. process must be done in N days, etc) and no one is actually doing any sort of cross-agency process rationalization. One example of a law passed is the [Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/661492/duterte-to-bureaucracy-implement-anti-red-tape-law-faithfully/story/). All of the above rants are from after this law was passed
