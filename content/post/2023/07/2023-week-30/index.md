### The World

Early this week, in what almost everyone universally agrees is a pretty boneheaded decision, Elon Musk started to rebrand Twitter as "X". He's been obsessed with the letter "X" as an "everything app" for years, but apparently never bothered to trademark it or even grab the Twitter handle before he bought the social media platform. It is suggested that buying a social media platform was never the goal, he just wanted to bootstrap his everything app, but I kind of think he's making things up on the fly.

The president gave his state of the nation address last Monday. I did not care. Country was hit hard by tropical storm Egay this week. And the rains continue until today. On the other hand, [PH women are doing well in sports](/2023/07/110775579997807543/)!

In science: A Korean team claims to have created [the first room temperature superconductor](https://phys.org/news/2023-07-korean-team-room-temperature-ambient-pressure-superconductor.html). Big if true!

### My Week

My week felt super routine and I was getting some stuff done that I had been meaning to do, but then Thursday afternoon [my phone was stolen](/2023/07/stolen-phone/). After that followed a stressful couple of days, but things are mostly calming down now.

Wrote [my own State of the Nation](/2023/07/sona2023/).

Trivia team [attended a quiz night last Thursday](/2023/07/popquiz-seven-years-later/); I was able to attend despite my misfortunes.

I feel a bit lost, but hopefully things start picking up. Unfortunately, we are still waiting on some potentially bad news.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Still playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**, but completion is only around 50% so far.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Same old regular constructed grinding. Some early previews of the next set came out last weekend, but that's still like 5 or 6 weeks away I think. Need to save up more gold for drafts.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. 
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: Still working on world tour, alternating with Battle Hub matches.

- **Reading**: Finished reading: [Gideon the Ninth](/2023/07/gideon-the-ninth/). I also wrote about [what manga I've been reading lately](/2023/07/2023-manga-update/). Still reading a bunch of Marvel comics. *Fall of X* is on!

- **Watching**: Finished up some animated movies I had left half-finished because I watched them with the niece: [Puss in Boots The Last Wish (2022)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#puss-in-boots-the-last-wish-2022) and [Soul (2020)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#soul-2020). Finishing Puss in Boots was relevant to our recent quiz night lol. Finished *Secret Invasion* and [was very disappointed](/2023/07/secret-invasion-tv/). *Strange New Worlds* [continues to be so good](/2023/07/110762663445495965/). I also watched the first couple of episodes of *Star Trek Prodigy*, not sure yet if I want to continue this.

### Walking

I already have a temporary replacement phone and so can access my Fitbit data already. This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,482 steps and burned 25,435 cals. I still hit my targets despite basically not seeing my steps counts since Thursday evening (my tracker's display is broken), which is a minor miracle.

- [Reading Well - by Simon Sarris - The Map is Mostly Water](https://map.simonsarris.com/p/reading-well): > I also tend to stress fiction because I think, especially among my professional peers in the industry of software, that there is too great a fondness for non-fiction. I think this arises from a belief that superior knowledge of the world comes from non-fiction. This thought is attractive to people who build systems, but over-systematizing and seeing systems in everything can be a failure mode. Careful descriptions and summaries miss too much of the world. Hard distinctions make bad philosophy.

### Things I've been thinking about

Midriffs, privacy, the open web, DRM, how much control sites should have over the content they publish, UI updates, mastodon, fediverse, memes, quitting Twitter for good, petty theft, security, carelessness, hassles, exhaustion, grudges, waiting, never forgetting, etc

### Things I'm looking forward to

- **Baldur's Gate 3** is officially releasing this week and I'm kind of still waffling about buying it because *Starfield* comes out in a month and I can play that via PC Game Pass, so maybe I should focus on that first? Been watching reviews of BG3 though, it looks so good! Odds are high that I will give in to temptation before Thursday.
- We also have a quiz night scheduled this week (coincidentally Thursday as well), but trivia team is not too fond of the topics, so we might skip.
- I could use a good week.
