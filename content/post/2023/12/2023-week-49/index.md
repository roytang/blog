title: 2023 Week 49 Running Out of Year
---

It is now week 49 of 2023. I forget where I read it but I saw a post which said the OP was "running out of year" and I was like, aren't we all?

### The World

Not much has changed. The world continues to be terrible. 

### My Week

I spent most of Tuesday (starting in the early morning) in bureaucratic queues trying to get some stuff processed and basically got almost nothing done. Doing this kind of legwork eats away at my soul a bit and I felt a lingering exhaustion for most of the week. It's not yet done, more to come this week!

My printer is being dumb. IDK how to explain it.

It's December, so [Reddit Recap](/12/reddit-recap/) is out.

Trivia Team has been enjoying the [Cine2Nerdle](https://www.cinenerdle2.app/) puzzles recently. This week, they released a new online versus mode called battles which we enjoyed a lot, but almost immediately suspended the mode because of some performance issues I think? They say it will be back next week, but in the meantime, we uploaded some recordings of us playing battles over on [the Team Camote PH youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph).

Last weekend, a former coworker passed away from cancer at the young age of 48. Life is short.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: A big one; I finally finished **Baldur's Gate 3** last Thursday! I [streamed the ending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zTloE2mpg4)! I've been playing this one since August! I'll write a review sometime this week. Now I can focus on finishing **Sea of Stars** as well!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. I am mostly done with Lost Caverns of Ixalan, the set has been terrible for me. Snap had some major changes/rebalances this week, but they were kind of meh.

- **Reading**: I have started reading a book. IDK if I will finish it. Also slowly ramping up into the Doctor Strange stuff.

- **Watching**: Finished some series so I wrote a new TV reviews post for [Blue Eye Samurai, Scrubs, and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off](/2023/12/tv-bes-scrubs-pilgrim/).

### Walking

Managed to hit 70,527 steps this week, once again hitting my weekly target! No notes.

### Site Changes

- Still cleaning up old content on the site.
- Something I've wanted to do for a while: I revamped the UI shown when viewing images in a lightbox. I hadn't made any major changes to it since [I first implemented the HTML/CSS only lightbox](/2020/07/hugo-lightbox/). Prev/next navigation used to be these big clunky arrows on the side. I wanted things to be "prettier" so I made a navigation bar with icons! UI isn't my strong suit, so I tried asking for help from Bing Copilot/ChatGPT with some CSS stuff and which attributes I should provide for accessibility purposes. The SVG icons are from [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/).

### Things I've been thinking about

My own pack rat tendecies, archives and backup, refusing to let things go, dread, indecisiveness, looking for work again, inflation vs restaurant prices and serving sizes, financial projections, next week's plans, death and time passing.

### Things I'm looking forward to

- Live action Yu Yu Hakusho is out this week!
