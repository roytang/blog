There was this thing (meme?) that was going around on different blogs about [people posting their default apps](https://defaults.rknight.me/) and I wasn't particularly interested in doing it, yet here I am.

Maybe I'll add to this one if I think of other things to log.

This made me remember that back in the day when I used to reinstall Windows a lot I kept a list of "things to install" on a fresh copy of Windows and I think I have a copy saved somewhere and maybe I'll try to find it and post it at some point too.

Honestly I was much more interested in how this spread. The page linked at the top includes a list of people who have done this "meme", and an OPML file you can follow, and you can add yourself to the list via Github. Is this how we do hashtags in the blogosphere?!? Is the blogosphere still a thing?!?
