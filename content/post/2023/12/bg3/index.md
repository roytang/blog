title: Baldur's Gate 3
---

I finished Baldur's Gate 3 last Thursday, right before it won game of the year at the recent Game Awards. This isn't really a review so much as just some notes I have on the game. It's gotten so much media exposure there's not really much to say about it. It's great, play it, indulge yourself. Just all the hard work and love and craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into this game makes me happy. This release wasn't even on [my radar at the start of the year](/2023/01/2023-checklist/#games) so it was a very pleasant surprise.

### Notes

- My current playtime is at something like 90 hours, and that's only for ONE PLAYTHROUGH! It took me so long to get through the game, I started playing it way back in August. 
- I think I made the many of the most common choices - Paladin as my custom character, romancing Shadowheart etc. For games like this with a lot of freedom of choice my decisions tend to be an almost cartoonish "lawful good", so Paladins are always appropriate.
- I want to do a second playthrough with the Dark Urge and go down the more evil paths, but who knows if I will find time for that? 
- I didn't want to spend too much time min-maxing my characters, so for the entire run I never tried multiclassing. That's another thing I will explore in a potential second walkthrough, in addition to classes I haven't tried.
- Companion notes:
    - Lae'zel: Best fighting companion of choice. I typically had her in the second-best gear after the MC. Level 12 fighter's 3 attacks + extra actions means she can either take out a bunch of weaker foes or focus fire on stronger bosses easily. Lots of options with the superiority dice as well. 
    - Gale: Took a while to warm up to him, but he eventually became a bread-and-butter party member. Level 12 wizards are a consistent source of both pinpoint damage and AoE.
    - Shadowheart: I chose her for the romance option because frankly I'm not especially interested in romancing RPG companions and she seemed like the easy default choice. As a cleric, I found most of the higher level spells wanting, but of course typically I never used the Divine Intervention. Most often her use in combat is to have upcast Guardian Spirits on and take out lesser mooks (and extra healing of course).
    - Astarion: Super annoying. I know the VA won best performance at the Game Awards and I can appreciate that, but the character just exudes a lot of that smarmy charm that I find so off-putting in real-life. Also I feel like level 12 rogues aren't as useful as the other classes, but that might just be because I hadn't optimized his loadouts because I dislike him. I mostly still tagged him in to pick locks and disarm traps though.
    - Wyll: Least favorite spellcaster. I brought him in when he was story-relevant, but not much else.
    - Karlach: Never used her much, other than when she was story-relevant. Level 12 barbarian not getting access to heavy armor meant I almost always preferred having Lae'zel around instead.
    - Halsin: Meh. Never used him much. Orin kidnapped him in Act 3 and I didn't bother recovering him until late in my run.
    - Jaheira: Druid of choice and most common 4th party member after Lae'zel and Gale. Owlbear form is great for smashing things and she served as good backup spell damage (Lightning Bolt) or healing.
    - Minsc: I did the quest to recruit him mostly for nostalgia purposes, but didn't use him much after that. 
    - Minthara: Only companion I missed. I think I killed her in Act 1 before knowing she could actually be recruited. I would prioritize her on a second run.
- The choices and decision making in the game are excellent, with many of them not having a strictly "Good" / "Evil" decision point and some even made me pause and reconsider what would be the "best" choice. 
- I find that I much prefer the turn-based combat here (modeled after the Divinity: Original Sin series) compared to the "Turn-based with Pause" system from Baldur's Gate 1 and 2. I was able to appreciate the mechanics much more, and the D&D systems really feel better this way. And rolling the dice is fun (though could be more keyboard friendly.)
- Actually I found the story a lot more engrossing than BG1 and 2 I think. I certainly felt a lot more immersed in the Forgotten Realms this time; it may have been helped by the fact that we had a couple of recent D&D crossover Magic sets, so I was a bit more familiar with Faerun lore this time around.
- I dislike that in Act III you hit the level cap of 12 pretty quickly; I think I spent like 60% of Act III at level 12. I understand why they were hesitant to implement the higher levels and the fact that you tackle many of the later challenges at around the same level helps with the nonlinearity, but still it's annoying whenever I find myself earning so much useless XP. Maybe I could have been granted gold instead?

### Stats / Completion

Playtime: 90.7 hours

Achievements: 31/54

I could probably squeeze a few more achievements out of the current playthrough if I backtrack to an older save and make some different decisions but I'm not inclined to at the moment.

Happy to take a break from the game for now, but will try to come back for a second run at some point to explore paths less travelled, time permitting. (There are so many games to play and gone are the days when I had time to do like the Paragon run and the Renegade run and then one more run for kicks.)

Achievement completion for this game is highly unlikely since a recent update added an "Ironman" Honour mode, which I probably won't have the patience for.
