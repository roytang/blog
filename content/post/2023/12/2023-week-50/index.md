title: 2023 Week 50
---

It is now week 50 of 2023 and the third Sunday of Advent. TIL that this is called the ["Gaudete Sunday"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaudete_Sunday) meaning "Rejoice", because Christmas is near.

Two weeks remain in the year!

### The World

Andre Braugher has died, RIP. 

The world continues to be sad. The IDF killed some hostages.

Threads has taken it's first steps towards fediverse integration and this has caused a big brouhaha/debate on the timelines, between the camps of "Cautiously giving this a chance" and "NO CHANCE". I do not have a take on all this (yet).

### My Week

Early in the week I spent some effort on my recent bureaucracy legwork errands but basically was told that backlogs are so long I can't get anything done until next year. I am both saddened at not accomplishing anything and relieved that I don't have to think about it for a couple of weeks. Other than that, the a bunch of mid-month medical errands: my own regularly-scheduled doctor visit, buying meds, getting my mom some new glasses, etc.

I think I fixed my printer? IDK how exactly, it took so many resets but I was finally able to print some documents yesterday.

One of my external hard drives was also having problems. Windows was failing to recognize it. I finally decided to check it on my Macbook which was not only able to detect it, but I had the Disk Utility Repair run on it for a couple of hours and afterwards Windows could detect it again! Hooray! I should probably still get a new external drive though. I am still annoyed by how quickly these things start to fail. (The current one is only around 3 years old.)

Around October of last year, I decided to apply for a [PhilSys](https://philsys.gov.ph/) National ID on a whim despite not really being optimistic about the project ever being useful. Last Thursday, after 14 months I got a call telling me I could now claim my PhilSys ID at the nearby barangay hall! I claimed it last Friday so at least I have an extra government ID.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Wrote my [Baldur's Gate 3 review](/2023/12/bg3/). Also spent a good part of the week playing **Sea of Stars**, I believe I am already right before the final dungeon so I am spending some time doing completion stuff first.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, and still managed to get some **Eternal** in even. I have also once again managed to waste time and resources [attempting the Arena Open](/2023/12/ktk-arena-open/) this weekend. Twice!
    - Some gaming-related 2023 recaps came in: [Twitch](/2023/12/twitch-recap/), [XBox/Game Pass](/2023/12/111573059124863178/), [Nintendo Switch](/2023/12/111575726367894281/)

- **Reading**: Slowly getting into the Doctor Strange stuff; v1 was really short and I have already started v2. Having trouble finishing this book I started last week. It was not a good choice for me

- **Watching**: Huh, nothing major this week. Catching up some stuff I've fallen behind on. Randomly watched an episode of *Homicide Life on the Street* on Youtube because of Andre Braugher. Started watching *Wheel of Time* season 2. I have not yet started the live-action YYH, seems that reviews are mixed.

### Walking

I finished the week with 70,109 logged in Goole Fit. I actually had a bit more steps than that because I went out on a short errand worth around 2k steps and forgot to bring my phone.

I've decided to cut myself some slack for the last two weeks of the year and loosen my walking goals temporarily. I'll still take my walks when I can, but I won't pressure myself to hit the 70k weekly quota.

### Some Links of Interest

- [How to fix the internet | MIT Technology Review](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/10/17/1081194/how-to-fix-the-internet-online-discourse): 

    > "The fix for the internet isn’t to shut down Facebook or log off or go outside and touch grass. The solution to the internet is more internet: more apps, more spaces to go, more money sloshing around to fund more good things in more variety, more people engaging thoughtfully in places they like. More utility, more voices, more joy."

    I think I read this a couple of months ago when it came out and forgot to share it then

- [Pipe Dreams: The life and times of Yahoo Pipes](https://retool.com/pipes): I didn't get into Yahoo Pipes, but I thought the idea was neat and probably ahead of its time, but probably wouldn't have worked in today's silo-focused internet.

### Site Changes

- Still cleaning up old content on the site.
- Working on a new section, rethinking the site structure, might take a while.

### Things I've been thinking about

Bureaucracy, endless queues, the challenges of being poor and having to rely on this government for handouts, trying to avail of said handouts when there are many more people worse off than we are who could better use those benefits, godchildren, relative links, death, mortality, how to make sure things aren't challenging for people we leave behind, things I want to get done before the year's end, 2024 planning, Christmas

### Things I'm looking forward to

I'm hoping the last couple of weeks of the year are chill and I can use that time to catch up on things I've been wanting to read/watch/etc.

I still have one more movie to watch on [my 2023 checklist](/2023/01/2023-checklist/), which is the Aquaman sequel, but it's coming out in MMFF season so I suspect it will be watched in 2024 instead.

TV-wise, there's Marvel's What If season 2 remaining to look forward to for the year.

### Ephemera

Whenever I'm about to hit publish on one of these, I always wonder if I forgot anything. Blog posts in general, not just weeknotes.
