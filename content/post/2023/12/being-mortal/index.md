It has been a rough couple of years. 

Two years ago my parents and I were hospitalized for Covid and I lost sleep as I watched my father's vitals struggle through the night as he slept. Last year one of my oldest and closest friends passed away unexpectedly. This year my mom had her third bout with cancer. She is fine; surgery went well, but this coming year we are faced with expensive immunotherapy treatments and have had to discuss things like remission rates, survival rates and quality of life decisions.

All of this means I've found myself thinking more about death and mortality. When my parents stay out too late I wonder what if something has happened to them? What would I do if they were in an accident? And I start imagining what-ifs and how I'd need to talk to people and things like that. I end up having to shake my head free of bad thoughts and maybe say a prayer.

I'm not especially concerned or afraid about dying myself, but I do worry about what happens to the people I leave behind. When I feel any sort of body pain the thought "Is this it?" momentarily passes through my brain. When I'm out walking I remind myself to be more careful on the streets because it would be a big hassle if I got into an accident. I always make sure I carry some form of ID on me when I walk any significant distance away, so that my loved ones can be contacted. I've set up a document my loved ones can refer to in case something happens to me. I have no idea how my family is going to dispose of all of the stuff I've collected (there are soooo many Magic cards!)

It feels a bit weird thinking about things like this when 10 years ago I didn't really consider them at all. It's most likely just that I'm at that age where many people of the generation older than me are starting to die off, and at the same time some people of my cohort are passing away as well. When we're young we feel invincible, but as time scrolls forward the inevitable finality of death starts to loom larger in your life.

It doesn't help that we are living in an era where there are people constantly victimized by warfare, capitalism, fascism, and the ever-looming threat of climate change. 

### Time

One of my favorite nonfiction books that I read this year was [Four Thousand Weeks by Oliver Burkman](/2023/03/four-thousand-weeks/), a book about accepting the limitations on our time imposed by our limited human lifespans. 

Now I find myself thinking about many of the things I do in terms of me clinging on to life and refusing to let go. 

Blogging, backups, archiving are all ways to have my thoughts and memories last longer, perhaps hopefully outlasting my own life. Accumulating all these backlogs like books to read, movies to watch, games to play, etc is a way of saying "Screw that!" to the limited time we have in this world and wanting to enjoy everything life has to offer anyway. 

It can be a double-edged sword as it also means I have difficulty letting things go; I spend too much time reminiscing about the past and wishing I was still there. I still rue past decisions and wish I could bring back things that have been lost to time or friendships that have fallen apart.

All of these feel like clinging to life and refusing to be mortal.

### Life is short, no regrets

Or so I keep trying to tell myself.

I wasn't sure if I should write about this topic, especially at this time of year as it is decidedly un-festive. And maybe these are just normal thoughts to have at this age? But I've had these thoughts running around my head for most of this year I think, and it felt appropriate to write about these anxieties as the year came to a close. I do believe that committing our thoughts and fears and anxieties to the written word gives us a measure of power over them, so perhaps that's what this is. And maybe also a reminder to myself that it's only natural (and human!) to worry about death and mortality and our limited time on this world, especially as your age starts to creep up on you. 

I am reminded of a Peanuts image I saw some years back (I am unsure if it is actually from a Peanuts strip):

Nothing lasts forever. Someday we will all be gone, perhaps even all humanity will be nothing more than a speck in the infinity of time. But in spite of these certainties and thoughts and fears and anxieties, we are still alive now, in the present, in this moment, and we should not spend so much time either clinging to the past or worrying about the future that we forget about the present. And maybe that's a good lesson to end the year with and to start the new one with.
