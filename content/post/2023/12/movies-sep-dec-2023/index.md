#### The Italian Job (2003)

<time id="the-italian-job-2003">[2023-09-18 23:02] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/9/4/7/46947-the-italian-job-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=eff66e8c8e" /></p> <p>For some reason I came into this thinking it was about stealing cars? Some good driving scenes though. An entertaining heist movie; I love the ones that have elaborate heist plans that have to be adjusted at the last minute. Having Charlie and Stella end up together seemed unnecessary though.</p>

#### 47 Ronin (2013)

<time id="47-ronin-2013">[2023-09-30 00:08] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/7q/cu/fc/rt/4D5LM8BRdWuBQXSjLh1iAddchdM-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=fd1bd4de94" /></p> <p>I was so distracted at the start of the film because one of the characters is named "Oishi", which means "delicious"?!? I guess it's a different pronunciation but still.</p><p>Found out later it was based on an actual Japanese historical story and that makes inserting a white guy into the story and making them all speak English even more of a travesty lol.</p><p>That being said, I did enjoy the fight scenes and the final raid at the end.</p>

---

#### Man on Fire (2004)

<time id="man-on-fire-2004">[2023-09-30 00:10] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/vy/z4/mq/qc/qAbRLPe8T7ehKzr1Tgo78T7ASrS-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=7b09147ed3" /></p> <p>The director loves doing these exposition/atmospheric scenes with a lot of strobing lights and it's super annoying. The film is very dark and intense, but Denzel's character is very methodical and specific in his vengeance, never doing it out of sadism, just enough to extract the information he needs. I mostly watched this because I heard Denzel and Dakota are reuniting 20 years later in Equalizer 3 lol</p>

#### Air (2023)

<time id="air-2023">[2023-09-30 06:34] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/6/8/4/9/1/868491-air-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=0dddab89c6" /></p> <p>Surprisingly good, for a two-hour Nike ad.</p>

---

#### Fantastic Four (2015)

<time id="fantastic-four-2015">[2023-10-02 19:39] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/2/3/0/6/5/123065-fantastic-four-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=1399b230e4" /></p> <p>Way too serious and missing the heart that made the 2005 film work well enough to get a sequel. I do like the cast and the fact that the military industrial complex tries to take advantage of the kids with these powers, feels very realistic. Given that, the ending/epilogue came out of nowhere and made no sense given the rest of the movie; I guess it was part of the reported reshoots?</p><p>Also yet another attempt to have Doom be a metal-skinned weirdo with unexplained powers. Just once I'd like to have him just be a horribly scarred and smart yet narcissistic tyrant who despises Reed for showing him up!</p><p>It did make me dig out my copy of Ultimate Fantastic Four vol 1 for a re-read though.</p>

#### Transformers: Rise of the Beasts (2023)

<time id="transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-2023">[2023-10-04 23:24] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/2/3/1/8/592318-transformers-rise-of-the-beasts-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=4c6c375975" /></p> <p>Slightly better than I expected it to be, probably in the upper half for the live-action series overall. </p><p>They are at least getting better at having the different robots distinguishable from each other (mostly through more prominent metal coloring on each one), though the entire movie went by without telling us the names of Scourge's two goons. Big messy CGI fight at the end though.</p><p>Wikipedia says this one is supposed to be both a sequel to Bumblebee (2018) and a prequel to Transformers (2007), but there's no way that makes sense continuity-wise.</p>

---

#### Blue Beetle (2023)

<time id="blue-beetle-2023">[2023-10-05 23:04] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/9/4/2/4/8/494248-blue-beetle-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=6368aaa0ca" /></p> <p>This one was okay, had a lot of heart, though I feel like we see the "family" theme in superhero films a bit too often. I was kind of expecting some kind of involvement from Beetle's alien origins, but I guess that can be saved for sequels, if we get any.</p>

---

#### Tenet (2020)

<time id="tenet-2020">[2023-10-10 23:47] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/sm/upload/pq/9f/sr/vt/aCIFMriQh8rvhxpN1IWGgvH0Tlg-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=f3165fe17f" /></p> <p>Enjoyed this one but it was a bit hard on the brain especially around the middle. Pretty good action and the plot mindbending to say the least. It wasn't that bad if you don't spend too much time trying to plot out all the timelines and puzzle over the loopholes but I suspect that plot was still way too complicated for the mass market audience and that Nolan lucked out with the pandemic happening as it did to lower box office expectations.</p>

#### The Equalizer (2014)

<time id="the-equalizer-2014">[2023-10-20 23:11] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/1/1/6/8/2/5/116825-the-equalizer-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=a10d34a9da" /></p> <p>I initially thought this one would be like John Wick: fast, intense and action-packed. Instead it turned out to be slow, deliberate, methodical and tense, much like the title character. Pretty good actually.</p>

---

#### A Haunting in Venice (2023)

<time id="a-haunting-in-venice-2023">[2023-10-31 23:42] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/8/5/0/3/7/5/850375-a-haunting-in-venice-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=e6956812f9" /></p> <p>Clever of Disney+ to have this out on Halloween, it was an appropriate time to watch.</p><p>I think I enjoyed this one the most out of Branagh's 3 Poirot films so far, certainly better than _Nile_. I haven't read the book it was based on, although I read that it was a loose adaptation. Good use of camera work to portray the more "supernatural" elements of the case. Decent performances, though I often have trouble taking Tina Fey seriously. </p><p>I kind of suspected the final culprit but couldn't explain why, though in hindsight the case might have been solveable, had one been paying attention. (I have never solved any of these Christie stories ahead of time, I just like to imagine that I could have!)</p>

#### Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)

<time id="indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-2023">[2023-12-02 23:50] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/2/6/5/4/3/3/265433-indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=34f4a02c6b" /></p> <p>This was a fun ride, but I feel like too much of the movie is dedicated to the whole "fighting Nazis" side of Indy and could have used a bit more tomb-raiding and puzzle-solving.</p><p>Fleabag's character was ok, though I wish she and the kid got a bit more of a conclusion at the end of it all. Also, I found hilarious the canon explanation as to why Shia Lebouf is not in this film lol.</p><p>That bit towards the end makes this one of the more fantastical Indy films, but not as much as Crystal Skull!</p>

#### They Cloned Tyrone (2023)

<time id="they-cloned-tyrone-2023">[2023-12-27 04:51] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/6/5/8/9/0/6/658906-they-cloned-tyrone-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=afe533ab4e" /></p> <p>This felt like a cross between "Blaxploitation" films and conspiracy comedies like Hot Fuzz. The former is not really my jam, but I liked the latter part of it. Kind of weird and the conspiracy involved felt over-the-top-ridiculous. Great performances by John Boyega (first time seeing him outside of Star Wars), Teyonnah Parris (first time seeing her outside of MCU) and Jamie Foxx.</p>

---

#### The Creator (2023)

<time id="the-creator-2023">[2023-12-27 04:54] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/5/9/5/0/2/9/595029-the-creator-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=b921bf1d45" /></p> <p>Visually stunning and some excellent set pieces in there and I liked the portrayal of near-future Asia being oppressed by the US military because honestly that doesn't seem too implausible. The sci-fi plot is more of an allegory for discrimination/acceptance than for our current "AI" landscape. Washington was fine, but that kid's performance was superb.</p>

---

#### The Fast and the Furious (2001)

<time id="the-fast-and-the-furious-2001">[2023-12-31 11:10] </time>

<p><img class='movie_poster'src="https://a.ltrbxd.com/resized/film-poster/4/6/8/1/3/46813-the-fast-and-the-furious-0-600-0-900-crop.jpg?v=ec37dbaf43" /></p> <p>Never seen any of this series, but the first four are up on NF, so I figured why not? I am not big on cars or racing so the plot did not particularly appeal to me, but some of the racing/chase scenes were intense. You could easily sense Paul Walker actually being a cop from the very beginning (mostly because his insistence on getting into Dom's good graces and not caring about what happens to his car makes no sense).</p>
