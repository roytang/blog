It's been a year since [I last did one of these](/2022/12/follow-friday-2/), and to think I once thought I could do it monthly maybe! Once a year will do for now.

*(It's actually Saturday as I'm writing this because I was lazy yesterday, but I'm backdating it to Friday to keep with the theme.)*

### Some Blogs You Might Like

Anyway, here are some new blogs I started following these year that I recommend. I try to describe what the content of each blog is like, but as I typically prefer to follow blogs that feature a variety of content, I may or may not be that accurate.

- [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/mind-garden/) is a writer and her blog covers a variety of topics including blogging itself. My favorite thing about her blog is that she is into the whole indieweb philosophy and often links to and quotes other blogs / posts of interests which means I get exposed to more people I might want to follow.
- [Bix Dot Blog](https://bix.blog/) by Bix Frankonis is one of my newer follows; I think I first found his site after I got a webmention or two from there and I saw some interesting posts that I thought were worth a follow. He writes a lot about his own blogging process, autism, anxiety and other such things. Like Tracy, he often cites a number of other bloggers and blog posts and thus provides avenues for finding other blogs (a recurring pattern in today's entries perhaps)
- [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/)'s blog I've been following for a while. He writes mostly about web stuff but the highlight of his blog recently has been his "People and Blogs" series where each post highlights and interviews another blogger, and the interview always ends with asking for recommendations for other blogs to follow, so yes once again a good avenue for finding other blogs!
- [Terence Eden](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/) seems to write mostly about tech stuff (web/HTML/CSS, standards, APIs, stuff like that), blogging, writing, reviews, and other miscellany. I think I found him via an old blog post related to mobile phones used in Doctor Who!
- [Interconnected](https://interconnected.org/home/) by Matt Webb. Initially wasn't sure about adding this one to the public blogroll, as I sometimes found the signal to noise ratio to be a bit low for me. He writes a lot about what I'd call "speculative" things, i.e. what if we do this, what might the future look like, what could we use this for, mostly related to tech, society, psychology etc. The content usually feels like higher-concept stuff than what I usually read which might explain why I glaze over a lot of it, but I do occasionally enjoy some of his concepts.

I think that's it for now. 

### Blogroll Update 

The above blogs are all newly added to [my public blogroll](/page/blogroll/).

I've actually added quite a number of blogs to the tentative follows list recently (thanks in part to some of the above blogs that often link to other blogs!), but most of them I haven't been following long enough to be comfortable putting them on the public blogroll, since to me that feels like essentially a recommendation.

Additionally, since I am following so many new blogs, I have found a need to unfollow some that no longer particularly interest me. In general this is not an indication of a lack of quality on those blogs, but rather perhaps that what I'm looking for in blogs to follow has changed. 

I won't name all the ones that have been removed, but I will note that with [Substack recently refusing to deplatform Nazi content](https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/21/24011232/substack-nazi-moderation-demonetization-hamish-mckenzie) I have decided to unfollow all the substack-related ones (tell me if I missed any!), which is a bit sad as there are some good ones there. I assume they will eventually find their way to other newsletter platforms (Today in Tabs has already announced an intention to be on a new platform next year for example) and maybe I will be able to find them again eventually.

### More blogroll-y things

It still feels a bit weird to be publicly following strangers via a blogroll. I mean, we all got used to following strangers on social media, but following blogs feels a lot more intimate of a connection compared to just someone's ramblings on Twitter or their photos on Instagram. It kind of feels like mingling with strangers. Tracy Durnell (see above) writes about this a bit in [Building community out of strangers](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/30/building-community-out-of-strangers/):

> Even when the conversation isn’t direct, blogging is community the way neighborhoods are — you don’t know everyone who lives nearby, everyone’s got a slightly different set of connections, but living in the same environment where common concerns might arise and sharing just some of these cross connections to hear rumblings through the grapevine means ideas and vibes will diffuse through. I might not follow someone’s feed, but get referred to their writing regularly nonetheless through others who do.

I still wish more people exposed their blogrolls in a machine-readable manner, though we currently don't have any standards for that. As an example, my site has a `<link rel="blogroll" />` element in the head that points to my blogroll's OPML file. I imagine if we had a standard for this, it could act like a replacement for the "follow" lists from social media platforms and might allow bloggers to do more interesting things with follow graphs and so on. Or maybe the lack of such automation is a feature not a bug? Having to manually find and peruse other people's blogrolls contributes to the intimacy of the connection perhaps?

Nevill Hobson writes about [A Nostalgic Journey through the Rise and Demise of the Blogroll](https://www.nevillehobson.com/2023/04/16/the-rise-and-demise-of-the-blogroll/):

> The history of blogrolls and their role in the development of social media is a tale of a seemingly lost art – the art of civil discourse. By understanding the lessons from the past, we can strive to create more inclusive, respectful online communities that value genuine connections and thought-provoking conversations.
> 
> As we navigate the ever-changing digital landscape, let’s not forget the importance of the humble blogroll and its ability to bring people together, fostering a sense of community and shared understanding.

Recently I've been considering adding a sidebar back to this site (even though recent trends seem to prefer single column sites; I am not really one for trends), but I don't know if I'd put the blogroll on a the sidebar again [like I used to back in the day](/2004/12/layouts-2004/). Well, we'll see. Maybe if I prototype it I actually end up liking how it looks.

### That's It

Next update will be in December next year I suppose? In the meantime, feel free to keep posting links to blogs and blogrolls!
