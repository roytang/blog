title: "2023 Week 51"
---

It's Christmas Eve later! Doing this weeknotes early since I expect the house to be quite busy in a few hours. Might be shorter than usual.

### The World

Colorado has banned Trump from the presidential ballot.

### My Week

This week was chill and I had time to catch up on some things I'd been meaning to. There is not much else to note!

On the blog: I wrote about [Default Apps](/2023/12/default-apps/) and [updated my blogroll](/2023/12/follow-friday-3/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finished **Sea of Stars** this week! Wrote my [review](/2023/12/sea-of-stars/)! This means I managed to finish 2 out of the 3 RPGs I decided to start back in August. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 I am unlikely to get back to and will probably end up being a DNF.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.
    - One final gaming-related 2023 recaps came in: the [one for Steam](/2023/12/111605796533635333/).

- **Reading**: Started a new Discworld book that I'm hoping I can still finish and squeeze in a review by end of the year! Also started readinga some DC stuff on top of my ongoing Doctor Strange run, which is not going at a great pace. I kind of want to write a review of non-Marvel stuff I've read recently (i.e. within the past couple of years), as a bit of a break from all the Marvel stuff, not sure if I'll get around to it.

- **Watching**: Finished **Wheel of Time** season 2! Started watching **What If** season 2! Hoping to squeeze in one more TV reviews post before year-end.

### Walking

I mentioned last week that I don't want to hold myself to a walking quota for the last two weeks of the year, but in the back of my mind I felt like if I didn't hit at least 50% of the 70k weekly target I might have trouble getting back into it after NY. Happy to report that I managed 38,215 steps this past week!

This coming week is a bit more busy though, next week's step total might be a bit less.

### Some Links of Interest

- [2023 Movie Trailer Mashup - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51XQo-JENgs): The latest in Sleepy Skunk's yearly trailer mashups

- [The great tweet archive](https://www.theverge.com/c/features/23928461/best-tweets-archive-twitter-x-funny): Curated archive of tweets since Twitter is dying. Took me a few days to get through it all. There are some bangers in there, but I wish I could just filter for "Hysterical" / "Weird", I really don't care about the "Famous" ones. Also, why is the list order randomized on every reload?!?

Not a lot this week. Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Site Changes

- Still cleaning up old content on the site.
- Some minor CSS tweaks.
- Still working on a new section, but it looks like no major changes are happening until next year. 

### Things I've been thinking about

Nostalgia, cleaning up, year end tasks, mortality, time, being excited for things with no one to share the excitement with, stuffy nose, archiving, collections

### Upcoming

It's Christmas week! We have a couple of family meetups to attend today and tomorrow. Will probably see some cousins I haven't seen since before the pandemic!

This week I'm going to work on my usual end of year/start of year posts. 

### Sign-off

Wherever you are and whatever holidays you celebrate this season, I hope you have a good one!
