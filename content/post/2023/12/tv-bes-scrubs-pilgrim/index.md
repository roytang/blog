Some TV stuff I finished watching over the past few weeks:

### Blue Eye Samurai

This is an adult animated series that released on Netflix last December. It tells the story of a bastard child of a white man in feudal Japan, hated by others and treated as a demon because of their inherited blue eyes, on a journey of revenge to kill the four white men who were in japan at the time of their birth.

It's so good; the animation is fantastic and the action is superb; it's bloody and brutal and well-written and very quotable! I saved a bunch of screenshots even:

It is a somber tale of loneliness, death, betrayal, vengeance, loyalty, honor, swordsmanship, love, duty and trying to live your life in a society that hates you and/or limits your choices because of race or gender. There is a lot of action; the encounters with the eventual villain, the white man Fowler (voiced by Kenneth Branagh), are brutally physical all-out brawl, reminding me of Matt Murdock meeting Wilson Fisk in Netflix's *Daredevil*, which is high praise.

The series did not end where I thought it would, and succeeding seasons are heavily implied. I watched the short episode run with English dubs, so I'm not sure how good the Japanese version is. It is easy enough to imagine that everyone was actually speaking in Japanese, including Fowler as he has been in Japan more than a couple of decades at this point. Based on the ending's trajectory, that may not be as straightforward for the story moving forward! Hoping the next seasons are released soon.

### Scrubs

Scrubs was one of those series I often caught on TV in the aughts but never really followed regularly. I was happy to find the entire series on Disney+ so that I could binge it and fill in the holes in my memory of the show.

I still had a fair idea of the characters and relationships involved. For some reason I always imagined that doctors John Dorian (Zach Braff) and Elliot Reid (Sarah Chalke) were a long-running couple on the show, but in truth they spent a little time being on-again off-again early on, then mostly apart until the 8th season when they got together for real. The main relationship the show consistently revolves around is actually between JD and Turk (Donald Faison), who have been best friends since they were young. Theirs is probably one of the most popular "bromances" on TV, and the rest of the cast of characters constantly dig on them for being closer than Turk is to his eventual wife Carla (Judy Reyes). 

My favorite character on this show probably remains the grumpy old mentor Dr Cox (John McGinley), who hides a caring heart under that rough exterior. And of course, there's the enigmatic janitor, who lives to torture JD and whose real name we only find out at the end of season 8 in his last appearance (or do we?). Besides that, Scrubs is great in that it has a wide cast of recurring one-note side characters, some of them with ridiculous names dreamed up by JD like Dr Beardface or Snoop Dogg Intern/Resident.

I did enjoy most of the run, it is fairly good background watching. We see JD and Turk and Eliot grow up from being dumb interns to fine doctors indeed, and by the end of season 8, they end the series with an imaginary future fantasy sequence from JD that would have served as a good endpoint for the series.

Sadly, the creators decided to do a season 9, with a whole new cast of interns and the original main cast in supporting and guest roles. It was fine I guess, but it did not do well in the ratings but was cancelled after one season. In my head, the season 8 finale remains the canon ending for Scrubs.

### Scott Pilgrim Takes Off

Another recent 8-episode Netflix release, I was mostly expecting Scott Pilgrim Takes Off to be simply an animated and more expanded retelling of the original comic book story (as opposed to the kind of compressed 2-hour Edgar Wright movie). I was therefore very surprised when the series took a sharp turn at the end of episode 1 and apparently kills off the main character Scott Pilgrim.

The rest of the run mostly consists of would-have-been girlfriend Ramona Flowers investigating Scott's apparent death, interviewing the other characters including her seven evil exes whose league has fallen apart. This gives us a more detailed exploration of Ramona and the exes' back stories than either the original comic or the movie ever provided.

I won't spoil where the story eventually leads, but suffice to say it is nowhere near what I expected. The animation is also nice with a sort of coarse feel that is somehow appropriate to the comic's original style. It also comes with a nice Japanese opening credits song by Necry Talkie.

### That's it for today

There's some other ongoings, but I might only finish them next year, so probably the next one of these posts will be in January? Live action Yu Yu Hakusho comes out this coming week!
