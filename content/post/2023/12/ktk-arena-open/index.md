title: Khans of Tarkir Arena Open
---

Magic Arena had a Khans of Tarkir limited Arena Open this weekend, and I wasted resources attempting to win the event, not just once, but TWICE!

For attempt #1, I initially started out with a B/G/W deck that swiftly went 0-2.

Then I was like "this is silly, I'm just going to run the stupid 4-color build I really wanted to run" and while getting the right mana mix was a challenge, it actually did better, netting me 3 wins in a row before succumbing to the fatal 3rd loss. I felt like I had figured out the format a bit. Incremental Growth was as good as I remembered it. Final record: 3-3.

At first I was like, I guess that was that, as I did not have any more currency to make another attempt. But then I was thinking it's the last open for the year, maybe I can just give Arena some money?!? And so I once again cracked open the credit card and spent $15 to have enough gems to play a second run. This brings my lifetime Arena spend to just below $70, which all in all is not too bad considering how much I play.

Okay, surely I would do better on the second run right? Spoiler: I did not.

The sealed pool looked okay, though not much better than the first one and the multicolor splashes seemed less reasonable so I stuck with Abzan colors again:

I started out 1-1 which would have been fine; the loss was due to mana drought so I still felt the deck was decent. In the middle of the 3rd game my two younger nephews showed up with their dad and I ended up splitting my attention between them and the game(s) I was playing. I am not blaming the kids for the subsequent loss(es), though it surely must have been a factor! But the fault was clearly mine, as after losing the 3rd game while quite distracted I went ahead and queued for another one anyway, all while helping the nephews with some [Transformers](/tags/transformers/). I lost the 4th game as well.

Final record: 1-3. 

Ah, life. I really should learn my lesson by now to just always stop at the one attempt. At least I got two fetches?!?s
