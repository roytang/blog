title: 'Books: Small Gods by Terry Pratchett (Discworld #13)'

Squeezing in one more book before the year ends! **Small Gods** is Discworld book 13, and this one covers the kingdom of Omnia somewhere in the desert near [Djelibeybi](/2023/06/pyramids/) I think. It satirises organized religion in general and a bit of philosophy as well and also gives us a look at how being a God works on the Discworld. As always I enjoyed Pratchett's writing; it's light and humorous and unafraid to hit even a heavy topic as gods and religion.

I like the character of Brutha; I always like the earnest, simple and direct sort of characters who somehow manage to rise above being manipulated by more cunning antagonists. And I found out that the character Vorbis in this book is the source for the name of the audio format popularly known as [Ogg Vorbis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vorbis) (although the Ogg part is not actually a reference to Discworld's Nanny Ogg).

A couple of quotes I highlighted:

> Fear is strange soil. Mainly it grows obedience like corn, which grows in rows and makes weeding easy. But sometimes it grows the potatoes of defiance, which flourish underground. 
> 

(I have [cited this one](/2017/01/10155269161388912/) before I even read the book!)

> Bishops move diagonally. That’s why they often turn up where the kings don’t expect them to be. 

This brings us to [19/41 Discworld](/topics/discworld/) books read! It's also the 4th Discworld book I read this year, so at that rate I will be done in 6 more years!
