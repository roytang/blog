**Sea of Stars** is an excellent retro-inspired RPG in the vein of SNES era classics like *Chrono Trigger*, with modern embellishments. 

First off: the game is gorgeous, featuring highly-detailed pixel art environments and sprites with many, many animations. Most of game has a very "cozy" feel and the lush environments will make you want to keep looking around and make sure there isn't treasure hidden somewhere nearby. There are of course also the requisite creepy dungeons and doom-bringing tentacle-clad enemies and such (also with detailed animations). There is a lot of attention to detail here, and the game features a lot of tiny little details like the start screen changing depending on the party members in your most recent save. 

Story-wise, it starts off in a pretty classic way, with a pair of youngsters fated to save their world from certain doom, but later it branches off into a story that involves parallel worlds and time travel and ageless immortals locked in endless conflict. The plot itself is super linear (which is fine, and is a fun contrast to the choice extravaganza that was [Baldur's Gate 3](/2023/12/bg3/)), though of course you will have the opportunity to travel around in search of secrets if you'd like.

There is a small amount of Zelda-like puzzle-solving during traversal, and you unlock some tools to help you with traversal. Which means there are some secrets you can only get while backtracking after getting those tools! But it's not a lot and the puzzles are never too hard (except maybe some of the endgame ones) so the game never really goes full Zelda.

Combat reminds me a lot of *Chrono Trigger* which is weird because it doesn't actually share many of the same systems with that game other than having Combo Attacks available depending on which party members are in your team. Combats also features timing-based systems, where you can press a button on getting hit to reduce damage or on hitting the opponent for bonus strikes, things like that. I first encountered that sort of thing in *Super Mario RPG* for the SNES and to be honest I didn't really like that kind of thing too much, but it was fine here in *Sea of Stars* for some reason, maybe because the timing windows aren't super strict?

The battles weren't too hard, though you could get wiped if you aren't paying too much attention, even in random encounters. Many of the boss battles provided interesting patterns, and the game's "locks" mechanic can even make some of them feel like puzzle-solving.

Regardless, if you find the combat system too challenging (though I suspect you won't), the game provides accessibility options in the form of "Relics" you can buy from the game's shops. Relics have different effects when activated such as fully healing your party after battles (I didn't enable this, felt too cheesy) or making it easier to hit those timing windows and there's even one that gives negative effects to give you more of a challenge.

The game also features a number of minigames: a fishing minigame that thankfully isn't too tedious, and also a boardgame called Wheels that you can play in the game's taverns. Wheels is interesting, but games take a bit too long to be a fun minigame you can just play on the side; I ended up leaving it until the end, Googling how to actualy play it, then finishing all the Wheels tables in a day. Oh, there's also a quiz minigame, which I obviously enjoyed. There is also a secret fourth minigame but it's actually a spoiler for the ending!

Overall the game was a great "comfort food" kind of game that is relaxing to play and you don't have to think about too hard and can just sit back and enjoy the story.

### Stats / Completion

{{% photos stats %}}

Play time: 45hrs, 43mins. 

Achievements: 41/42 (920/1000 gamerscore)

I am actually fairly happy with the achievement design with this game because even though it has you collecting every treasure in the game, nothing is ever really missable. The one achievement I did not do required an extra partial New Game+ run and I was actually game to try going for it, except that NG+ does not seem to let me skip cutscenes that I've already seen so it would have taken too much time.

HLTB says 41 hours for completionist, so I went a bit above average with this one, especially since I didn't bother with NG+.

### Screenshots!

I had to delete some of my captures because they were so spoilery!
