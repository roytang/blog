Minor spoilers here and there maybe.

### Rick and Morty S7

{{% photos rm-mail %}}

It's season 7, so by now we should all be aware of the kind of nonsense Rick and Morty brings us, but I still found a number of the eps enjoyable. The ep that stuck in my head the most was the "Fear Hole" episode, but that just might be receny bias. The continuing saga of Evil Morty and Rick Prime is always welcome (continuity), the spaghetti episode was quite disturbing for a spaghetti enjoyer like me, I enjoyed the random Total Recall and Taken references in "Wet Kuat Amortican Summer", the Numbericons sequel was silly fun, etc

I must note that in this season they replaced Justin Roiland the new VAs for Rick and Morty didn't miss, I did not feel like the voices are any different.

Also I realized this is the first time I'm actually reviewing a Rick and Morty season even though I've pretty much watched the show since the start. I generally find the show to be a fun romp and enjoy the continuity-heavy eps. It feels like a more insane version of Futurama maybe? I do understand there has been some toxicity problems with the show's fandom though, mostly among people who somehow idolize Rick's more idiotic leanings (kind of like the people who idolize Homelander for some reason?!?), but the show itself is fine.

### Wheel of Time S2

Was pleasantly surprised with how much they stuck with the plot of the second book given how much the first season diverged. The adaptation is still very loose of course, but they still managed to hit many of the major points like Lanfear and what happens to Egwene and the eventual get-together and showdown at Toman's Head. I was looking forward to Mat blowing the horn and enjoyed the scene, though the fact that most of the heroes of the horn weren't actually named makes me assume a certain character appearing in later books won't be in this adaptation. A number of things still happen ahead of schedule, pointing towards the eventual compression of the books the adaptation has to accept (it is very unlikely they are getting 14 seasons!). Though I am happy at a certain Aiel character being introduced early and her fight scenes were great! Rand easily winning the final confrontation at the end of the season seemed a bit much though.

Visuals, set pieces, effects, costuming, fight choreography, etc were all on point, and I enjoyed how the different regions of the world were portrayed.

It's so hard to avoid writing spoilers for this series, considering the books have been out for literal decades I think it's fine!

### Doctor Who 2023 Specials

I enjoyed all four of the 2023 Doctor Who specials and was happy to be re-introduced to Tennant's Doctor, as I had forgotten how manic he was and his interaction with Catherine Tate's Donna Noble was like they never stopped. My favorite episode of this set was probably The Wild Blue Yonder; it felt like a lot of the creepy Doctor Who mysteries I've seen before yet still had a number of silly bits to enjoy. NPH's performance as the Toymaker felt a bit over-the-top but that's pretty much expected of him I suppose. The weird regeneration into Ncuti Gatwa was a not unpleasant surprise and perhaps an indication of the kinds of nonsense RTD intends to bring us to in 2023. Not yet sold on Ruby Sunday as a companion though, maybe she'll grow on me.

* I needed [a Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIkn4-bG5Hk) to tell me how Ncuti's name is pronounced.

Previously: [Doctor Who 2022 Specials](/2022/12/movies-tv-2022/#doctor-who-2022-specials), [Doctor Who Flux (series 13)](/2021/12/2c719acc6b88173b3abe47cc18a632c0/). Oh, I hadn't written about the pre-2022 Nuwho series before! A while back I started compiling a spreadsheet giving per-episode ratings as I rewatched Smith's run, it might be worth doing that for all of Nuwho at some point.

### Spy X Family Season 2

{{% photos spyx %}}

Still more of the same; the show remains a fun and light watch, making it easily bingeable and even still works as background watching despite the need for subtitle. A pleasant surprise for me this season was an extended story arc involving Yor's extracurricular activities and we see more of her in action as an assassin; after season 1 I was a bit worried that the show would be one-sided and only focus on Lloyd's spy missions. 

I had started [reading the manga](/2023/07/2023-manga-update/#spy-x-family) after watching season 1 and as of season 2 it has not yet caught up. I think if/when the anime catches up to where I started with the manga, I might drop the show entirely as I believe the show sticks closely to the manga anyway, and I prefer reading over watching when possible.

### That's It

Those are my last TV reviews of the year! Still have some unfinished stuff but those will be reviewed next year I suppose.
