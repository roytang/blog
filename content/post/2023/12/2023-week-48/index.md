title: 2023 Week 48
---

It is now week 48 of 2023, it is December and advent season has begun.

### The World

Someone some people used to consider a very smart man told his biggest customers to fuck off. An infamous war criminal has passed away at age 100. A popular local love team has broken up. 

### My Week

Yet another busy week, especially towards the end, even though one of our scheduled happenings didn't push through. Going anywhere inside the Metro this close to Christmas is always a challenge, given the increased traffic levels.

A lot of this week's errands revolved around trying to getting some applications for financial medical assistance for a family member through goverment bureaucracy. It's not yet done! Writing more details about all the processes might turn out useful for other people, but for privacy reasons I'd rather not do it while the current medical problems are still unresolved, so it may be a while.

I think my last surviving external hard drives has died, Windows has stopped recognizing it. I think this one was only 3 years old! I have to find a better (longer-lasting) backup solution (in addition to the cloud), as I'm tired of having to replace external hard drives every few years.

It's December, so Spotify Wrapped is out, though [mine is unusual this year](/2023/12/111509729930849977/).

Trivia team attended [the final quiz night for the year](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-bang), but we only placed second! I'm thinking of adding a quiz night section to my [stats page](/page/stats/live/) because why not?!?

On the blog: I wrote about [my everday carry](/2023/11/everyday-carry/). 

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I swear I am actually making progress on both **Sea of Stars** and **Baldur's Gate 3**. I may even finish one of them this year! Hopefully both!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. The Lost Caverns of Ixalan continue to be terrible for me.

- **Reading**: I have finished reading all the mainline Daredevil volumes and ended up writing [a 3,000-word entry](/2023/11/cmr-daredevil/) to the [complete-marvel-run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) series. Really want to read another actual book or two before year end though.

- **Watching**: Watched [Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny (2023)](/2023/12/movies-sep-dec-2023/#indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-2023) since it was finally out on Disney+. Keeping up with a bunch of series; apparently **Invincible** isn't resuming until next year though. Wanna try to get through some more shorter series on my to-watch list so I can have more material for a reviews post.

### Walking

Managed to hit 70,276 steps this week, once again hitting my weekly target! No notes.

Where previously I would eagerly attend every company-wide meeting to learn what was happening, I found myself now able to predict the answers executives would give word for word."

### Site Changes

- Still cleaning up old content on the site; it's a secret to everybody.
- Minor fixes, nothing big.
  
### Things I've been thinking about

Feeling tired and overwhelmed, financial issues, maybe picking up work again, coins, bacteria, missed opportunities, what-might-have-beens, content organization, all the things I still want to get done before year end

### Things I'm looking forward to

Huh, nothing specific planned out. No new releases to look forward to? Apparently not.
