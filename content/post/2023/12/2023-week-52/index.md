title: 2023 Week 52 Happy New Year!
---

The wheel turns, and we say goodbye to 2023 later.

### My Week

It has been a week. As expected, family get-togethers occupied the early part of the week. On Christmas Eve we hosted my brothers and all the grandchildren here of course; it's always fun when all the kids around, though as niece #2 exclaimed "IT'S SO CHAOTIC!!". On Christmas Day itself, it was an out-of-town road trip to see some cousins and other relatives we hadn't seen before the pandemic. There was another party here for the parents and their friends Friday night as well. As you'd expect, we've been eating a lot of leftover food the rest of the days of the week.

I was given [a gaming chair](/2023/12/111647299570441458/)!

On the blog: I wrote about [Being Mortal](/2023/12/being-mortal/). And earlier today I posted [an archive of my New Year's Eve jokes and comments](/2023/12/nye-jokes/).

I have also started collating some data for my year-end wrap up posts coming next week and prepping for a bunch of other year-end tasks.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Hey, nothing this week! Light gaming week!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.

- **Reading**: Managed to finish one final book this week, a Discworld one: [Small Gods by Terry Pratchett](/2023/12/small-gods/). Still reading a bunch of comics!

- **Watching**: Wrote [some more TV reviews](/2023/12/tv-rich-morty-wheel-of-time-doctor-who-spy-x/). Finished watching What If season 2. In the middle of Live Action Yu Yu Hakusho. Watched some movies! [They Cloned Tyrone (2023)](/2023/12/they-cloned-tyrone-2023/), [The Creator (2023)](/2023/12/the-creator-2023/), [The Fast and the Furious (2001)](/2023/12/the-fast-and-the-furious-2001/).

### Walking

We are still on a suspended walking hiatus, but I still manage 40,046 steps for the past week, a bit more than the previous week. I expect to be a bit busy again today, so I decided to extend the hiatus to include today. Ten thousand steps daily quota resumes on the 1st of January!

### Some Links of Interest

- [Pluralistic: 2024’s public domain is a banger (20 Dec 2023) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/20/em-oh-you-ess-ee/): Looking forward to the Mouse's "Blood and Honey"

- [They Want You To Forget What A Film Looks Like - Aftermath](https://aftermath.site/true-lies-4k-uhd-blu-ray-james-cameron-peter-jackson-park-road-post): I am not very good at discerning small visual details, so a lot of the criticisms here of new AI-upscaled versions of old films would have probably been lost on me

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

Additionally, I had a whole bunch of links in the backlog so I decided to skip the link blog and post [a 2023 End of Year Linkdump](/2023/12/2023-linkdump/)!

### Site Changes

- Still cleaning up old content on the site.
- Some minor CSS tweaks, backend fixes, etc. 
- There is a new section that is already deployed to the site, but is still incomplete, so I won't link to it from anywhere yet.

### Things I've been thinking about

The past year, and the year to come. 

### Looking Forward To

Writing my end of year posts! Coming this week!

If you are enjoying the trivia bot over on Mastodon, [the scores will be reset tonight](https://botsin.space/@triviastorm/111599770373450253)!

### Sign-off

That's a wrap on 2023! (More or less, barring any shenanigans this evening!) I hope you had a good year, and hopefully we all have an even better 2024.
