I normally share links via [the link blog](/links/), but I have a HUGE backlog of links to share that I haven't put on the link blog for some reason or another, so I'm going to dump a while bunch of them here in the hopes of cutting down into that backlog. I don't really like doing huge link dumps like this with a variety of different topics because honestly I could just break this list down into multiple blog posts and have them be properly tagged and all, but here we are.

### Internet/Blogging

- [The internet used to be ✨fun✨](https://projects.kwon.nyc/internet-is-fun/)
- [You should have a website](https://maerk.xyz/blog/you-should-have-a-website/):

    > Think of the people you actually give a shit about in real life. They would like your website, and you would like their websites.

- [Websites that spark joy](https://whimsical.club/)
- [The Birth and Death of the Yesterweb Forum Reveal Two Important Truths](https://cheapskatesguide.org/articles/yesterweb.html)
- [More Thoughtful Reading & Writing on the Web](https://tantek.com/2023/277/b1/thoughtful-reading-writing-web) 
- ["My product is my garden"](https://herman.bearblog.dev/my-product-is-my-garden/):

    > That’s what I want from my products. I want to putter about, feel connected to the process, and have fun doing so. I want to make things that don’t scale. To see people tuck into them and enjoy them as people, not as stats.

- [Paul Millerd on Sabbaticals](https://twitter.com/p_millerd/status/1684184369034936320) (quoted here in full because Twitter):

    > people that make high income and high savings should take sabbaticals as soon as possible.  
    > 
    > Many of these people are convinced that early “retirement” is only possible at extremely high $$ levels.  I think it’s an error of what life is about. 
    > 
    > Often the projections of needing a lot of money are a byproduct of setting up your life in a certain way around an job that you aren’t totally excited about. 
    > 
    > This leads to all sorts of misery spending that people think is what they want but is really sort of manufactured goals (because you need some reason why you’d > do this) 
    > 
    > A sabbatical let’s you sample time freedom and see that you may need less than you think.  In a sense it takes the edge off of feeling stressed and anxious.  
    > 
    > I think that people also underestimate how many hidden interests and preferences they may have for spending time.

### Games/Puzzles

- [Moderator Mayhem](https://moderatormayhem.engine.is/): A Content Management game. I haven't tried this myself out of fear of psychic damage.
- [Metazooa](https://metazooa.com/): Animal guessing game. You'll do better if you're really into animal taxonomy
- [Conlextions by Lex Friedman](https://lexfriedman.com/connections/): For when the one daily NYT Connections just isn't enough
- [Cuboid by Thomas Friday](https://www.thomasfriday.com/cuboid/): Simple puzzle game. He has a couple of other games linked on the main page of his site.
- [Forgeous](https://forgeous.fun/): Finger painting fine art forgeries. Best tried on mobile.
- [Different strokes](https://swsteffes.itch.io/different-strokes): Explore a virtual art gallery and fix the paintings or create new ones

### Tools/Apps/Utility Websites

- [City Roads](https://anvaka.github.io/city-roads/): This website renders every single road within a city. The generated images seem nice. I added the one for my city to my wallpaper rotation:

    {{% photos Quezon %}}

- [Markwhen](https://markwhen.com/): Offline-first, plain text calendar and planning app. I haven't found occasion to use it yet, but it seems neat.
- [NewPipe](https://newpipe.net/): Alternative mobile front-end for Youtube and other video services. Requires installing an APK, it's not on the Google Play store for obvious reasons. Haven't used it a lot, doesn't seem to support YT accounts (so I can't get my recommendations/subs), but I like the idea.
- [WordStream Maker](https://huyen-nguyen.github.io/maker/index.html): Visualization for topic evolution. Seems like a neat idea, but running it uses up a lot of browser resources.
- [HueMint](https://huemint.com): Uses "machine learning" to generate color schemes for graphic design, including where to place them in layous, etc. I don't think it's an LLM thing, as I think I saved this link in 2021. I'm always interested in things like this because visual design is not my strong point and tools like this can fill in the gap.
- [YakRead](https://yakread.com/): "Get a selection of long-tail essays, blog posts, and newsletters in your inbox daily. Curated with love and AI." I might find this useful if I ever actually stop finding interesting things to read myself and clear my own backlog.
- [Smooth Shadow generator](https://smoothshadows.com/): Tool to generate CSS or Figma layers to generate shadow effects
- [90's Cursor Effects](https://tholman.com/cursor-effects/): I wouldn't use any of these, but they bring back memories
- [Wayback Machine Archiver](https://github.com/agude/wayback-machine-archiver): Archive web pages to the wayback machine via command line
- [Leave Only the Questions](https://only-the-questions.glitch.me/). Related: [The power of seeing only the questions in a piece of writing](https://uxdesign.cc/the-power-of-seeing-only-the-questions-in-a-piece-of-writing-8f486d2c6d7d)

### GameDev/Game Design

- [Old World Designer Notes](https://www.metafilter.com/194953/Old-World-Designer-Notes): The link is to a MeFi post that acts as an index into Sorenson's notes on designing [The Old World](https://mohawkgames.com/oldworld/).
- ["It really is a great feat ... that any of the games ... worked at all"](https://www.metafilter.com/191803/It-really-is-a-great-feat-that-any-of-the-games-worked-at-all): MeFi again, with context for [a Youtube video about Racing the Beam on the Atari 2600](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJFnWZH5FXc)
- [Meet Reiner Knizia: The man who’s designed over 700 board games](https://www.euronews.com/culture/2023/12/03/meet-reiner-knizia-the-man-whos-designed-over-700-board-games)

- [Writing effectively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtIzMaLkCaM): I've only seen clips of this, I keep telling myself to watch the full video, but it's like an hour and a half long
- [Playlist: Behind the Scenes of Animation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY6Bdqw37-9sFQcnV6zwEsZsJ8VxM76Eo) via [Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com/2023/05/behind-the-scenes-animation-playlist/)
- [Designing Logic Puzzles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-MPAC6-lbk): I think I saved this one when I was thinking of doing a puzzle game for a game jam

- [The 1970s Filipino Comics "Invasion"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAYeYCMZUck)

### Ambience/Mood

### There's still a lot more

I used to save my links in Google Keep and the archive was getting unwieldy and most of the above links were from there, but even with all of the above I think I only cut down the backlog by around half! Hopefully I can share most of them next year!
