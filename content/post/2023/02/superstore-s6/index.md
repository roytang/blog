This series came out on NF recently and I was reminded that I never watched the final season so I binged that in the background over a couple of days. Season is relatively short (15 eps) and I guess generally of the same quality as the previous ones. Mostly watched this one just to get some closure. A few laughs here and there, most plotlines resolved satisfactorily. The best thing about this show was the relatively large ensemble cast (since a big box store requires a lot of staff), so they rarely run out of B-plots to run.
