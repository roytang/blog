title: Managing Your Workload
---

While digging through some old work chat logs (from 2011, more than 10 years ago!), I found some interesting advice I was giving to some junior developers in our company about how to handle and prioritize the increasing workload (number of tasks) they were being given. I thought it might be worth sharing. The below are all messages from me, extracted from the chat logs, with a light touch of translation for those parts *in italics*, since like most informal discussions at offices here, a lot of it was in *Taglish*.

<time>03:12:17</time> I was discussing with someone the other day

<time>03:12:29</time> the problem of being *"capable"*

<time>03:12:42</time> *it's like when you're capable*... the tendency is to give you the more difficult tasks

<time>03:12:46</time> or to give you more tasks

<time>03:12:49</time> *because you're capable*

<time>03:12:56</time> then *your output is still good*

<time>03:13:05</time> so you get even more tasks or more difficult ones

<time>03:13:07</time> and so on

<time>03:13:15</time> until you get to the point of burnout

<time>03:13:18</time> or incompetence

<time>03:13:32</time> yeah

<time>03:13:42</time> anyway, *the reason our burnout rate is high*

<time>03:13:59</time> *we have a high level of being "capable" here*, on average

<time>03:14:19</time> law on promotions -> you get promoted to your level of incompetence

<time>03:15:06</time> ["the price for being the best is always having to be the best"](/collections/quotes/56767445/)

<time>03:16:23</time> at some point, you have to decide for yourself *what your limit is* i guess

<time>03:16:36</time> *what is a good equilibrium for you*

<time>03:17:06</time> it isnt immediately obvious *kasi* that you have to manage your tasks *also*

<time>03:17:12</time> some people are like *keep 'em coming*

<time>03:17:36</time> i complain all the time

<time>03:17:59</time> i dont mind having a lot of tasks, but i'm not going to promise *that I can do them all* on time lol

<time>03:18:27</time> *sometimes if I'm asked "can you still take this up?" i'll answer "let's try it, then i'll raise if i can't handle it"*

<time>03:18:39</time> i'm not going to say "yes" if the answer is "i'm not sure"

<time>03:18:43</time> *we just do* try-catch

<time>03:19:04</time> when everything is urgent...

<time>03:19:34</time> *if you have a lot of tasks, and all of them are urgent or high prio, you can make a list*

<time>03:19:52</time> then everytime *a new thing comes in*, refer to the list and ask *where it should be on that* priority list

<time>03:20:20</time> you have to communicate *that there's a* cost everytime some new thing comes in

<time>03:21:14</time> yeah, *it's hard to talk about* priorities in isolation

<time>03:21:20</time> *it should really be* compared to other tasks

<time>03:21:36</time> *if they can't prioritize, that means it's up to me*, even better!

<time>03:21:44</time> *i'll treat as low pri the ones I don't want to do* lol

There was a follow-up comment later about how my advice was difficult to pursue because I was speaking from a position of seniority where other people were more likely to give credence to what I say, while junior developers might not have that privilege. I replied that I've been that way since I was a newbie developer, that I'm always complaining if the workload is too much. I think the main issue is that junior developers don't always feel that they have a choice in the matter, that they can push back. And while that may or may not be true, looking for a new job/position that actually respects your inputs and your limits should always be a choice that you should at least consider.
