title: 2023 Week 07
---

This past week was exhausting. Lots of going out for me: some bank errands I've long been putting off, the return of quiz nights, movie watchings, meeting up with old friends. Lots of walking too.

I've started taking the shorter walks without my phone, which is helpful for thinking while walking (less distractions), but also gives me a bit of anxiety because most of the time that means I'm walking around without any ID or means of contact in case of emergency. Which is kind of a very modern-day problem to have, isn't it?

I did start picking up an old gamedev project again and worked on some improvements I wanted to get in and am kind of hoping it would feel good enough to release/sell on itch.io maybe? We shall see, but it may take a while.

After a long while, the Geekfight face-to-face quiz nights are back! [We attended last Wednesday, but didn't do so well](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-hobby-stadium).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing **Witcher 3** (running around searching for treasure, trying to save a bard), but also finished [Ori and the Will of the Wisps](/2023/02/ori2/)!
    - Online: Did some more drafts of [All Will Be One](/tags/mtgone/) on **Magic Arena**. **Eternal**, **Marvel Snap** still ongoing. 

- **Books**: Haven't started any new ones yet.

- **Movies**: Watched [Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-2023)

- **TV**: Still watching The Blacklist, already halfway through S3! *Star Trek Picard* has already started though, might want to get into that.

### Photos I Have Taken

I always take photos of signs I see that have the grammar slightly off. This was one was from a mall, which is even more disappointing:

I had to walk down Hemady street to get to this week's quiz night; it's a bit creepy walking there at night because there are very few people. There are however these bronze statues that are there for some reason:

The first statue I noticed was a small one that I initially thought was a child hiding in the dark among some bushes alone at night maybe waiting for his parents. Kinda creepy!

    > The Fediverse apps are all built on a set of rules called the ActivityPub standard, which is a little like HTML had sex with a calendar invite. It’s a content polycule. The questions it evokes are the same as with any polycule: What are the rules? How big can this get?

### This coming week

This Wednesday is Ash Wednesday. A couple of birthdays in the family this week as well.

Friday is the anniversary of the EDSA revolution, looking forward to our current President's remarks!

Kind of just want to relax this week.
