Quick review: This was a great Metroidvania, I think practically all aspects have been improved over the original, the exploration is fun, the boss fights are pretty good, and the visuals are very pretty. I always tell people that while [Hollow Knight](/2019/02/hollow-knight/) has better combat, Ori has better platforming, and this game has excellent platforming. Ori controls really well, especially in midair and all the new moves mean you can do a lot of cool sequences without ever touching the ground. 

Also, for some reason I got waaaay less deaths in this game compared to [the original](/2017/07/883358595701628930/) (111 vs 900+ WTH). I suspect it's because there's a lot less "instant kill" type obstacles in this game compared to the first one.

Completion: I'm finishing at 30/37 achievements. Much like the original, I will not be doing achievement completion here, although I did go out of my way to get all collectibles and hit 100% "completion". The missing achievements are silly things like "beat the game without dying" or "beat the game under 4 hours". I enjoyed the game, but not enough to do additional runs for things like that.

Total playtime: Around 20h (which is way more than the HLTB average of 15.5 hours!)

Edit: Here's me playing through the first parts of the game:
