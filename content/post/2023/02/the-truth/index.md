**The Truth** is Discworld book 25. Finished reading this last night! I bought this back in 2019, and it's the last physical Discworld book I have that I hadn't read yet.

It was a fun read about the establishment of the free press in Ankh-Morpork, coinciding with a conspiracy to oust the city's leadership. Plays out as a sort of crime/mystery thriller, except told from the PoV of an accidental investigative journalist. While this isn't actually one of the City Watch books (my favorite Discworld subseries), many of the City Watch do appear as supporting cast. And it's a bit refreshing to have a mystery unfolding and being solved from someone else's PoV! The satire is spot-on as usual, as is the obvious commentary about made-up tabloid news being more popular than political issues, something just as relevant today as when the book came out in 2000. 

A good, light-hearted start to my reading year. This brings us to 16/41 Discworld books read!
