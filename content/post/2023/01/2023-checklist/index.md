title: 'New Year''s Checklist 2023: Things I''m Looking Forward To'
toc: true
---

Something I've gotten used to as the New Year rolls in: make a checklist of things to do and things I'm looking forward to for the new year. This one is coming in a bit late due to some business. This is my personal list, but maybe you'll enjoy going through it too. I generally copy stuff over, but the list changes a bit every year. Check out the [new-years-checklist tag](/tags/new-years-checklist/) for previous years.

### New year reminders

These are general reminders that I think anyone would find useful

- Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful
- Change your passwords
- Throw away a few things you no longer need
- Audit your financials -- where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc
    - Review your recurring luxury costs (Netflix, etc) and evaluate whether you still really need them
- Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that's gathered there over the past year
- Choose something from the past year that you're going to stop watching or doing
- Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great
- Replace 2022 calendars
- Digital housekeeping
    - Delete all files downloaded 2020 or earlier
    - Clean up the photos on your phone, tablet and computer
    - Backup all important content
    - Export your data from platforms like Google, FB, Instagram and Twitter
- Follow up on the people who owe you money or things
- Forgive those who have wronged you
- Speak truth to power.
- Be kind
- Relax, give yourself room to breathe and grow.
- Buy a new toothbrush

### My specific goals

- Site redesign. I'm a bit unhappy with the site's current layout and presentation. I was hoping I could whip up a quick redesign late last year, but alas. 
- Migrate [the twitter triviabot](https://twitter.com/triviastorm) to Mastodon. Same as above, wanted to get this done last year, but alas. Maybe listing these "should have beens" in this list will help make things happen [[DONE]](/2023/02/triviastorm-mastodon/)
- General room cleaning
- Complete the backups review
- Cash out at an Arena or Eternal open
- Participate in Ludum Dare 52 (Jan 07) [[DONE]](/2023/01/ludum-dare-52-shooty-2/)
- Participate in Ludum Dare 53 (Apr 28) [[SKIPPED]](/2023/04/3eadcd965f50bf77050d504402a31667/)
- Participate in Ludum Dare 54 (Sep 29)
- Travel to Singapore (Mar) - tickets are already booked, this will be my first international trip since the pandemic started! [[DONE]](/2023/03/sgtrip2023/)

### Entertainment

#### Games

New releases I'm looking forward to:

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- --> |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| May 12 | Legends of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom [[DONE]](/2023/07/totk/) | Switch |
| Jun 02 | Street Fighter 6 | PC |
| Jun 22 | Final Fantasy XVI | PS5, but will probably play on PC, expected around 6mo after PS5 release |

I would guess I am likely to get TotK and SF6 at launch and FF16 probably pushed into next year.

Older releases I want to play:

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Tales of Xillia 2 | PS3 | RPG | carried over from last year's list |
| Citizen Sleeper | PC Game Pass | RPG/Adventure | [[DONE]](/2023/01/citizen-sleeper/) |
| Ori and the Will of the Wisps | PC Game Pass | Metroidvania | [[DONE]](/2023/02/ori2/) |
| Pentiment | PC Game Pass | Story-driven | |
| Return to Monkey Island | PC Game Pass | Story-driven | [[DONE]](/2023/04/return-to-monkey-island/) |
| Crusader Kings III | Steam | Grand strategy | |
| The Witcher 3: GOTY | Steam | RPG | |
| Wasteland 3 | Steam | RPG | |

The last 3 are games I already own on Steam and have been wanting to get into. Subscribing to PC Game Pass lets me add a lot of smaller games to my to-play list as well. There's 3 RPGs here in addition to the new releases above, so good luck finding the time for all of these.

#### TV

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|
| TBA | What If S2 |
| TBA | Secret Invasion |
| TBA | Echo |
| TBA | Loki S2 |
| TBA | Ironheart |
| TBA | Agatha Coven of Chaos |

Rumor has it about half of the MCU shows will be pushed off to next year, which is fine because honestly I have a lot of backlog I want to watch. 

#### Movies

From last year's list of 20 items, I watched 11, have not yet seen 4, 4 got postponed to 2023, and 1 was cancelled completely (RIP Batgirl film). 

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- --> |

| Jun 09 | Transformers: Rise of the Beasts | |
| Jun 16 | The Flash | [[DONE]](/2023/06/the-flash-2023/) |
| Jun 30 | Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny | |
| Jul 14 | Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One | [[DONE]](/2023/07/mission-impossible-dead-reckoning-part-one-2023/) |
| Jul 21 | Oppenheimer | I haven't even seen Tenet yet |
| Aug 18 | Blue Beetle | |
| Sep 15 | A Haunting in Venice | Poirot |
| Oct 06 | Kraven the Hunter | Same expectations as Morbius! |
| Nov 03 | Dune: Part Two | |
| Nov 10 | The Marvels | |
| Dec 25 | Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom | |

We'll see how many of these release dates hold! Also, it's unlikely I'm watching all of these in the cinema, since ticket prices have gotten so expensive lately.

### Others

As mentioned in [the last post](/2023/01/2022-year-in-review/), I am considering picking up new part-time/full-time work again, but no concrete plans yet.

It kind of feels like I should set some more ambitious 2023 goals, but I guess that's not really where I am right now?
