**That 90s Show** dropped on Netflix this past week, I already finished the season. I think they did a good job nailing the general mood of the show and the 90s aesthetic, though it feels a bit like it's trying too hard at some points. The compressed season length doesn't give the characters much space to developer, so compared to the original show, everything feels a bit rushed or crammed in. 

Let's face it, we're all here for the cameos from the original show anyway. It was weird seeing Wilder Valderama be Fez again when I've been watching him be all serious in NCIS. Out of all the returning cameos, Laura Prepon is the one who looks the most different from when she was on the original show. Topher Grace looks like he never left!
