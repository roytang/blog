title: Walking Distances

I walk a lot. A couple of days ago I was thinking about how I'd been a walking a lot even when I was young. Since I now have Google Maps, I can check the distances of the routes I used to walk!

### High School

Google Maps tells me my high school is around 3.7km away from where we lived back then. I am sure I walked that whole distance at least once, but not often. What I did do fairly regularly was walk down Agham Road and BIR road to [my favorite spot on East Avenue](/2014/02/corner/), which should be around half that distance, so probably a 15-20 minute walk. The commute home from that spot was easier - 1 jeepney ride vs at least a jeepney and a bus ride + maybe a 1km walk. The downside being walking that route takes me past some shady squatters' areas, so I'd prefer not to do it after dark.

### College

College was a slightly closer to home. The Palma Hall Annex at the University (where I hung out a lot during the first couple of years) was roughly 3.3km from our house. I walked that entire distance at least once - and it was because there was a tropical storm going on and I didn't have any other easy way to get transportation. I would often walk that route at least partway through though, especially in the later years. 

*(I had the option of taking a tricycle through the same route to get to and from the University, but I seldom availed that route because it was a lot more expensive than the regular 2 jeepney rides from Philcoa. Well, at least until the later years when I got lazier, as the tricycle route was much more convenient.)*

It was also a regular occurrence during the college years that I'd have a class at the College of Engineering followed by a class at the Math Building, roughly a 10-15 minute walk, which was more or less the window you got between periods. Most people would instead take an Ikot/Toki jeep, but between waiting for the jeep and the roundabout route, it takes around the same time, so I often preferred just walking.

Another distance I regularly walked during those years would be the length of University Ave down to Philcoa. This was roughly a 1.8km walk from the College of Engineering. Often I would be walking an additional 0.5km or so into Teachers' Village to hang out at a friend's house in that area. (And later take a tricycle home).

Students from the University are so used to walking, it's not uncommon to joke that the term "walking distance" means something else coming from us (via [readysethrun](https://twitter.com/readysethrun/statuses/1150758504854016001/)):

Many years after college [I still enjoy walking around the University](/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/), though I seldom get to do it. 

### Interlude

While digging through some old files looking for something relevant to this post (see below), I found an old essay I had written about going out on late night walks. I believe I haven't posted in anywhere online before, so [I'm putting it up on this site](/2002/12/quietnight/), backdated to a rough guess of when I wrote it. I think that these days, going out for a walk at the hour described in that post is not so remarkable for me anymore.

### Ortigas

After graduation, [my first job](/2023/01/twenty-years-working/) was at a company in Ortigas. When I started out, I would often be walking from the Ortigas MRT station to our office building, back and forth, roughly a 1.3km distance.

I didn't have a pedometer then (this was before smartphones or smart watches), but I do remember manually counting the steps as I walked at some point! In fact, I found an old file that had some notes, probably from 2005:

> Walking Distances
> 
> * Shaw MRT Station to Tektite: ~1500 steps
> * Pacific bldg to Tektite: ~400 steps
> * Tektite to Megamall (Superbowl at Megastrip): ~800 steps
> * My seat to CR, and back: ~200steps
> 

*(Tektite is our office building)*

As the years went on, [Metro Manila's traffic situation became worse and worse](/2019/10/this-is-metro-manila/), and the commute becamse much worse as well. Every so often, this resulted in me having to walk longer distances such as [from Cubao to Robinson's Galleria](/2014/08/10153129667243912/), a roughly 4.7km distance.

The total walking distance from the office to our house was roughly 14km. It would be an insane idea to try to walk that entire distance, which I estimate would have taken me somewhere between 2.5 to 3hrs. I did attempt it a few times but I almost always gave up less than a third of the way through.

### More Recently

After quitting my Ortigas job and going freelance, I had more time for walking longer distances regularly. I tried tracking my step counts using smartphone apps like a Samsung app (forget the name) and Google Fit, but those seemed horribly inaccurate. For a while, I also carried around a 3DS all the time, which also tracks my steps, but the problem with the 3DS is that AFAIK the data there is not exportable. I hope to someday export my data from these past sources and make a stats page somewhere.

These days I use [a Fitbit Charge 2](/2018/11/fitbit/), which I've had since 2017! It has lasted a surprisingly long while, although it's pretty close to dying. The display stopped working late last year, but I still use it (it still syncs my step counts to the app).

*(My Fitbit goal is currently set to 8k steps per day. I used to have the apocryphal 10k daily target, but I find it a bit too stressful to try to hit that target everyday, it takes so much time, so I set it to the slightly lower target. Whenever I hit that target while I'm out walking, I throw my fists in the air in a silent celebration; it feels great.)*

I stopped the daily walks for a while when the pandemic hit. Tried resuming in 2021, but then we got hit by Covid in late 2021 and I was told to take it easy for a while after, so I kept my step counts low for a few months after. Been trying to ramp back up my daily walking since then, and by the end of 2022, I'm back up to a bit more than 8k steps per day, roughly 6-7km total per day. I'm hoping to gradually push that average higher this year, perhaps up to 10k steps per day.
