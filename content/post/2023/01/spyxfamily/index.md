**Spy X Family**: Been watching this for a few weeks now. Slowed down a bit because Netflix lost the English dubs in the second half of the season. The show is surprisingly funny given it's premise. Anya being secretly a telepath but also being an idiot provides for a hilarious POV and is a good contrast to Loid's hypercompetent and always serious superspy persona. Yor is a bit underdeveloped as a character, but I guess it's early still. Even the side characters which I initially thought would be annoying end up having hilarious motivations. I enjoyed the season enough that I started reading the manga on the Shonen Jump app, although that jumps me some 40 issues ahead I think, but I guess that's fine?!?

The [wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spy_%C3%97_Family) says the "X" in the title is silent, but I'll just keep pronouncing it the way I've been pronouncing "Hunter X Hunter" all these years.
