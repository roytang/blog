title: Twenty Years As A Software Developer
---

Today is the twentieth anniversary of my first day at my first job, which means I have officially been a software developer for twenty years.

Feels like it should be the kind of momentous occasion about which I'd have some words I'd like to say, but this one kind of snuck up on me so I don't have anything right now. Maybe at the 25th year?
