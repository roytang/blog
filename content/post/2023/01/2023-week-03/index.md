title: '2023 Week 03: Lunar New Year'
---

This past weekend was the Lunar New Year, [which is only for people who live in countries that have a moon](https://twitter.com/itsamia/status/1616059773132103680). Someone told me recently that the term "Chinese New Year" is outdated and kind of racist, so the preferred term nowadays is "Lunar New Year". That's fine I guess? I don't think Filipinos are likely to change their wording regarding this anyway. 

I'm also easily confused nowadays because when I was young the greeting was always "Kung Hei Fat Choy", but these days there are a lot of variants. As shared by my mom from an unknown source:

> Just in case you’re confused: 
> 
> “Kung Hei Fat Choi!” (Cantonese)
> 
> “Gong Xi Fa Cai!” (Mandarin)
> 
> “Kiong Hee Huat Tsai!” (Hokkien)
> 
> “Uy! Penge tikoy!” (Pinoy) 
>

The weather is starting to get hotter in the middle of the day, which makes me worry that the pleasant days of January are nearing their end.

My week was mostly family medical errands, which meant a lot of waiting around for doctors to arrive or to get blood drawn and such. A bit more of these this coming week, then we should be good for the next few months I think?

### Media Diet

- Mostly TV stuff this week. Watched [That 90s Show](/2023/01/that90sshow/) and finished [Spy X Family season 1](/2023/01/spyxfamily/). Since I now have access to the entire **Simpsons** back catalog via Disney+, I started watching older season episodes (starting with season 3) on the side while doing other stuff. It's perfect background watching because I've seen all these episodes before yet the plots are usually good enough to get a chuckle out of me. Also been catching up on **NCIS** via Disney+ as well, which meant I watched their NCIS-verse crossover (what, no JAG?), which meant I had to watch one episode each of the spin-off shows NCIS Hawaii and NCIS:LA, just in time for NCIS:LA to get cancelled apparently.

- I did start reading **The Truth** (Discworld #25) while I was waiting at a doctor's clinic, so at least I've started the year's reading already.

### Some Links

I have managed to tear through my feed reader backlogs and have harvested some links for sharing:

- [Matt Yglesias and the secret of blogging - by Max Read](https://maxread.substack.com/p/matt-yglesias-and-the-secret-of-blogging): 

    > As Yglesias says, it's the best time there’s ever been to be somebody who can write something coherent quickly. Put things out. Let people yell at you. Write again the next day.

- [Twitter officially bans third-party clients with new developer rules - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/19/23562947/twitter-third-party-client-tweetbot-twitterific-ban-rules): Not only is this bait-and-switch justification idiotic, but it reinforces my view that Tweetdeck dying is an inevitability.  The only chance Tweetdeck had was that it's left alone because only power users used it, but that's true of third-party clients as well. As soon as EM finds out he actually owns a (better) alternative web client that doesn't serve ads, it's over for Tweetdeck. This annoyed me so much that [I unfollowed 95% of my Twitter follows](/2023/01/1614912728325578752/).

- [Fan Sites VS Fandom: A Case Study | Brain Baking](https://brainbaking.com/post/2023/01/fan-sites-vs-fandom-a-case-study/): Sharing because people should make more unique personal fan sites again and not just rely on platforms like Fandom

- [Pluralistic: Why the Fed wants to crush workers (19 Jan 2023) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2023/01/19/creditors-vs-workers/): I've not always been clear on how inflation, interest rates, unemployment etc affect the moving parts of the economy at the macro level. Doctorow's post here seems like a good primer, even if you're not in the US

### This coming week

The [LD52 game jam](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/52) rating period ends on Friday, hoping for a good outcome!
