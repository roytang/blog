title: My Brothers War Limited Recap
dontinlinephotos: true
---

New set is coming up in a couple of weeks, I figured I should do the **Brothers War** limited recap already to get it out of the way. It isn't even two months since I published [the Dominaria United one](/2022/12/mtgdmu-limited-recap/)!

### Set Notes:

- Brothers War limited was not great for me, as reflected in the below-average win rates. I struggled to find my footing in the format early on and didn't have time/resources for a lot of events and only managed the single trophy. Any combination with red or green was a challenge. Hopefully I do better with the next set!

### 7-x Drafts

Took me a while to get my bearings and didn't get my one and only trophy until a couple of weeks into the format with Quick Draft #3.

### Arena Open Attempts

Threw away some gold and gems on two runs at the Arena Open the weekend of November 27th, featuring Brothers War sealed. Finished 5-3 and 2-3 respectively. I really should just remember to never do a second run, they never go well! Resources are limited! Got some cool Mythics and Rares though.
