I don't really follow wrestling that much anymore, but when I do, it's one of two events: The Royal Rumble (always fun) and Wrestlemania. Last year I started group-watching them with some friends, and we are doing that again this year. Watching with friends is always fun because I'm so out of the loop so they can tell me about new wrestlers and recent storylines and we often reminisce about the old-timey wrestling stuff.

Was happy to find out this time that Disney+ was streaming the Royal Rumble live! Made things a lot easier. Wasn't able to watch live though, we saw it Monday night. The Disney+ version was a bit odd because they would randomly show these weird gray bars covering the lower part of the screen; we later found out it was because they were blocking the ads shown by WWE. And they also inserted ads for their own shows!

Anyway, the event itself was ok. We only watched the Men's Rumble, the Women's Rumble, and the main/event Title Match. (These events are so long, we didn't have time to watch everything!)

Was slightly annoyed at the Men's Rumble because the internet had already spoiled me as to who the winner was. Who puts that in article headline less than 24h after the event airs? Still, it was entertaining enough, although the eventual winner being the one who started at #30 was kind of lame. There were some great performances though, and I liked how Gunther (who I believe is new as he wasn't in the Rumble or Mania last year; this year he started at #1) was pushed and actually broke the previous record for longest stay in the Rumble. 

Women's Rumble was kind of meh, mostly because I didn't know most of these people (back in my day, they didn't have enough women wrestlers to fill a rumble!). Title match was okay, though Mr Tribal Chief needs to be dethroned soon, and Zayn turn was very telegraphed.
