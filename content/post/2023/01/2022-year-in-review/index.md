title: 2022 Year in Review
toc: true
---

This is a personal year in review. You can check the [yearnotes tag](/tags/yearnotes) for previous years-in-review. Last year's review is [here](/2022/01/2021-year-in-review/).

### Essay-writing section

In many ways, 2022 felt like an extension of 2021 for me personally. I think I was mostly doing the same things and not really expanding my horizons too much.

For the world, it was a challenging year. Russia's invasion of Ukraine caused ripples that not only threaten world stability but also affected the global economy. The PH elections had a not-unexpected but still sad outcome. In the tech world, Musk's acquisition of Twitter threatens to accelerate the collapse of the old social-media paradigm. 

The country largely started lifting most COVID restrictions this year, though many people are still masking. My parents and I managed to get second COVID booster doses. With the easing of restrictions, we were able to spend more quality time with my brothers and their families. We also got a new family member: *Pamangkin*#7 (Niece#4) was born in October.

In the later part of the year, one of my oldest friends passed away unexpectedly. I was unable to attend the wake in Singapore because my passport had lapsed. The sadness still lingers whenever I look back at 2022.

Professionally, this was another hiatus year for me (see work stats below), same as last year. Repeating from last year: privilege, tired of capitalism, [wandering through life finding interesting things](/2021/06/life-philosophy/), etc.

Financially, my savings dipped a bit, as could be expected. My expenses were actually only 75% of the previous year's expenses, so that's nice. However, the poor stock market and crypto performance this year hit my savings/net worth/runway a bit (yes, I still have a bit of crypto), adding to the year's losses. Everything is still manageable, but with record-high inflation, I'm starting to worry. Well, worry more than usual.

My only major expense of the year was [buying a new PC in late December](/2022/12/pc-build-2022/).

Because of the above I have been thinking of already looking for new part-time or full-time work this coming year. At the same time I am still really enjoying these hiatus years and all the time to pursue my interests and entertainment. And actually my personal savings runway is still significant, so that might be a bit of a tossup for now. Though I do worry that maybe taking a third hiatus year in a row would be like crossing a rubicon that I can never come back from.

### 2022 In Numbers

Once again, the main reason this post took a while to come out is that I took some time to put these stats together.

#### Work, Travel, Learning and Self Improvement

- Hours worked: 0, same as last year.
    - Before working on this post, I actually thought I did some work in the early part of 2021, but turns out I was remembering 2020 instead (time flowed differently during the pandemic), so this is actually my second hiatus year in a row! I am privileged that I can live this way, but I'm not sure how much longer it can last.
- Programming languages/frameworks learned: 0 (1 last year). :sadface:
- Duolingo streak: 1448 days (from 1082 last year). 
    - Once again, the math here doesn't add up, since 1448 - 1082 is only 363. And once again, I'm pretty sure I never broke the Duolingo streak this year, not even with a streak freeze! I am currently very doubtful about the effectiveness of Duolingo, mostly because when Spanish questions appear in crosswords, I always have trouble remembering even the simplest ones! I would guess that I'm at the stage where if I want to further improve in Spanish or Japanese I need more focused effort, and I don't think I have the time for that. That being said, the cost to keep going with Duolingo is low (around 5 minutes a day), so I don't expect to stop anytime soon.
    - There was [a Duolingo year in review](/2022/12/duolingo-stats/)!
- Other countries visited: 0! I did take [a trip with my parents to Bicol in July](/2022/07/five-days-in-naga/) to attend a cousin's wedding though.

#### On this site

- 138 [blog posts](/blog/), 105,510 words worth; from 155 posts and 99,852 words last year. Less posts but more words implies my posts are getting longer on average! Below are some of the 2022 ones I really liked (that aren't weeknotes or reviews):

    - [The list.](/lists/media/movies/2022/)
    - No real theme here, though I think I started watching more dark/tragic comedies and even my first Indian film!
    - Watched 6 movies in the cinema this year, just the superhero ones. First time I'm watching in the cinemas again since the pandemic started. I actually wish I could watch more movies in the cinemas, but tickets are so expensive nowadays!
    - My favorite films I watched this year: 
        - [Pig (2021)](/2022/12/movies-tv-2022/#pig-2021)
        - [The Batman (2022)](/2022/03/the-batman/)

        - [Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery (2022)](/2022/12/weeknotes-12-25/#glassonion)
- **Books** read: 19, down from last year's 26
    - [The list](/lists/media/books/2022/), with 18 fiction and 1 nonfiction.
    - This year's reads was mostly getting back up to speed with the works of some familiar writers. I read 6 [Discworld](/blog/tags/discworld/) books, 4 Agathe Christie books, and 4 books from [Brandon Sanderson](/blog/tags/sanderson/).
    - I think my favorite fiction reads of the year were [Le Guin's Lathe of Heaven](/2022/03/lathe-of-heaven-/) and [A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers](/2022/06/weeknotes-06-12/#a-psalm-for-the-wild-built-by-becky-chambers). My only nonfiction read of the year was [Meditations by Marcus Aurelius](/2022/02/meditations/).
    - I think I will target to read a bit more nonfiction this year.
- **TV/Streaming**
    - [Here's the list](/lists/media/tv/2022/) of all the TV shows I've written about this year.
        - I wrote about 36 shows this year, up from 19 last year, probably just due to being more obsessive about logging things.
    - **Netflix**: 303 items in the watch history (578 last year). Numbers are way down! I would guess it's because I found myself watching more stuff on **Prime Video** and even **Disney+** this year (which just launched in the PH!)
    - My favorite shows of the year are [She-Hulk: Attorney at Law](/2022/10/watching-lately-marvel/#she-hulk-attorney-at-law) and [Andor](/2022/12/weeknotes-12-11/#andor).
- **Comics**
    - This year, I decided to start tracking comics read as well, separately from books. Here's [the 2022 list](/lists/media/comics/2022/).
    - I also started an insane project in the second half of the year to attempt to read all Marvel comics! Tracking this effort via [the tag complete-marvel-run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run). I have already fallen behind!
- **Music**
    - Music tracks played (Spotify/LastFM): 884. (1672 last year). See [listening stats here](/page/stats/listening/). Also, [here's my 2022 Spotify Wrapped](/2022/12/spotify-wrapped/).
    - My Spotify count is very low because this year I found myself turning more to YouTube for listening to music, and I have yet to find a way to extract my listening stats from there.

#### Gaming

#### Trivia Team

- With COVID restrictions easing in 2022, we saw the return of in-person [quiz nights](/tags/quiznight/)! We attended 5 such quiz nights, winning twice and placing 3rd three times. An excellent performance!
- Late in 2021, I got a subscription to the NYT crosswords/games, mainly because the trivia team had been enjoying doing them together over Discord during the pandemic. As of today, we are at a 370-day crossword streak! We also regularly do the Spelling Bee. At some point during the year, we also started doing the acrostics, working our way through the back catalog. The NYT archive goes all the way back to 1993; we do go back and do older crosswords on occasion, sometimes by myself. I have this fantasy that someday I will be able to complete this entire back catalog!
- Speaking of the NYT, in the early part of the year, we also spent an inordinate amount of time playing [Wordle](/tags/wordle/) and all its variants.
- Late in 2022, Discord introduced some games that your group could play together in the voice channels. We enjoyed a few of these, [Bobble League](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsBCyKvBrfE) most of all.
- The Trivia Team has a YT channel, [@teamcamoteph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsBCyKvBrfE) where we upload recordings of the above shenanigans and other gaming things. We uploaded 67 videos in 2022!

#### Others

- Fitbit activity: 1,916,052 steps, 1,493.29 km, up almost 60% from last year!
    - With the pandemic restrictions loosening up early this year, I started to take longer walks outside the subdivision again, ramping up to the end of the year. By December I was up to 8k average daily steps, up from 5.5k in May and 3k in January. Not only is this great progress, it turns out this is now my highest yearly step total since I started using a Fitbit in 2017! (Previous record was 1.826M steps in 2018.) Hopefully I can keep up the pace this year.
- Donuts eaten: 6 donuts, down from 8 last year!
- Baptisms attended: 1, up from 0 last year
- Weddings attended: 1, up from 0 last year
- Wakes attended: 1 (virtual) :sadface:
- New pamangkins: 1
- Grab:
    - Trips: 2, down from 12 last year
        - Pa is able to drive again, so much less need for Grab. Also, their prices have gotten way too high, so whenever I need to go anywhere by myself, I just take regular taxis as much as possible.
    - Food delivery: 9, way down from 58 last year
        - With pandemic restrictions easing, I was getting deliveries a lot less and just going into the actual restaurants to buy food for takeout and sometimes even dine-in.
    - GrabMart: 0 (0 last year). This was really just a pandemic necessity in 2021, so we'll be dropping this stat next year.
    - Express delivery: 3, down from 6 last year. Again, mostly sending out stuff to/from family members.
- Bears defeated in single combat: 0
- Tips received via [my profile on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/roytang): 2. This is DOUBLE last year's total! Wow, imagine that. I am very grateful to all/both of my supporters!

### The future

One last statistic: this year's yearnotes is about 15% longer than last year's. Thought about splitting this one in multiple posts, but for now it stays as one.

For me, the year in review post is about the past year. My next post will be my 2023 checklist, where I talk about the future and things I'm looking forward to in the coming year.
