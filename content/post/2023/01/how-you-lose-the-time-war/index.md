I'm not big on love stories as the main focus of a book, but wrap it in a sci-fi shell and I'll give it a go. Presented as an exchange of 'letters' between two agents on opposing sides of the titular Time War, *This is How You Lose the Time War* doesn't start out as a love story, but it eventually gets there.

(I have learned a new word, "epistolary", meaning "presented as a series of letters or other similar documents.)

The book is presented as a series of short vignettes of each agent's activites as the travel across worlds, timelines and lifetimes, influencing events to favor their side in the war. At the end of each vignette they find a 'letter' from the enemy agent, usually encoded in some form or pattern that no normal resident of the time period would be able to discern. The two agents start out taunting each other, ending their missives with a boast about how their side will surely win the Time War, but eventually the boasting gives way to curiosity and engagement and much more than that and as you can imagine complicates their status as elite agents for their sides. Each letter is incredibly poignant and well-crafted and I am sad that I lack the words to describe how good they are.

Although the story is wrapped in a sci-fi shell and each vignette has some sort of sci-fi element to it, the science fiction isn't really the focus here. The causes or scope of the titular Time War are never really elaborated on, nor are their methods for traversing the worlds and centuries.

The book came out in 2019 and I've had my copy of this for a couple of years maybe, but it kind of blew up in 2023 after [a viral tweet from one "bigolas dickolas woIfwood"](https://twitter.com/maskofbun/status/1655084850926473216):
