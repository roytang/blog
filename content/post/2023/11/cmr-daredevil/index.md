### Previously

This is part 6 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED**. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). This one is all about Daredevil.

*(Note: All volume nos. are based on [the Wikipedia listings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(A))*

For previous installments, I only read the oldest/longest volumes, which would typically end around the 90s. For this Daredevil installment, I went a different direction: this post will cover ALL the mainline Daredevil titles up to the present day (excluding the most recent volume, which just started).

This post is over 3,000 words long! You can use the TOC above to navigate.

### Daredevil v1

- Daredevil v1 (1964-1998): 381 issues
- Daredevil v1 Annual: 8 issues (not including 2 reprint issues)
- Daredevil / Deadpool '97: 1 issue

As is typical of early Marvel volumes, the first decade or two of Daredevil was mostly villain-of-the-week type capers. Matt Murdock's supporting crew - partners Fogey Nelson and secretary / one true love Karen Page are introduced early on. 

Daredevil's early stable of villains was pretty weak, especially compared to Spider-Man's stable: many of Spider-Man's early villains like Doctor Octopus (ASM #3), Electro (ASM #9), Green Goblin (ASM#14), etc have gone on to have prominent story arcs up to the modern day and even appeared in feature films while Daredevil's early villains was a rotating stable of eventual B- and C-listers like Mr Hyde and Cobra, Stilt-Man, the Trickster, Mr Fear, The Gladiator (Melvin Poter), and so on, villains who never really made a huge impact on the Marvel universe.

{{% note "2023/09/111138666200388561/" %}}

The first real iconic Daredevil villain was Bullseye, introduced in the 1970s by Wolfman and Romita Sr. During this decade, Matt and Karen also split up, with Karen moving to the West Coast to pursue an acting career, and she was replaced as Daredevil's love interest by Natasha Romanov, the Black Widow. The book was even titled Daredevil and Black Widow for a while! 

The most iconic run of this volume, and one that would define Daredevil well into the modern era and up to present day was of course Frank Miller's run in the 1980s. Miller would introduce the ninja cult The Hand and the assassin Elektra, both of whom would become major players in Matt Murdock's life. Miller also re-introduces Wilson Fisk (previously first appearing as a Spider-Man villain) and builds him up as Daredevil's iconic nemesis, a relationship which lasts until the present day.

Later in the volume Karen Page, having gone through a rough patch that involves drug use and a stint in smutty movies, sells the secret of Matt's identity for money, a secret which eventually makes its way into the Kingpin's hands! Fisk uses this knowledge to systematically take apart Murdock's life and his law practice, leaving him with almost nothing. During this down point in his life, Matt and Karen get back together.

Writer Ann Nocenti started a long four year run after Miller, introducing the character Typhoid Mary and for a while had Murdock wandering around as a drifter in upstate New York. That last part wasn't particularly good.

In the 90s, writer D.G. Chichester takes over from Nocenti for the last part of this volume and brings Matt back to NYC, reuniting him with Foggy and Karen and regaining his attorney's license. The 90s sees Daredevil sport a new armored costume (the typical 90s "edgy" redesign). At some point Matt fakes his own death (again!) to avoid his identity as Daredevil being exposed and takes on a new persona of Jack Batlin. 

Towards the end of the volume, Matt's identity would be restored and he and Foggy would join a law firm headed Foggy's mother Rosalind Sharpe.

### Daredevil v2

- Daredevil v2 (1998-2011): 132 issues
- Daredevil v2 Annual (2007): 1 issue

This volume starts what I consider the era of "modern Daredevil", and this volume in particular really puts Daredevil through the wringer. The very first arc by Kevin Smith ends with the death of Matt Murdock's one true love Karen Page at the hands of Bullseye.

The early part of the volume is dominated by David Mack's writing. Mack and Joe Quesada's most notable contribution to the lore is the introduction of the character Echo. 

This volume also has a greater focus on Matt Murdock's activities as an attorney - two of the earlier story arcs focus on trial cases, including one where a client is suing Daredevil himself.

The other highlights of this volume are Bendis' run somewhere in the middle and Brubaker's run near the end.

Bendis introduces a new love interest for Matt Murdock in the form of Milla Donovan, a civilian who is also blind and would eventually become Matt's wife and later ex-wife. While building up their relationship, Bendis also starts to break down Matt's life when a newspaper leaks his identity as Daredevil to the press. This results in even more legal shenanigans as Matt fights back, denies the allegations and sues the Globe. Bendis also brings back Wilson Fisk as a major player in Matt's life, and Matt is also sent to prison for the first time because of the accusations that he is Daredevil (which are never proven!). 

Bendis' run had him working a lot with frequent collaborator Alex Maleev, whose art is fantastic. Bendis' run was intense and I honestly liked it a lot more than Miller's. 

{{% photos ddv2 %}}

Brubaker's run was also pretty good. He introduces a new version of classic Daredevil villain Mr Fear, an enemy that eventually drives Milla insane and ends their marriage. His run ends with bringing back the Hand as Daredevil's major adversaries and eventually Matt gives in to temptation and takes up the mantle of leadership of the ninja cult, culminating in the Shadowland event which punctuated this volume. I think I started reading modern Daredevil in the middle of Brubaker's run, as I do recall reading at least the mainline Shadowland event. (I probably started reading Daredevil because at the time he was already a member of Bendis' *New Avengers*.)

### Shadowland

- Shadowland: 5 issues
- Shadowland: Moon Knight: 3 issues
- Shadowland: Elektra: 1 issue
- Shadowland: Bullseye: 1 issue
- Shadowland: Spider-Man: 1 issue
- Shadowland: Power Man: 4 issues
- Shadowland: Ghost Rider: 1 issue
- Shadowland: Daughters of the Shadow: 3 issues
- Shadowland: Blood on the Streets: 4 issues
- Shadowland: After the Fall: 1 issue

{{% photos IMG %}}

The Shadowland event sees the Hand take over Hell's Kitchen with Daredevil as their leader. The street level heroes of New York come together to oppose the Hand and the crossover ends with the reveal that Matt had been possessed by the Beast worshipped by the hand. The series ends with the Hand taken down and Matt vanishing from NYC.

### Daredevil Reborn

- Daredevil Reborn: 4 issues

This was a short limited series that had Murdock wandering somewhere outside the city, running into trouble, and deciding to come back as Daredevil again.

### Daredevil v3

- Daredevil v3 (2011-2014): 38 issues (including 10.1 and 1.5)
- Daredevil v3 Annual (2012): 1 issue

This is Mark Waid's first run on Daredevil, and is significantly more light-hearted than the previous volume, focusing more on crime-fighting adventures and legal escapades than tearing down Matt's life. Matt and Foggy start a new practice in NYC, but have trouble finding clients due to the allegations that Matt is Daredevil. Instead they start a legal consultancy to help nonlawyers defend themselves in court, avoiding Matt appearing in court himself. This volume introduces a new love interest: assistant DA Kirsten McDuffie who eventually becomes one of Matt's legal allies.

The volume ends with Matt being blackmailed by a neo-Nazi group that has proof of his secret identity. To get around the blackmail, Matt testifies in court to being Daredevil!

{{% note "2018/10/179606478532/" %}}

### Daredevil v4

- Daredevil v4 (2014-2015): 20 issues (including 0.1 and 15.1)

This is Mark Waid's second run. After testifying to being Daredevil under oath, Matt and Foggy are disbarred. Matt moves to LA with Kirsten to practice law there instead (he had practiced there before during v1), all while being open with his identity as Daredevil. Foggy fakes his own death because of a cancer diagnosis and to avoid being targeted as Daredevil's friend. 

The short volume mostly has Matt dealing with gangsters The Owl, Wilson Fisk (of course), and The Shroud, who is supposedly a good guy. Waid introduces a new villain, an assassin named Ikari, who has Daredevil's own radar sense and is NOT blind, making more than a match for Daredevil. 

The art on Waid's two runs was often very colorful and more cartoony compared to previous runs. His regular artist was Chris Samnee.

### Daredevil v5 and v6

- Daredevil v5 (2015-2018): 28 issues
- Daredevil v5 Annual (2016): 1 issue
- Daredevil v6 (2018-2019): 18 issues
- Daredevil v6 Annual (2018): 1 issue

This is Charles Soule's run, split into two volumes on the Wikipedia list due to the renumbering, though some other sources will consider this as one volume. The volume starts with Matt Murdock back in NYC with his identity as Daredevil mysteriously a secret to everybody again (except for Foggy Nelson, who he is on the outs with). Matt is no longer with Kirsten and is instead working as a low level prosecutor in the city's District Attorney's office.

This volume introduces a new "sidekick" for Matt, an illegal immigrant who invented an invisiblity suit, calling himself Blindspot, and a new villain, a serial killer named Muse, who eventually takes out Blindspot's eyes, ending his career as a vigilante. 

During this run, Matt takes on an ambitious project for the DA's office: he sets up legal precedent to allow superheroes/vigilantes to testify in court without having to reveal their secret identities. Matt goes so far as to screw up at the appeals court so that he can argue the case before the US Supreme Court and have his victory enshrined as the law of the land. There's a lot of legal shenanigans in this volume, probably because Charles Soule is himself also an attorney!

Eventually, it is revealed that Matt's secret identity was restored after he saved the children of Zebediah Kilgrave, aka the Purple Man. The children were grateful and used their combined powers to remove Daredevil's identity from the world's memory, all without asking Matt first.

The second half of the volume has Matt's life turned upside down by a political event - while he was away from NYC, Wilson Fisk was elected the mayor! Fisk enlists Matt as deputy mayor, a largely ceremonial position meant to distract him, which backfires when the Hand invades NYC and Fisk is incapacitated and Matt takes over as acting mayor!

At some point, Matt's "twin brother" Mike Murdock, an alias he has used in the past to hide his secret identity, is brought to life through an encounter with a reality-shaping mutant.

The volume ends with "The Death of Daredevil", a story arc where Matt gets hit by a car and while in the ambulance has an extended dream sequence that has him taking down his enemies and finding proof Wilson Fisk cheated in the elections and taking him down. I was fooled by this dream sequence TWICE, once when I first read the arc, and the second time when I was re-reading it for this post. The key was the villain Ikari who Matt fought during the dream sequence, which was weird considering Ikari was killed during Waid's run! Both times I googled how Ikari survived, only to realize a few issues later it was a dream sequence! I'm not sure how this particular story arc was received lol.

{{% note "2018/11/180089412453/" %}}

Soule's regular artist on this run was Ron Garney, whose work I'm also a big fan of.


### Daredevil v7

- Daredevil v7 (2019-2022): 36 issues
- Daredevil v7 Annual (2020): 1 issue

This is Chip Zdarsky's first run, with Marco Chechetto as primary artist. The volume has Matt serving again as Daredevil in the crime-ridden streets of Fisk's NYC. It introduces a new supporting character in police detective Cole North. Early in the volume, running ragged, Daredevil accidentally kills a perp and it is caught on camera. North convinces Daredevil that he has to pay for that crime, and he agrees to be confess and imprisoned, on the condition that he is never unmasked. Somehow the courts agree to his condition. This is the second time Matt has been imprisoned, although this time as Daredevil and not as Matt Murdock.

While Matt is in prison, Elektra dons the red costume and takes over the mantle of Daredevil in his stead.

This volume culminates in the Devil's Reign crossover.

### Devil's Reign

- Devil's Reign: 6 issues
- Daredevil: Woman Without Fear: 3 issues
- Devil's Reign: Superior Four: 3 issues
- Devil's Reign: Villains for Hire: 3 issues
- Devil's Reign: X-Men: 3 issues
- Devil's Reign: Moon Knight
- Devil's Reign: Spider-Man
- Devil's Reign: Winter Soldier
- Devil's Reign Omega

In this crossover, Wilson Fisk, still mayor of NYC, finds out that his mind has been manipulated to erase Daredevil's secret identity. After being taunted by Matt, Fisk wages all-out war on the city's superheroes, passing a law outright banning superheroes in the city. It's kind of a mini-Civil War/Dark Reign all over again: heroes such as the Fantastic Four and Moon Knight are hunted down and imprisoned, and Fisk hires a cadre of villains to serve as legally mandated Thunderbolts to enforce his laws. 

Fisk also enlists the help of Otto Octavius to study the powers of the Purple Man and uses that power to influence the upcoming mayoral election. Octavius takes over the Baxter Building and uses Reed's multiversal gateway to recruit some of his variants with powers of other heroes - a "Superior Four". The heroes decide to have Luke Cage stand up against Fisk and run against him as mayor.

Eventually, Fisk uses the purple powers to restore his memory of Matt's secret identity. Filled with rage, Fisk goes after Murdock as the heroes escape from prison and battle the Thunderbolts on the streets of NYC. Fisk runs into Mike Murdock posing as his brother and murders him in front of an eyewitness, leading to his disqualification from the mayoral race.

Fisk eventual escapes with his lover Typhoid Mary. "Matt Murdock" has a funeral (not the first time he has "died!"). Fisk's son Butch Pharris is the new Kingpin of NYC. Luke Cage becomes mayor of NYC

### Daredevil v8

- Daredevil v8 (2022-2023): 14 issues

This is Chip Zdarsky's second run. With Matt Murdock presmued dead, this volume focuses on Matt and Elektra establishing an army called the Fist to wage war on the Hand. Matt and Elektra are married after an ancient ritual. They assemble a cadre of former villains and start training them to fight the hand. But it all falls apart eventually and the souls of their allies and world leaders replaced by the Hand are devoured by the Beast in hell. The volume ends with Matt descending into hell himself to defeat the Beast once and for all, sacrificing himself to free the captured souls.

### Summary

I read a reddit thread a while back asking which character has the longest streak of good runs and Daredevil was one of the top candidates, and it's hard to disagree. Starting with v2, each volume has been top-notch with both great art and writing. Modern Daredevil has been really, really good, though that usually means bad news for Matt Murdock himself. I was only planning to read summaries of v3 onwards to refresh myself since I've read them before, but I ended up re-reading most of them anyway since they were so good.

If I had to recommend Daredevil runs to read, from most to least recommended would be:

- v2 Bendis
- v1 Miller
- v2 Brubaker
- Zdarsky
- Soule
- Waid

(Waid lands at the bottom of this list but is still very good!)

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 731

Total issues covered so far: 2771 + 731 = 3,502

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 34,189 (+297 from 3 months ago)

Progress: 10.24% (up by 2.06% from the last post)

I started this [complete-marvel-run](/tags/complete-marvel-run) thing about a year and a half ago. At this rate it would take me an additional 13.5 years to catch up with everything! 

Luckily, I still have scads of series I've already read that remain unlogged, though I might have to re-read some of them when the time comes, like I did for the modern Daredevil runs. I'm hoping the already-read-yet-unlogged series contributes a significant chunk to the percentage!

### Up Next

I am not yet sure what to read next. I was previously planning to do all the Netflix series before proceeding to MCU phase 2 heroes, but I'm kind of overstuffed with street-level heroics after all that Daredevil, so I might go with either Doctor Strange or Guardians of the Galaxy. GotG would be a much shorter read than DS, but I suspect I will prefer the Sorcerer Supreme first. 

Previously I was doing only the oldest volumes of each series and stopping right before the modern era, but now that I've tried following one character straight for the entire run I find this method more preferable. Going through the v1's is usually a slog, since the writing was much worse in the 60s and 70s, so having the modern runs to look forward to can only be a good thing. I think I will adapt that moving forward, and will try to find time to squeeze in the modern runs of the ones I've already covered.

This also results in this post being more than 3,000 words long, a new record for this series of posts! I'll need to figure out how to manage the post length better, but I can't avoid listing out the highlights of each run as in the future this post will be my reference for remembering the runs.
