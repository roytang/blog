Cleaned out my sling bag today, so I thought I'd do an "Everyday Carry" post.

{{% photos IMG_1488 %}}

My default bag when I go out is that black sling bag. I suspect I've been carrying it for at least a decade, though maybe I replaced it at some point and forgot. Before that I was using a brown sling bag. I have no idea what brand it is.

The default contents of this bag are on the left: umbrella, some water (in recycled coke bottle), wallet, cellphone, and a foldable blue shopping bag (useful when I decide to pass by the grocery or such.) 

The bag has many pockets and is also just the right size to hold a variety of objects that I bring depending on need: It can fit the Nintendo Switch, an iPad, a notebook and pens, documents (folded crosswise), and so on. I will also occasionally have a powerbank, bluetooth earphones and such. The front pocket almost always has [a lot of coins](/2015/03/10153614697573912-0/), that's where I put my change!

The smaller gray sling bag was a gift from a couple of years ago. I really only use it for short walks where I don't expect to stray far from home. It usually carries just my cellphone and a small amount of cash.

For longer trips or when I need to carry bigger things, I still use [my Northface backpack from 2015](/2015/07/10153930078723912/). It's big enough to carry [my Macbook Air](/2018/12/macbook-air-2017/), a bunch of chargers, notebooks, all of the stuff from the above, a change of clothes, and so on.

I sometimes see other people's "everyday carry" posts and they always carry so much stuff like knives and chargers and notebooks and tools and whatnot; I understand the idea of prepared-ness, but I prefer to be carrying as few things as possible whenever I go out!
