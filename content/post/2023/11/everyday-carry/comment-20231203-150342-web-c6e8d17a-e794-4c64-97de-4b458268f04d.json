  "text": "Thanks for the advice, but is this advice assuming that I just use and carry the same plastic coke bottle all the time? I guess I should have mentioned it but I switch it out after each use and get a new one from the ref (so that the water is cold). We have a lot of these plastic coke bottles around since my dad buys a lot of coke and it seems a waste to not reuse them. They are rinsed out before being reused. If I finish one while I'm out I will often just dispose of it so that I don't have to carry it home and we have so many already.",
