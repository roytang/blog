  "text": "Most of the site uses a hand-rolled Python/Django backend. It is definitely not simple (see the About -> Site page for some details), but it works for me.\r\n\r\nOne thing about this site is all the content (including comments) are saved as markdown or json files in a public Github repository, so for the comments in particular, I can't ask for any private information like email addresses and that's also why I don't use any other auth system. One of the downsides is that there's no way to notify the commenter that there's a reply if the comment doesn't come in from another site via webmentions. Like this one! So IDK if you ever get to read this reply.\r\n\r\nIncoming webmentions are processed from webmention.io",
