### The World

War crimes continue in Gaza. Ukraine still trying to repel the Russian invasion. Trump has his day in court. SAG-AFTRA strike finally ends. Volcanic eruption in Iceland. Republicans do poorly in US local elections. The last Beatles song is released.

### My Week

This week was kinda busy. For me, busy generally means "I had to go out a lot and that made me miss a bunch of daily stuff I usually do." 

Attend two quiz nights this week: [did terribly at the first one](2023/11/geekfight-league-5/) but [won the second one](2023/11/popquiz-marvels/). Winning the second one let me [watch a movie](2023/11/loki-s2-marvels/#the-marvels-2023) for free! Any time I go out to things like this I always leave the house early so I can spend some of the extra time taking my steps (excuse me, my "daily constitutionals") at the malls, so it takes out a good chunk of my day.

On the blog: I wrote a bit about [Old folks and tech](/2023/11/old-folks-and-tech/) and also shared some links about [Words](/2023/11/words/).

Earlier in the week we also got some medical news that meant more family expenses starting next year. Sigh.

A couple of weeks ago, I promised to clean out our extra room because a lot of the stuff in there is tech detritus from me - boxes, old monitors and other hardware etc. I haven't gotten around to it, but I'm hoping to power through it over the next few weeks and have it done by end of the year. As a bonus, I believe some of the drawers in that room also has records and relics from me and my brothers' childhoods, always fun to dig through those.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still haven't finished the final **Super Mario Bros Wonder** stage.
    - I beat [a fun boss fight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bk2AqXsJsWU) in **Baldur's Gate 3** though. I'm hoping to power through BG3 this coming week, so that I can finally finish at least one of the 3 RPGs I started 3 months ago!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, as much as I can at least, I think I missed a day or two. **Eternal** has been neglected.

- **Reading**: While I still continued my re-read of Daredevil volumes this past week, I also found myself going through some older manga I used to read in the 2000s, mostly as part of my prep for one of the week's quiz nights. I realized [I never finished reading Liar Game](/2011/12/145205668629053440/), so I found a way to read the last few volumes of that. Terrible ending though lol. Might write about it at some point.

- **Watching**: Watched [The Marvels (2023)](/2023/11/loki-s2-marvels/#the-marvels-2023) on Halloween. Finished watching (and wrote reviews for) [Loki S2](2023/11/loki-s2-marvels/#loki-s2) and [Pluto](2023/11/pluto/). Still binge-ing Scrubs, I think I'm only one season away from completion.

### Walking

Managed to hit 70,119 steps this week, once again hitting my weekly target! Note that the 70k steps doesn't actually mean I manage 10k steps per day. Usually each day I manage to do a little extra, then I get a bit of a "rest" Saturday since I don't need to hit 10k because of the accumulated extra steps throughout the week.

They can improve their grasp, but first they should stop telling themselves that there’s nothing new happening in the world."

A bunch of stuff I'm looking forward to this week:

We also have a quiz night again on Thursday, and I'm scheduled to draft with some peeps on Saturday (in person! How novel.)
