title: 'MCU Reviews: Loki S2 / The Marvels'
---

### Loki S2

I wasn't expecting much for the S2 finale, but this one was oddly satisfying and even makes me feel better about the first season. Season 2 feels much better paced (although the first half felt a bit sleepy) and brings Loki's character arc full circle and somehow even manages to bring a new paradigm to the MCU Multiverse.

Ke Huy Quan is a welcome addition to the MCU, I'm glad his career is going well.

Also, there is some form of Groundhog Day time looping in there, and I love Groundhog Day time loops.

### The Marvels (2023)

Somehow managed to [win two tickets for a screening of the film last night](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-marvels), so we got to watch for free. Luckily we hadn't bought tickets for our planned Saturday IMAX viewing yet, I don't think IMAX would have been worth it.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and it was fun but it definitely had it's flaws and I understand the mixed reviews. 

My brother said it felt like a "filler episode", whatever that means.

I had read some complaints before about how there was so much "homework" (i.e. prior MCU stuff) to watch before this film, which is a general problem with serialized storytelling, but I feel like they did the best they could given the circumstances.

Kamala/Iman Vellani continues to bring an excellent exuberant performance and she and her family are the best part of the film, mainly because they provide the most relatable human behaviors - fangirling and worrying about your kids. Kamala gets a short intro sequence (complete with animated drawing sequences calling back to her series) that gives the gist: she's a Captain Marvel fangirl with super powers from a bangle.

Monica felt the least developed of the three main characters; it's been something like 35 years since Carol left her, I feel like she could have gotten over it by now. Her back story is much more straightforward since the character was introduced in Captain Marvel and the only actual important plot point from Wandavision was that she walked through a hex and got powers. Although the explanation for her powers feels super hokey and contrived to allow for the ending the movie wanted to have.

The main plot revolves around Carol and what she's been doing the last 35 years (aside from helping beat Thanos, etc) and how she has to deal with the consequences of her actions. The problem here is that there is very little time/effort spent to discuss those actions such that the villain comes off feeling kind of meh and unsympathetic and overall boring.

Actually, I guess that's the main problem I find with the film: there's a lot happening, but it all happens so fast and so quickly. Character moments are overshadowed by all the comic book stuff and don't get time to breathe and aren't really played up so they have much less impact. I understand how it can all be overwhelming, especially to the casual viewer. (I would hate to be watching this movie with my mom as I would need to explain basically everything!)

The whole entanglement/switching conceit was a fun way to bring the characters together, but could be hard to follow and felt like it wasn't super consistent in whatever rules it had.

Also, IDK if it was the acoustics of the cinema I was watching in but I was having trouble hearing some of the dialog. I am looking forward to rewatching this with subtitles on (especially the time on Aldana, that was fun).

MCU film slate for 2024 has been trimmed down to just Deadpool 3 I believe, which is overall probably a good thing, let people take a breath away from the MCU for a bit.
