It is November! Time marches inexorably forward, despite our protests. The sun is beginning to set on 2023.

### My Week

I am not sure where this week went. I think I just mostly enjoyed the holidays watching TV and reading comics. Which is not too different from recent weeks if we're being honest.

My parents managed to do a cemetery visit last Friday, after the madness that is Undas crowds. I was supposed to come along but was preoccupied at the time. (Read: I had taken a nap and no one bothered to wake me.) I have not been to a cemetery since before the pandemic.

On the blog: I ranted a bit about [Growth and Techno-Optimism](/2023/10/growth/). 

Also, I completed [Inktober 2023](/tags/inktober2023/)!

I did not start a Nanowrimo. I did not vote in this year's Barangay/SK Elections.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I am mostly done with **Super Mario Bros Wonder**, except for the stupid brutal final final badge marathon stage. I have been stuck at the final checkpoint the whole week, unable to get past the final invisibility section. The completionist in me demands that I finish this stage before writing my review, but I only do a few attempts at a time, so it may take a while.
    - The Mario Wonder attempts don't take too much time, so I also resumed **Baldur's Gate 3** in the meantime, managed to clean up a bunch of Act III quests this week.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, and I think drafted **Eternal** a couple of days. The next MTG set *Lost Caverns of Ixalan* comes out in a couple of weeks, so I went ahead and wrote my limited recap for [Wilds of Eldraine](/2023/10/mtgwoe-limited-recap/).

- **Reading**: Powered through both Daredevil v2 and v3 this past week. There's like 4 more modern volumes remaining, it's not a lot so I plan to re-read them, since modern Daredevil has been fairly good. Still need to start a new book though.

- **Watching**: Watched [A Haunting in Venice (2023)](/2023/10/a-haunting-in-venice-2023/) on Halloween. Wrote [some TV reviews](/2023/11/oct2023-tv-lower-decks-superman-harley/). Still binging *Scrubs*, currently almost done with season 6. Trying to keep up with *Loki*, *Invincible S2*. Still a lot more stuff I want to watch!

### Walking

Managed to hit 70,191 steps this week, so I am back to hitting my weekly target! It has been a bit challenging, especially given how randomly rainy the past week has been. Here's hoping we can keep it going.

### Things I've been thinking about

Stagnation, creativity, exploring, repetitiveness, it's ok to not be ambitious, sadness, writing, water color, aimlessness, managing the archives.

### Things I'm looking forward to

Trivia team has two quiz nights scheduled again this week, hoping we do well.

Loki season finale next week, I am expecting a total nothingburger.
