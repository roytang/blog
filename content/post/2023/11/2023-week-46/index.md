title: "2023 Week 46"
---

It is now week 46 of 2023, the year is almost done!

### The World

Israeli forces assault a hospital. Trump found to have engaged in insurrection but allowed to remain on the ballot. OpenAI CEO unexpectedly ousted by board. Musk turns off advertisers with his antisemitism (who could have seen this coming?). 

### My Week

These weeknotes are coming in a bit late because the second half of the week was exhausting for me and I spent most of Sunday sleeping in and recovering my energy. 

Part of the busyness was family-related: visits from the *pamangkins*, entertaining *balikbayans*, and the usual medical errands. Lots of discussion about the upcoming medical expenses.

Thursday I attended [a quiz night in Greenhills](/2023/11/popquiz-friendsgiving/) and we won!

On the blog: I wrote a bit about [Blog Anniversaries](/2023/11/blog-anniversaries/).

I have still not started cleaning out the extra room.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - I FINALLY beat the final **Super Mario Bros Wonder** stage, but I did not hit the top of the flagpole which is apparently required to get the final badge, so I am trying again apparently.
        - **Baldur's Gate 3** is also progressing, if a bit more slowly.
        - I feel like I should at least play a little **Sea of Stars** this week just so I don't forget what's going on in that game. **Xenoblade Chronicles** I care about a bit less.
        - I have installed **Persona 5 Tactica** off of PC Game Pass, but I will probably wait until after I at least finish BG3 before starting it.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. New set *Lost Caverns of Ixalan* dropped on Arena last Tuesday! I haven't had time to stream any drafts, but I did play A TON of them offline. I think I've done like 9 premier drafts so far? Unfortunately none of them have gone particularly well. I keep getting tempted by 5c caves, which I can never get to work!
    - Offline multiplayer: Saturday I went out to UP Town Center for a rare in-person draft day. A friend invited me to their group draft because they needed an eighth. I was happy to oblige; it was my second time drafting with this group now. Luckily I did better than most of my Arena runs: I went 2-1 with a pretty sweet WB draft with fliers and lifegain. I finished 2nd overall in the swiss! (The guy who gave me my one less got first.)

- **Reading**: Almost done with the Daredevil runs. Just need to read some extra books from the *Devil's Reign* event, and then there's like 12 annuals to cover I think. Maybe I can write a new [complete-marvel-run](/tags/complete-marvel-run/) blog post next week? Also caught up a bit on Zdarsky's Batman, a rare foray into DC. Still haven't started any new non-comic books!

- **Watching**: Finished the **Scrubs** binge! Caught up with **Invincible** and **Rick and Morty** and the current season of **The Simpsons** and started with the new **Scott Pilgrim Takes Off** series on the Netflix. Also for some reason I thought last week that the new season of Star Trek Discovery this year, but turns out it was pushed to 2024.

### Walking

Managed to hit 70,336 steps this week, once again hitting my weekly target! Since I was out and about, I had a chance to wander around some commercial areas I hadn't visited in a while: Greenhills Shopping Center and UP Town Center.

### Some Links of Interest

I have no links to share this week (and honestly my to-read backlog has just gotten a lot longer). Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Site Changes

- Nothing this week!
  
### Things I've been thinking about

Dreaming, daydreaming, being angry at surprises, even good ones, repairing broken things, getting away with breaking the rules, mistakes, risk-taking, considering all options, the past and the future all rolled up into one.

During recent weeks, I have found myself recently thinking about whether I should finally break the current sabbatical in 2024, mostly because of the increased family medical expenses from this year (and of course stuff like inflation, etc). But whenever I am writing these weeknotes, it reminds me how much I would have to give up if for example I take full time work again. Just the idea of doing my daily 10,000 steps of walking while also working full-time exhausts me, not to mention other activities I might have to give up. Also, I must admit I am really just enjoying the sabbatical. Might be best to pick up flexible part-time work again first to ease into it? Something to think about further as the year draws to an end.

### Things I'm looking forward to

I think my calender is mostly clear, so I plan to use the week to catch up on things I have fallen behind on, maybe try to stream some drafts again. The trivia team is attending another quiz night, but the categories aren't great for me, so I passed on this one.
