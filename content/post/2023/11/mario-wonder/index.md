### Review

*Super Mario Bros. Wonder* is a fun much-needed refresh of the 2D Mario series, with new sprites and animations to replace ones from the aging *New Super Mario Bros* line. The visual refresh is excellent, as Mario and his party have a lot of new fun animations for even minor actions like running, going into a pipe or passing through a door. They give the game a lot of character.

There are three new power-ups: The Elephant form is the most promoted one, it's fun and also well-animated (and looks hilarious), but not as OP as I thought it'd be. Bubble Flower form is also pretty good. Drill Hat mode seems a lot more situational than the others. And the classic Fire Flower form comes back as well.

The main feature of this release is the Wonder Flower, which you find and activate it in a stage, activates a special "Wonder" mode for the stage that lasts until you find the stage's hidden Wonder Seed. Wonder effects are generally unique, though some repeat a bit throughout the game. They range from wacky to gimmicky to completely changing the rules of how the game works (one of them turns the stage into a top-down 2D game!). 

I did one stream playing the game:

Overall the game is excellent and introduces many different kinds of enemies for Mario and gang to fight. Aside from the titular Mario Bros, there are several other playable characters such as Peach, Daisy, Toad, etc. All of them play the same except for the four colored Yoshis and Nabbit - those guys act as kind of an easy mode and can't take damage from enemies, but they can't get power ups. 

The number of playable characters leads into the fact that multiplayer coop is heavily supported in Mario Wonder. Unfortunately I haven't had occasion to sit down and multiplayer with people yet, so I can't comment on that feature. Maybe someday when the *pamangkins* are good enough.

Another neat new feature is the addition of badges - special items that can give the player special abilities like the ability to float while falling or jump higher or to double jump or increased coyote time (at the expense of constantly running). You can only equip one badge at a time - I just defaulted to parachute hat mostly as it makes my poor platforming better, though I would guess the double jump (spin jump) one is better overall. Most of the badges give positive effects, but there are a few that give handicaps like that terrible terrible invisibility badge (enemies can't see Mario but neither can you!). More on that badge later!

My main major nitpick about the game (and I've read many others mention it) is that aside from exactly two stages, I did not find it especially difficult. That doesn't mean I didn't die a lot (see the video above), but rather I can get through most stages after a few tries. The first challenging stage for me was Special 2, mostly because I am bad at timing Mario's wall jump especially to a beat. 

The second one was the post-game stage, the Final Final Badge Marathon, where you had to get through multiple different segments each with a different badge equipped. It's also quite long and only has two checkpoints with I think 3-4 segments between each one. The most brutal for me was the invisibility badge segment which was the very last one, this took me soooo many tries because you had to coordinate jumps without seeing Mario. It got a lot easier when a friend told me you could just hold jump when bouncing off bouncy surfaces (in previous games you had to time the jump press). Without exaggeration, it took me at least 300 lives to finally finish this one AND land the top of the flagpole at the end (I finished it once without hitting the top before that.) I actually finished the main game something like 3 weeks ago and it took me the last 3 weeks to get through that one stage!

Some minor nitpicks: Wonder effects, while overall fun, I feel like they kind of limited the design of stages since each stage MUST have a wonder effect. Don't get me wrong, the stages we do get are mostly pretty good design-wise and variety in stages was nice, but I kind of felt shortchanged in terms of the number of "traditional" Mario stage designs. The large number of new enemies also meant traditional Mario enemies got much less screen time. For example, we only got one stage that was even close to a Ghost House. 

Given the above, the game also left me wanting more stages, but I guess that's a good thing.

Also, there were a couple of stages that required you to do things to a beat like a rhythm game, which I am notoriously very bad at, so that was annoying.

### Completion

Nintendo doesn't do achievements of course, but the game has 6 "medals" you can earn for various completion tasks throughout the game:

- 1 for finishing the main story (beating Bowser)
- 1 for collecting all the Wonder Seeds
- 1 for collecting all the 10-flower coins (there are 3 in every stage)
- 1 for hitting the top of every flagpole
- 1 for collecting all the badges (can only be completed by beating the final post-game level)
- 1 for collecting all the standees

Standees are items used in multiplier, and you can purchase them from in-game shops using purple flower coins that you collect, and they have a "Gacha"-style system where you don't know which standee you're getting and can get duplicates. You can guarantee a unique pull, but those are more expensive. Unfortunately because I didn't do any multiplayer stuff I didn't bother collecting them. I did not know early on that they need to be collected and probably wasted some purple flower coins being at max capacity a lot of the time (see the video above), so I could not afford to collect them all at the end of the game, so that was the one badge I was unable to collect.

### Overall

I had a lot of fun and the game is an excellent refresh for the 2D Mario series and a good send-off for the Switch if the rumors of a "Switch 2" coming next year are indeed true. Probably my final Switch game for the year too!
