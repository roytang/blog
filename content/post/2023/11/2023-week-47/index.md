title: 2023 Week 47
---

It is now week 47 of 2023, the final week of November!

### The World

The days are getting cooler, though some days the hot afternoon sun still persists.

A rocket has exploded. War crimes continue. Things collapse. Trials move forward apace. Some AI guy was fired and rehired. And yet, the world continues to turn. 

### My Week

This past week was a lot lazier than the previous couple of weeks. I didn't have to go anywhere far this week! I managed to get some progress going on some content re-org on the site, some archiving of old stuff, cleaning up around the house, following-up on medical errands, etc. 

Trivia team attended a Geekfight league game without me and finished second. It was a decent finish, but now the next game is about Genshin Impact and we have no one who can handle that for us!

On the blog: I wrote about [a funny bug I remembered while browsing old chat logs](/2023/11/august-september-bug/) and also a longer piece about [Youtube vs adblockers, apps vs open web](/2023/11/youtube-adblockers/).

I HAVE started cleaning out the extra room. Threw out a bunch of old boxes. There's still a lot of stuff in there though.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - I FINALLY REALLY beat the final **Super Mario Bros Wonder** stage, and I am happy to move on from the game at this point, so I have [written my review](/2023/11/mario-wonder/).
        - **Sea of Stars** and **Baldur's Gate 3** are progressing. Actually I can feel like I can just finish BG3 already if I wanted, but there's a whole bunch of quests I still want to do!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. I played in this weekend's LCI limited Arena Open last night, but did poorly. =/ I did manage to [stream one draft](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cNfxLpmfHs) though. Might try to stream more drafts this week.

- **Reading**: Not a lot of reading this week. I still need to review the *Devil's Reign* event to complete the Daredevil run, so I can write a new [complete-marvel-run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) blog post already? Really should read some new actual books before the end of the year though! Also, my feed reader backlog has been unwieldy all week (currently at 70 items unread), possibly because I added a bunch of feeds to it over the past few weeks.

- **Watching**: Finished **Scott Pilgrim Takes Off**! Still watching **Invincible**, **Rick and Morty**, **The Simpsons**. Also started the second season of **Spy X Family**. No new movies watched this week!

### Walking

Managed to hit 70,177 steps this week, once again hitting my weekly target! I was a bit worried that I would fall short at the end because it was a rainy Saturday, had to take a walk with the umbrella.

### Some Links of Interest

- [Ben Werdmuller: There's no money in free software](https://werd.io/2023/theres-no-money-in-free-software): 
  
    > My take is this: if you want to make money building something, sell it. If you want to release your software as open source, release the bit (or a bit) that doesn’t have intrinsic business value. Use that value to pay for the rest. If you need money to eat and put a roof over your head, do what you need to get money. And then if you want to be altruistic, be altruistic with what you can afford to distribute.

- [Manifesto for posting online in 2023](https://meandorla.substack.com/p/manifesto-for-posting-online-in-2023): 
  
    No. 12: "Let people be wrong about things - about facts, about politics, about you. Leave them to it. Learn to walk away from and let it all go."

- [A Coder Considers the Waning Days of the Craft | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/11/20/a-coder-considers-the-waning-days-of-the-craft): 

    > "But as I write this my wife is pregnant with our first child, due in about three weeks. I code professionally, but, by the time that child can type, coding as a valuable skill might have faded from the world."

    ...

    > "But A.I., as it was being described, seemed different. It provided a lot of help. I worried that it would rob me of both the joy of working on puzzles and the satisfaction of being the one who solved them. I could be infinitely productive, and all I’d have to show for it would be the products themselves."

### Site Changes

- Cleaning up old content on the site, I assume nobody else notices these things but me!
- Nothing on the backend this week! But I have gotten some new ideas for how to approach some of the organization issues I've been thinking about. Might take a while to implement.
  
### Things I've been thinking about

Nostalgia, wandering through the past, despair, changes, collections, worrying about the future, bad thoughts!

### Things I'm looking forward to

Tomorrow is a holiday here. My PH holidays calendar says it is "Day off for Bonifacio Day"; actual Bonifacio Day is on Thursday.

Speaking of Thursday, the trivia team will be attending a quiz night on that day, I believe it will be the last one for the year.

There's a bunch of errands to do next week, but I don't want to think about them yet.
