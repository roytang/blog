Last year I celebrated [Twenty Years of Blogging (More or Less)](/2022/08/twenty-years/). Since then I've found myself noting down whenever I run across a blogging anniversary post, I always enjoy reading them, even though I don't really know the writers. I'm not sure exactly what fascinates me about posts like these, but I like reading about people's personal history of blogging, what tech stacks they've gone through, musings about how things were in the good old days, why they blog and what they've gotten out of the practice. I especially like the ones that have been running for a long time, like a decade or more. It reminds me that even though I've [followed a lot of blogs](/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/) [throughout the decades](/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear-2/), I'm sure I've barely scratched the surface and from then til now there are many many other bloggers out there sharing their thoughts on the internet.

So anyway, link dump incoming, in order of blog age, oldest to youngest:

25 years: David Wertheimer says he has [“One of the world’s oldest continually publishing blogs”](https://netwert.com/ideapad/2023/11/01/one-of-the-worlds-oldest-continually-publishing-blogs/)

20 years: Tracy Durnell's blog, one I've enjoyed reading this year, recently [celebrated 20 years of blogging](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/09/23/my-20th-anniversary-of-blogging/). Late last years so did ["But She's A Girl"](https://www.rousette.org.uk/archives/happy-20-year-blogiversary-to-me/) (I don't know what her name is).

8888 posts: Rubenerd is on [my public blogroll](/page/blogroll/)[^1], and he recently celebrated [a post count-based milestone](https://rubenerd.com/8888-posts/), which I thought was both unusual and fun. That is an insane amount of posts! 

17 years: The Marginalian (formerly Brain Pickings): [17 Life-Learnings from 17 Years of The Marginalian](https://www.themarginalian.org/2023/10/22/17/). Every year the author Maria Popova adds one more life lesson to this list.

13 years: [Pablo Morales](https://lifeofpablo.com/blog/blogging-for-10-plus-years) (found via [Tracy Durnell](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/11/09/reply-to-pablo-cheers-for-thirteen-years-of-blogging/))
