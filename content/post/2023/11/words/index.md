I enjoyed [this interview with iconic NYT crosswords editor Will Shortz](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/will-shortzs-life-in-crosswords).

The interview has insights on modern software construction:

> Crosswords today are so much better than they were even ten years ago, which are better than the puzzles ten years before that. The grids are more interesting and more colorful than ever before. You have less crosswordese and stupid obscurity, and more lively, colorful, juicy vocabulary. You can buy databases now that have been curated for interesting crossword answers, and that downgrade words and answers that are not interesting.

How crosswords changed when he took over:

> The crosswords that were being published by the Times just before I took over were mostly made by older people. So they’re going to reflect older people’s vocabulary, knowledge, and culture. I wanted to keep the older generation of constructors, but I wanted to bring in new ones as well. I think the crossword should reflect the life, language, and culture of everybody who reads the Times, and that’s everybody from smart teens up to the oldest people.
>
> Jack Rosenthal, who hired me—he was the editor of the Sunday magazine at the time—told me that, if any cultural reference appeared in the crossword from the most recent twenty-five years, it came as a shock. Of course, that’s not true anymore. Everything in life basically is fair game for a crossword, and it includes classical subjects you learn in school, like history, literature, geography, up to what’s going on in the world today: music, movies, TV, sports, and changes in language. So that’s one change.

The NYT online crossword archives have puzzles dating back to 1993, the start of Shortz's term as editor and ironically, the ones from that decade are much more challenging for me than modern ones because they have cultural references from the 70s and the 80s - things I was barely aware of as a child.

> One thing that got a lot of notice, which I’ve considered pretty insignificant, was the introduction of commercial names in the puzzle. Before me, if “Oreo” ever appeared in the puzzle, the clue was always “Mountain: combining form,” which is preposterous.

When my friends and I are doing the crossword we always point out which words appear often - Oreo is one of them!

I also liked this list of [words that deserve wider use](https://wordwarriors.wayne.edu/list). Fairly happy that I at least know around 40-50% of these words. I should arrange them into some kind of "word of the day" program and use each one as it comes up. Like, I should refer to my daily walks as "constitutionals".

James Sommers suggests that [you are probably using the wrong dictionary](https://jsomers.net/blog/dictionary):

> Dictionaries today are not written this way. In fact it’d be strange even to say that they’re written. They are built by a large team, less a work of art than of engineering. When you read an entry you don’t get the sense that a person labored at his desk, alone, trying to put the essence of that word into words. That is, you don’t get a sense, the way you do from a good novel, that there was another mind as alive as yours on the other side of the page.

...

> It’s as if someone decided that dictionaries these days had to sound like they were written by a Xerox machine, not a person, certainly not a person with a poet’s ear, a man capable of high and mighty English, who set out to write the secular American equivalent of the King James Bible and pulled it off.

[Robin Rendle agrees](https://robinrendle.com/notes/webster%E2%80%99s-1913/). Both posts cite powerful examples of how a good dictionary can help you punch up your writing. Their recommended version, Webster's 1913 dictionary, is available via a [webapp](https://www.websters1913.com/). 

I should figure out how to incorporate this dictionary into my everyday use - I still find myself just typing "define: word" into my browser's address bar and relying on either Duckduckgo's quick answer, which comes from the American Heritage Dictionary, or a link to the Merriam-Webster site.

Finally, [Wordsmith games' website](https://wordsmithgames.com/) contains a bunch of small word puzzle games. I think they're the kind that refresh daily, but although I've only tried them a few times, one of them said I had a "7 day streak" so IDK if they're polished.
