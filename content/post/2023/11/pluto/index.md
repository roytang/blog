I haven't seen any *Astro Boy*-related media since watching the 1980s anime as a kid. So when I heard about this 2003 manga *Pluto* and the upcoming Netflix anime adaptation, I was pretty intrigued. It's an adaptation of a story arc from the original Astro Boy manga! I binged the eight episode miniseries over the weekend.

First: it's beautifully animated in a more realistic anime style than the original (no gigantic anime eyes here, and Atom wears actual clothes!)

Second: Story-wise, if you were expecting anything close to the style or pacing of *Astro Boy*, you're going to be very surprised. *Pluto* is presented as a slow-burn gritty murder-mystery in a future society where robots have been given rights, a society recovering from a recent war. Instead of Atom, for most of the episodes our protagonist is the robot detective Gisacht as he investigates a series of killings involving those known to be the most powerful robots in the world. 

The story and world-building were so different from what I was expecting that afterwards I found a copy of the original manga story arc so I could compare and the difference is stark. While the main premise of a mystery robot attacking the most powerful robots of the world remains, the original Astro Boy arc was a simple straightforward "Ha ha my robot is the strongest, he'll go beat all these other robots!", typical of a kids' story. The *Pluto* adaptation goes a long way to expand the world and the detail and back story to create a much more compelling narrative that involves questions of robot rights, discrimination, war, and hatred. I am glad I watched Pluto before reading the manga version of the story, given there is a slight twist at the end of the manga story arc that would have foreshadowed a slightly-similar twist in Pluto.

Overall an excellent anime to watch.
