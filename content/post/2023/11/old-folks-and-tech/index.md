I saw the following image a few times online during the past couple of months:

{{% img src="dc19a670e20d10ab.png" %}}

(I tried to find a source for this image and some Twitter posts imply it was probably from [a magazine called Private Eye from the UK](https://private-eye.co.uk/).)

This reminded me of how much our modern world relies on tech which supposedly makes things convenient but actually can leave behind those who are less tech-savvy like older people.

I live with my parents who are both over the age of 70 and are not really that good with technology so I can appreciate the challenges involved with helping old people navigate our modern tech-centered world. My mom used to work with spreadsheets a bit, so she is a bit better at things than my dad, who I am pretty sure does not understand the concept of files. (Although to be fair, [neither do the younger generation raised by mobile phones](https://www.pcgamer.com/students-dont-know-what-files-and-folders-are-professors-say/).)

A recent incident of note: my dad asked me to help him with a problem with his Messenger app, something he could not describe to me with words apparently. When I checked it out, there was a popup dialog where Messenger was asking for a pin to be set to help recover end-to-end encrypted chats, and it would not let him use the app until he set the PIN. This is apparently [a new feature they are gradually rolling out](https://www.facebook.com/help/messenger-app/479091330683112/?helpref=faq_content). The first problem was of course that [people don't read dialog boxes](https://ignorethecode.net/blog/2008/10/31/nobody-reads/) (again, not unique to old people), but I suspect my dad did read the dialog, he just had no idea what it meant. I didn't save the exact wording of the dialog, but in order to understand just the phrase "end to end encryption", my dad would have had to understand concepts like clients and servers and where messages are stored. He doesn't even remember his own app passwords! If he got a new phone and needed to restore his messenger app and messages, he would just ask me to do it. I ended up setting up his PIN myself and saving it somewhere.

Some other things I've had to help him with:

- I had to teach him how to take Youtube videos he's seen on the TV, look for them on his phone, and share to Facebook
- I have to help him register for credit card promos and claim rewards - he uses his credit card a lot and receives messages telling him he's qualified for promos, but he always asks me to handle them
- I have to help him install apps to avail of credit card rewards, gas station promos, etc
- I had to help him find emails that vanished from his inbox because he accidentally composed a draft reply and the app inexplicably moved the entire thread to the drafts folder
- More than once he asked me if I can add a certain movie to Netflix. If only I had that power!

(This list is non-exhaustive, just the ones I can recall as of this writing)

This isn't a dig on my dad - he's a smart fellow who's good at math and can manage older non-software tech like electronics and appliances and VCRs and whatnot. But modern software is too much for him; there's a lot to learn for someone his age. Everything he wants to do takes multiple steps and the software is constantly changing. Even if I gave him a printout of detailed instructions for certain operations, just one app update could make those instructions obsolete. 

Part of the challenge is that unlike me he didn't grow up with all this technology; he really only started to use all of this regularly when the pandemic happened and he was at home most of the time (I don't think they had internet access at their office). This means he doesn't have any instinctive mental model for how all of this works, and most of the time, he doesn't even have the language to describe any issues or what he wants to do. He never uses the term "wall" or "news feed" or "post" when talking about Facebook, he just says "Gusto ko ito ilagay sa [his facebook account name]" (*I want to put this on [his facebook account name]*). He rarely experiments with different software features unless we tell him about them. 

I think about my own mental model for all of this. Even though [I don't use the Facebook app anymore](/2020/06/quitting-facebook/) and it has changed a lot since I last used it, I can still reasonably navigate it and when my dad asks for help, I can poke around to see how it can be done. This is my general approach to unfamiliar software that has a problem: poke around and see what things I can fiddle with.My dad can't do this - the lack of a mental model means he doesn't know where is a good place to poke around, he doesn't know that generally there is a settings menu somewhere, or what kind of things are there typically. And he has bad experiences with software (see the emails example above) that discourage him from randomly trying different things. 

All of this feels to me like a failure in the way we design software: most of the time, we design it for people who already know how to use software in general. We usually don't think about how it affects laypeople who are generally unfamiliar with software. Granted that they are a rapidly dwindling audience, but that doesn't mean they should be shut out of modern systems just because they are not tech savvy.

I don't have any specific suggestions, other than that people who introduce all these new systems should make sure there is always an analog fallback for people who are not comfortable with apps or tech or whatnot. In the comic above, having an app to allow buying tickets wasn't the issue, as that certainly makes it more convenient for a lot of people. The issue was that there wasn't an alternative way to buy tickets, even onsite. And there should always be a way to just talk directly to a human to help you through something. My dad would vastly prefer just to talk to a human to manage his tech issues (most of the time I'm that human!) As companies outsource more of their customer support to automated systems and AI chatbots, this becomes more challenging, as any existing helplines tend to be undermanned and difficult to get through. 

Technology can empower us and make things more convenient, but we have to make sure we aren't leaving the non-tech savvy behind.
