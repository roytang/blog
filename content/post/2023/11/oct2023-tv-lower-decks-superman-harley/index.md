Some TV stuff I finished watching over the past week, coincidentally just animated series today.

### Star Trek: Lower Decks s4

Was looking forward to this season after the excellent crossover in [the recent Strange New Worlds season](/2023/08/strange-new-worlds-s2/). The season was a bit uneven but Lower Decks still provides a decent comedic take on the Star Trek universe. I think I liked this season a bit more than the previous one; lots of deep cuts to old Trek storylines and recurring gags. This time the Lower Decks crew even get promoted, no longer ensigns! They also see some significant character growth, with Mariner coming face to face with her own self-destructive behavior and Boimler finding a chance to display some leadership. Even Tendi's Orion backstory has been expanded significantly! The entire season is tied together with a story arc about attacks on non-federation ships and the eventual reveal of a forgotten (?) character from TNG. While the season had some low points, I think it stuck the landing quite well.

### My Adventures with Superman s1

Heard some good things about this one going in but didn't really know much else. It's very anime-inspired, and even has [a Sailor Moon-esque transformation sequence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ6TcuqkcZU) at some point! It's a different take on the origin story as Clark comes to Metropolis and meets Jimmy and Lois before he ever becomes Superman or has any idea of his true heritage. The trio work as interns at the Daily Planet and try to establish themselves as reporters by investigating mysterious events in the city, giving Clark a chance to discover his powers and explore his history, though he still has very little idea by the season's end. The season's villains are decidedly human, though the threat of Kryptonian invasion is there. Reminds me a bit of Invincible actually, which would be ironic given Invincible is a take on Superman in the first place. Looking forward to how they handle this in the next season.

### Harley Quinn s4

This season sees Harley and Ivy branching out into separate careers on opposite sides of the law while trying to keep their relationship together. It sees them working with different supporting casts then when the season started, though King Shark stays around as a regular, albeit in a smaller role. The season does have a big Lex Luthor world domination plan and the big superhero murder (minor spoiler I guess) so it doesn't pull any punches and swings big. Still one of the best Batman adaptations too date, mostly because of how it parodies the usual super grim and serious Bat family.

### That's it for today

It's my first time in a while batching together reviews like this. It's just that I've been watching a lot of TV over the past few weeks and didn't want to make too many posts. I hoped to include more reviews as there's a bunch of ongoings that are almost finished - notably Loki season 2, but I guess I'll just do another set in November.
