Saw this was on D+ and decided to watch it, since it had garned some Emmy nods a while back. I was kind of expecting a joke-heavy thing, something like B99, but it's more like a like-hearted slice of life show with some absurdity sprinkled in. Good for background watching. Strong *Modern Family* vibes, even has the same mockumentary conceit. This kind of show tends to take a while to ramp up in enjoyment, as you need some time to get attached to the ensemble cast. The first season is short (it came in as a midseason replacement) so I'm not there yet, but I'll gladly give the second season a chance when it comes to streaming.
