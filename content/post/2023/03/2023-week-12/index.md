title: 2023 Week 12
---

March is ending, and the cool amihan winds have left us to our scorching hot days. Summer is truly here.

### My Week

I spent Friday through Monday in Singapore visiting friends. Just arrived early this morning and basically slept all day. These are my excuses for why the weeknotes are coming in very late.

The trip itself deserves it's own post, which I'll try to get around to soon. The rest of my week was prepping and packing and being anxious for the trip, and trying to fit in some errands before being away for a few days. Nothing much of interest. So today's weeknotes are also going to be a bit short probably.

### Media Diet

- **Playing**: 
    - Single player: Before going on my trip, I managed to play a bunch of **Witcher 3** (about to head off to the Isle of Mists) and even made some progress in **Return to Monkey Island**.
    - Online: **Magic Arena** and **Eternal** grinding continued until I went travelling. During the trip, the only gaming I had access to was losing way too much in **Marvel Snap**. 

- **Reading**: I brought a book with me during the trip, but didn't really dig into it. Comics ongoing etc.

- **Watching**: Already into S9 of *The Blacklist*. Watched a couple of movies in cinemas during the weekend trip: [Suzume (2022)](/2023/03/suzume-2022/) and [John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023)](/2023/03/john-wick-chapter-4-2023/).

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of [70,367 steps](/2023/03/110086593483186476/) and burned 25,815 calories (second highest weekly total for the year so far). As usual, I have no idea how accurate the calories burned part is.

Not only are these my highest totals for the year so far, these are the highest numbers since June 2019 (when I was on a US trip)! It's unlikely I can keep that up this week!

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot today:

- [Web fingerprinting is worse than I thought - Bitestring's Blog](https://www.bitestring.com/posts/2023-03-19-web-fingerprinting-is-worse-than-I-thought.html): TIL Firefox has a "resist fingerprinting" flag, but when I enable it websites no longer know I prefer dark mode!

- [How blogs shaped the web | Chase McCoy](https://chasem.co/2023/03/weblogs-as-a-form/): 

- [Why I Decided Not to Do Emrakul, and How We Shipped It Anyway](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/mtg-arena/why-i-decided-not-to-do-emrakul-and-how-we-shipped-it-anyway): Always nice when two of my interests collide - in this case, software dev and #mtg

### This coming week

MTG: March of the Machine previews go full swing this week, looking forward to it! I believe there's also a SOI Remastered Arena Open this weekend, but I'm probably skipping that.

Wrestlemania is this weekend as well!

We have a quiz night on Thursday!

Also, now I have a long backlog of feed reader items to get through!
