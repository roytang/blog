title: Four Days in Singapore
---

Flew to Singapore last Friday the 24th and was there until early morning of Tuesday the 28th. This was the first time I was travelling by air since the pandemic broke out, so I was curious to see for myself how air travel has changed.

The trip was mainly to visit and spend time with the wife and ten-year-old son of a friend who had passed away last year. Most of the time was spent hanging out with them. We spent a lot of time at the ArtScience Musem, the Aquarium at Sentosa, VivoCity and Funan City Center.

Also managed to sneak in a dinner with HS friends, people I haven't seen in person in decades! Lots of great stories and banter. Quite interesting how we are still learning new things and stories about the good old days even up to now.

Overall a fun trip, and probably worth all my dread and anxiety over travelling again.

### Travel Notes

I kept a running note of various observations in Google Keep:

- Citibank credit card can be used overseas without any prep. BPI I needed to notify them about my travel ahead of time.
- Trip to airport super fast due to skyway. Used to be I would need to allot 2-3 hours for travel time to the airport, but the new Skyway cuts that to just under an hour. There's a P299 toll to be paid though.
- You can pay travel tax before checkin. Handy when you arrive at the airport way too early!
- Maybe i should have one of those nice rigid luggages instead of this old softy I still use
- I have eaten at the tapa king at NAIA T3 more than once before
- NAIA free wifi only lasts 2hrs @_@
- No more arrival cards! Both SG entry and PH re-entry now require you to fill up entry forms digitally, so no more trying to find a pen on the plane when they hand you the forms to fill up
- Singapore MTR will never accept nonlocal credit cards for reloading EZLink cards, need bills
- I still really appreciate having good public transpo
- If i turn off my phone while it has no internet connection and turn it on again later, fhe clock will be off until i have data again. Lol I understand why this works logically, it's just that while conserving battery on the trip home I was wondering why time was passing by so slowly.
- I got sat in an exit row for the first time on the way back, and wow, so much legroom! I actually got some sleep!
- People keep asking me if I ran into any troubles at NAIA because of the recent problems. No issues either coming or going. Actually, it feels like in general the processes are more streamlined now than I remember from before, so kudos to the airport people I supppose.
