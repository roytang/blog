### My Week

I visited a friend in the hospital last Thursday, and it wasn't anything life threatening but I noted the visitor rules are still super strict despite the currently low occurrence of COVID in the country. The time frame when visits are allowed is limited to one hour per day, and only one visitor gets to visit each patient (supposedly for a maximum of 15 minutes, but there's no way that's enforceable). While it's inconvenient for the visitors, some of the hospital staff mention it has the added benefit that the hospitals aren't so crowded. Filipinos are super family-oriented so it used to be that visitors would come in groups usually with kids in tow, which would make hallways noisy and messy and I have to agree the relative calm of hospital hallways these days is pretty nice. (I still don't enjoy hospital visits though.)

Some relatives are visiting from abroad and they haven't been here in a while, so last weekend we had a small family reunion of my father's side of the family here at our house. Not everyone invited was able to come, but it still felt a bit chaotic with so many people around. A good time was had by all and of course lots of stories of the halcyon days.

### Media Diet

- **Playing**: 
    - Single player: Still playing **Witcher 3** (doing quests, playing Gwent). Being stuck a lot in **Return to Monkey Island**.
    - Online: Still doing [All Will Be One](/tags/mtgone/) drafting on **Magic Arena**, even managed to sneak in a stream last Saturday. **Eternal**, **Marvel Snap** daily grinding still ongoing. 

- **Reading**: Have not yet started reading any new book, mostly comics.

- **Watching**: Currently into S8 of *The Blacklist*, about halfway through. Also watched a couple of movies: [My Cousin Vinny (1992)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#my-cousin-vinny-1992) and [Shazam: Fury of the Gods (2023)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#shazam-fury-of-the-gods-2023) in the cinema.

### Walking

I thought I'd start logging this data here. This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 65,591 steps (my highest weekly total for the year so far) and burned 25,033 calories (second highest weekly total for the year so far). I have no idea how accurate the calories burned part is.

Every week I try to target beating the previous week's step count and calories total. As I inch closer and closer to 70k steps for the week, this gets progressively harder. @_@

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot today:

- [More like everyone else – Baty.net](https://baty.net/2023/more-like-everyone-else): > I’m wondering if I should become more like everyone else. Should I post “5 Tips to improve your workflow right now!” articles on Medium? Should I be “super excited” to humblebrag about myself on LinkedIn? Should I fire up my Instagram account and splash gaudy “stories” all over it throughout the day? Should I buy some neon background lights and work on an unnecessary 90-second musical intro to my upstart YouTube channel?

- [My first love | The Garden](https://satyrs.eu/garden/2023/03/interstellar/): I really enjoyed Interstellar, and also this very late review of Interstellar

- [Design notes on the 2023 Wikipedia redesign](https://alexhollender.com/wikipedia-2023-redesign): The most interesting parts of this for me were the links to discussions about reverting to the old design. For me the new design is an unqualified win, especially the sidebar TOC!

### This coming week

This coming weekend I am flying out of country for a few days, taking my first foreign trip since the pandemic began. I suffer from some level of [travel anxiety](/2015/11/travel-anxiety/) so before any trip no matter how short always gives me a bit of tunnel vision in that my brain is hyperfocused on prepping for the trip (and worrying), so I find it hard to think about anything else.

Also, next week's weeknotes will likely be a day or so late.
