Notes:

- This limited format was once again a disaster for me. That terrible win rate is my lowest one in the past 2 years! I think most of my drafts were sensible, but the games just didn't come together, so I think there's something about the tempo or vibe of the format that I didn't really get. Sigh. Insert moaning how about I'm still so bad at this game after playing it for decades now.
- Consensus best colors for this format were blue and black a distant second. My stats agree! All other colors were miserable for me.
- I do think the format was very fun and interesting, despite being so bad at it. Battles are an interesting addition to the game and especially to limited, they can really change the flow of a game, easily a home run as a new mechanic/card type.

*Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle Earth* drops next week on Arena! I am not sure how much I want to draft this set since it's not a standard set so I'm not super incentivized to get as much of the set as possible. I do have a significant amount of gold saved up, so I can probably do a bunch of drafts straight out the gate, and hopefully I manage to figure out this format and do better than with March of the Machine!
