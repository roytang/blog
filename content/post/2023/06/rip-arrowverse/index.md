  title: Flash season 9
---

Previously: [Supergirl Finale and What Remains of the Arrowverse](/2021/11/supergirl-finale-arrowverse/)

Finally managed to power through the end of Flash season 9 this past week. This season served as both the series finale and the overall finale for the Arrowverse shared universe. (*Superman and Lois* is still ongoing, but despite its roots, that show has been declared not in-Arrowverse).

The season was okay; the first half story arc (vs Red Death) felt like the usual Flash ridiculousness but the second half was a bit better. The whole Caitlin and Khione character arc felt unnecessary. We got representatives from Arrow and Batwoman and Supergirl showing up as well as old regulars coming back to make an appearance. Sadly, Cisco was unable to make an appearance and we had no Legends representation either. 

Overall the season felt a bit better than the last few seasons of what felt like garbage writing. Out of all the series, The Flash always has these superconvoluted storylines and enemies because of the way his powers work and all the time travel stuff. I guess given how fundamental the Flash legacy is to comic multiverses, it's appropriate for this series to end the Arrowverse.

At least Flash managed to get a decent ending. If it were up to me, I would have ended the Arrowverse shortly after the [Crisis on Infinite Earths crossover](/2020/01/crisis-on-infinite-earths/), giving just enough time for each show to wrap up cleanly. Instead we get Batwoman and Legends randomly cancelled without an opportunity for good endings. 

Despite being plagued by some decidedly weak seasons and overly dramatic or cliched storylines, it still feels like the Arrowverse overall was something special and also something we may never have again. A shared universe developed over 4-6 shows, each with multiple seasons, bringing to life many comic storylines and coming together for epic crossovers, all while hewing to the traditional episodic weekly format with the usual season length typical for network TV. For sure the adherence to network TV conventions is a thing of the past - streaming shows will typically have much shorter seasons and often will not have the weekly cadence. It feels like the end of an era of genre shows the likes of which we will never see again.
