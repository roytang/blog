### Intro

I recently got back my 3DS (technically a New 3DSXL) from my niece who borrows it often for extended periods. I don't really use it these days, but I played a heck of a lot out of it from around 2011 to 2016ish or so. Despite it's age, this 3DS still has all my play data from when I first started playing on it. In the vein of [my post about NES games](/2023/05/nes-games/) I thought I'd extract the play data from the 3DS before something bad happens to the SD card and write reviews about the games I've played on the console. Here we go!

Note: The 3DS doesn't have a native screenshot feature, so I am bringing camera phone shots here.

### The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D

Started playing: 2011/06/24

Finished: 2012/02/17

Total playtime: 44:52

This was my first time playing a 3D Zelda, and this was a classic, one of the highest-rated games of all time. I did not love the experience. [I fell asleep the first time I played it](/2011/06/84972007556517888/). My main issue with the game is that camera control is horrible, which is everything in a 3D game. (I had camera issues with [Super Mario 64](/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/) as well, so I guess this is typical of early console 3D games...) In first person mode, you had to aim using the left stick (the 3DS had no right stick) **and** moving the 3DS adjusted your aim as well, which meant things were so unsteady. This made aiming weapons like the bow and hookshot in the middle of combat very tricky. Also, the water temple was so tedious in this game, but at least in this version you could instantly remove/equip the needed item via the touchscreen (in the original, you had to open the menu every time!) Somehow I powered through and finished the game, but as you can see from my save file, I did not bother with completion.

### Super Mario 3D Land

Started playing: 2011/12/06

Finished: 2012

Total playtime: 68:49

I first finished this sometime in 2011 with just under 30 hours of gameplay. It got a second life when my niece started borrowing my 3DS from 2018-2020, which inspired me to play another run-through of the game. My niece and I put in another 30+ hours in the game during that time. 

This was the first 3D Mario that tried to adapt the level design systems of the 2D Mario games; previous 3D outings (namely [64, Sunshine and Galaxy](/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/)) were more open-world type things. I actually like this style a lot more compared to those games, probably since I grew up with the original 2D Marios, so I'm looking forward to whenever Nintendo releases the next Mario game in this style.

My original save got all the way to 4-Star completion, which means I cleared all the worlds and collected all the Star Medals. Getting to 5-Star completion would have meant completing every world with Luigi and also getting Gold Flags on every level, I guess I did not have the patience for that. It looks like I never finished that second run though. I suspect I may try to continue it in the future since it's actually a pretty good game.

### Tales of the Abyss

Started playing: 2012/02/23

Finished: 2014/01/31

Total playtime: 50:38

Big fan of [the Tales series](/tags/talesof/) but this entry took me so long to finish because the second half had so much walking and backtracking it was so tedious. This was one of the earlier games with the 3D combat so the system wasn't yet super-refined and honestly felt a bit clunky. I did like the character designs, especially for Tear Grants, who is currently still part of my wallpaper rotation (also her full first name is *Mystearica* which is so ridiculous lol). The story was a bit overly complicated, but this happens a lot in the Tales games. Also, I love that the Tales games always had a stats screen somewhere.

### Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition

Started playing: 2011/08/04

Finished: N/A

Total playtime: 23:24

One of the many times I have purchased SF4. I hadn't realized I'd spent so many hours on this version actually. Looks like I mostly played it 2011-2012.

Anyway, this was a nice, portable version of SF4 that you can play on the go. It's fairly comprehensive - it's the complete roster and there are additional modes specific to the 3ds that make the single-player experience better. Which is good because you're not going to get a decent fighting game multiplayer experience on the 3DS. The controls as you'd expect are challenging, but they did add 4 custom tap areas on the bottom screen to which you can assign shortcuts. The in-game stats uses my brother's name (I suppose because he was the owner of our first 3ds?) and indicates that I completed less than 20% of the combo trials, which is typical really. Also this game came with a nice, thick insert/manual with movelists and everything.

### New Super Mario Bros 2

Started playing: 2012/08/22

Finished: 2012/09/15 (estimated)

Total playtime: 34:38

This was... fine? A classic-style 2D Mario. I did enjoy this one, though it got much less playtime than 3D Land. I wasn't really into the game's conceit of collecting as many coins as possible, so maybe that's why I wasn't too enthused about it. I believe that 3rd save file is as complete as one can get? Might revisit it someday.

### Shin Megami Tensei IV

Started playing: 2013/07/19

Finished: 2014/01/19 (estimated)

Total playtime: 57:09

This was my first foray into the main line of *Shin Megami Tensei* games (I had previously only played the related Persona series). Very dark story exploring questions of order and chaos in an alternate hellscape Tokyo populated with demons (that is a typical SMT story actually). The combat system was very challenging; with the "Press Turn" concept, the battle could easily turn against you with a single random crit. I believe this game had at least 3 endings, but I only did one of them, since I didn't feel like a second playthrough (though it looks like I did attempt to start one since one of the saves is "Cycle 2"). [I spent a bit more time with the sequel.](/2022/12/smtv/)

I got some kind of special edition for this one which included a soundtrack CD (I've never used it as I don't have a CD player) and a very thick strategy/design book which was nice.

### The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds

Started playing: 2013/11/22

Finished: [2013/11/24](/2013/11/10152617879693912-0/) (after a mere 3 days?!?)

Total playtime: 19:18

A spiritual sequel to the SNES classic *A Link to the Past*! I didn't realize how short this game actually was, but I think I would consider it my favorite handheld Zelda game and maybe ever overall 3DS game. That it only took me a weekend to finish the game is a testament to how much it devoured me. This was also the closest I got to completion (measured by heart containers) since the very first Zelda game. Unfortunately, I never revisited it after that first run, so I have little memory of details other than it introduced a rental system for the items Link traditionally got from dungeons, which meant you could tackle dungeons in any order and with whatever items you wanted. That and it had a fun "project Link into a wall" mechanic. I'm not sure how much replayability the game has, but I wouldn't mind visiting it again someday (if only I could clear my endless backlogs!)

### To Be Continued

I felt like the NES post was a bit too long, and this one ended up about the same length, so I am splitting it into two. The second part of the list will be published next week!
