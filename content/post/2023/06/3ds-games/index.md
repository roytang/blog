### Super Mario 3D Land

Started playing: 2011/12/06

Finished: 2012

Total playtime: 68:49

I first finished this sometime in 2011 with just under 30 hours of gameplay. It got a second life when my niece started borrowing my 3DS from 2018-2020, which inspired me to play another run-through of the game. My niece and I put in another 30+ hours in the game during that time. 

This was the first 3D Mario that tried to adapt the level design systems of the 2D Mario games; previous 3D outings (namely [64, Sunshine and Galaxy](/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/)) were more open-world type things. I actually like this style a lot more compared to those games, probably since I grew up with the original 2D Marios, so I'm looking forward to whenever Nintendo releases the next Mario game in this style.

My original save got all the way to 4-Star completion, which means I cleared all the worlds and collected all the Star Medals. Getting to 5-Star completion would have meant completing every world with Luigi and also getting Gold Flags on every level, I guess I did not have the patience for that. It looks like I never finished that second run though. I suspect I may try to continue it in the future since it's actually a pretty good game.
