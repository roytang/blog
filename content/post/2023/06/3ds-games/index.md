### The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D

Started playing: 2011/06/24

Finished: 2012/02/17

Total playtime: 44:52

This was my first time playing a 3D Zelda, and this was a classic, one of the highest-rated games of all time. I did not love the experience. [I fell asleep the first time I played it](/2011/06/84972007556517888/). My main issue with the game is that camera control is horrible, which is everything in a 3D game. (I had camera issues with [Super Mario 64](/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/) as well, so I guess this is typical of early console 3D games...) In first person mode, you had to aim using the left stick (the 3DS had no right stick) **and** moving the 3DS adjusted your aim as well, which meant things were so unsteady. This made aiming weapons like the bow and hookshot in the middle of combat very tricky. Also, the water temple was so tedious in this game, but at least in this version you could instantly remove/equip the needed item via the touchscreen (in the original, you had to open the menu every time!) Somehow I powered through and finished the game, but as you can see from my save file, I did not bother with completion.

### Super Mario 3D Land

Started playing: 2011/12/06

Finished: 2012

Total playtime: 68:49

I first finished this sometime in 2011 with just under 30 hours of gameplay. It got a second life when my niece started borrowing my 3DS from 2018-2020, which inspired me to play another run-through of the game. My niece and I put in another 30+ hours in the game during that time. 

This was the first 3D Mario that tried to adapt the level design systems of the 2D Mario games; previous 3D outings (namely [64, Sunshine and Galaxy](/2020/10/mario-3d-all-stars/)) were more open-world type things. I actually like this style a lot more compared to those games, probably since I grew up with the original 2D Marios, so I'm looking forward to whenever Nintendo releases the next Mario game in this style.

My original save got all the way to 4-Star completion, which means I cleared all the worlds and collected all the Star Medals. Getting to 5-Star completion would have meant completing every world with Luigi and also getting Gold Flags on every level, I guess I did not have the patience for that. It looks like I never finished that second run though. I suspect I may try to continue it in the future since it's actually a pretty good game.

### Tales of the Abyss

Started playing: 2012/02/23

Finished: 2014/01/31

Total playtime: 50:38

Big fan of [the Tales series](/tags/talesof/) but this entry took me so long to finish because the second half had so much walking and backtracking it was so tedious. This was one of the earlier games with the 3D combat so the system wasn't yet super-refined and honestly felt a bit clunky. I did like the character designs, especially for Tear Grants, who is currently still part of my wallpaper rotation (also her full first name is *Mystearica* which is so ridiculous lol). The story was a bit overly complicated, but this happens a lot in the Tales games. Also, I love that the Tales games always had a stats screen somewhere.

### Super Street Fighter IV 3D Edition

Started playing: 2011/08/04

Finished: N/A

Total playtime: 23:24

One of the many times I have purchased SF4. I hadn't realized I'd spent so many hours on this version actually. Looks like I mostly played it 2011-2012.

Anyway, this was a nice, portable version of SF4 that you can play on the go. It's fairly comprehensive - it's the complete roster and there are additional modes specific to the 3ds that make the single-player experience better. Which is good because you're not going to get a decent fighting game multiplayer experience on the 3DS. The controls as you'd expect are challenging, but they did add 4 custom tap areas on the bottom screen to which you can assign shortcuts. The in-game stats uses my brother's name (I suppose because he was the owner of our first 3ds?) and indicates that I completed less than 20% of the combo trials, which is typical really. Also this game came with a nice, thick insert/manual with movelists and everything.

### New Super Mario Bros 2

Started playing: 2012/08/22

Finished: 2012/09/15 (estimated)

Total playtime: 34:38

This was... fine? A classic-style 2D Mario. I did enjoy this one, though it got much less playtime than 3D Land. I wasn't really into the game's conceit of collecting as many coins as possible, so maybe that's why I wasn't too enthused about it. I believe that 3rd save file is as complete as one can get? Might revisit it someday.

### Shin Megami Tensei IV

Started playing: 2013/07/19

Finished: 2014/01/19 (estimated)

Total playtime: 57:09

This was my first foray into the main line of *Shin Megami Tensei* games (I had previously only played the related Persona series). Very dark story exploring questions of order and chaos in an alternate hellscape Tokyo populated with demons (that is a typical SMT story actually). The combat system was very challenging; with the "Press Turn" concept, the battle could easily turn against you with a single random crit. I believe this game had at least 3 endings, but I only did one of them, since I didn't feel like a second playthrough (though it looks like I did attempt to start one since one of the saves is "Cycle 2".). ([I spent a bit more time with the sequel](/2022/12/smtv/).)

I got some kind of special edition for this one which included a soundtrack CD (I've never used it as I don't have a CD player) and a very thick strategy/design book which was nice.

### The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds

Started playing: 2013/11/22

Finished: [2013/11/24](/2013/11/10152617879693912-0/) (after a mere 3 days?!?)

Total playtime: 19:18

A spiritual sequel to the SNES classic *A Link to the Past*! I didn't realize how short this game actually was, but I think I would consider it my favorite handheld Zelda game and maybe ever overall 3DS game. That it only took me a weekend to finish the game is a testament to how much it devoured me. This was also the closest I got to completion (measured by heart containers) since the very first Zelda game. Unfortunately, I never revisited it after that first run, so I have little memory of details other than it introduced a rental system for the items Link traditionally got from dungeons, which meant you could tackle dungeons in any order and with whatever items you wanted. That and it had a fun "project Link into a wall!" mechanic. I'm not sure how much replayability the game has, but I wouldn't mind visiting it again someday (if only I could clear my endless backlogs!)

### Bravely Default

Started playing: 2014/03/08

Finished: [2014/04/06](/2014/04/10152879455218912-0/)

Total playtime: 74:04

Times played: 7

Average Play Time: 10:34?!? WTH

Lol, I was surprised with that average playtime value when I was looking over the stats, but I assume it's because the 3DS sleep mode doesn't interrupt a session? Anyway, *Bravely Default* was a great old-school turn-based RPG that reminded me a lot of the earlier *Final Fantasy* games with it's job system and party of four protagonists you could shape as you will. I played the demo for this before it came out and enjoyed it. The game itself took a lot of time (I grinded to level 99!) and there is a bit of clever wordplay in the title screen once you've gotten far enough story-wise. 

My only complaint is that most of the second half of the game (chapters 5-7) was unnecessarily and annoyingly repetitive. (["It's like if FF6 didn't have a World of Ruin"](/2014/05/ch967lj/)). I can understand why it was done story-wise, but wish it would have been implemented better.

### Super Smash Brothers for 3DS

Started playing: 2014/10/22

Finished: N/A / 2015/12/04 (last played)

Total playtime: 38:23

Honestly hadn't realized I spent so many hours with this game. I also had the WiiU version and probably played this once a lot more because at that time I was still working in an office with a bunch of other people who also had 3DSes so it was easy to get a few Smash games in every day. Not that I was ever good at this game mind you - the stats say I won 1 in 19 online battles lol. This was my first ever Smash game that I ever played, is my excuse. But honestly I'm just so used to the flow of Street Fighter-like fighting games that I have no real mental model of how to effectively fight in a game like Smash. I'm sure it was all in good fun though.

The game came with a nice insert/booklet with movelists and stuff. For some reason I also have a soundtrack CD, which [I somehow acquired half a year](/2015/04/10153696293128912/) via Club Nintendo rewards apparently. I purchased exactly one DLC for this game and that was to unlock Ryu as a playable character, because Street Fighter obviously. Despite that, my favorite character to play in this game was Robin.

Anyway, the game was pretty good. I always enjoy games like this that have huge rosters and all, even when I'm bad at them. Even if you didn't have a play group, there was also a lot of single player content to get through, and [you can even have your Amiibos fight](/2015/04/AYMHAAACAAADVHjojLUt_w/). There's minigames and a weird kind of campaign mode with a kind of difficult final boss. Actually, the in-game stats screen is super detailed, with stats/scores/records for each of the different modes and minigames. I had to cut out most of them from the screenshots below. If I was stuck on a desert island, I wouldn't have minded having a 3DS with Smash available.

### The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D

Started playing: 2016/09/26

Last played: 2017/03/26 (Did not finish?)

Total playtime: 33:28

This was the last game I ever purchased for the 3DS; I bought it in [Feb 2015](/2015/02/10153565963313912/) and only got around to playing it a year and a half later. I spent some time on it, but I don't actually remember a lot, aside from the well-known plot of the moon crashing down after 3 days in-game ("Dawn of the Final Day" and all that). I loaded the save I had, and it doesn't look like I had actually finished the game, and I could't find any notes on the matter. I was probably close though, given the playtime. A friend says I would have had a lot of trouble with the final boss since I hadn't collected all the masks, so it was unlikely I finished it.

It's a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, and it pretty much has the same camera issues as that game. I don't think I have the patience to try to play through either of them again.

### Fire Emblem Awakening

Started playing: 2014/09/27

Finished: [2015/01/26](/2015/01/10153527186253912/)

Total playtime: 60:52

This was my first Fire Emblem game! No screenshots for this one, because I merely borrowed a friend's copy for a few months. Fun and challenging tactics gameplay. I think I played it on a difficulty with permadeath enabled (is there any other kind?), so lots of saving and reloading I believe. Looks like [I really got into the story too](/2014/12/550233301764407296/).

### Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth

Started playing: 2015/03/07

Finished: [2017/04/18](/2017/04/848207440461963268/)

Total playtime: 99:00

I borrowed this one too! And it took me two years to finish, much thanks to the person who lent it to me for his patience. A bunch of ending screenshots in the "Finished" link above.

This was a kind of crossover, basically it was the cast of Persona 3 and 4 (both of which I had already finished at this point) getting sent into an alternate reality where they had to crawl some dungeons in the style of *Etrian Oddysey*. I never played the EO series (though I think I tried a demo at some point), but I did love the Persona games and didn't mind spending more time with these characters.

The game itself was very challenging, and in EO style, you had to do the dungeon map-making yourself! (The game gives you the tools for it.) Took me a long time to get through it - I'm not even sure if that 99hr playtime is accurate or I just hit some kind of limit on the 3DS activity log. (It does jibe with [the stats summary Nintendo sent me years later](/2022/02/1493818986571526146/) though.)

### Backlog / Misc

#### Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked

I believe this was my one and only full game eShop purchase - I did not have a lot of confidence in Nintendo keeping up a store for a long time. This was a Tactics-style SMT game, but I never really got too far with it. Activity log says I only have 5 hours of playtime. Seems unlikely, but I might be able to get back to it someday?

#### Xenoblade Chronicles 3D

I got this [back in Apr 2015](/2015/04/10153696293128912/) but never got around to actually playing it, opting to play through and finish [Xenoblade Chronicles X on WiiU instead](/2016/12/review-xenoblade-chronicles-x/). I'm still kind of hoping I can get back to it at some point. However, at this point it has been in my backlog so long [a new remaster has already come out](/2020/05/1262528940536549377/)!

#### Pokemon X

Started playing: 2014/03/29

Last played: 2022/09/24 (Unfinished?)

Total playtime: 42:14

I got this game for free due to some promotion. That 42h of playtime is nontrivial, but I've never actually played this game myself. All of that playtime is from my niece when she borrows my 3DS. She has been playing this game for at least 8 years and still hasn't finished it! She was like 5yo when she started too! Maybe she'll get there someday!

#### StreetPass Mii Plaza

Total playtime: 33:35

Lol this isn't really a game in the usual sense, but I spent so many hours in this app I thought I'd list it here anyway. Most of those hours were just gathering Streetpasses and putting together those puzzle things! Sadly, Streetpasses are super rare nowadays.

#### The Legend of Zelda

Yes, the original game. This was [the first actual game I finished on the 3DS](/2011/10/120417058184892416/), since my 3DS came with the ambassador privilege that had free NES/SNES games. I wrote [a "review" for this one](/2023/05/nes-games/#15-legend-of-zelda-nes) recently.
