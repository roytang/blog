title: 'Books: Pyramids by Terry Pratchett (Discworld #7)'
---

**Pyramids** is Discworld book 7, finished reading this last night! It covers the desert kingdom of Dyelibeybi, fashioned after the pyramid-building empires of the pharoahs of Egypt. The name of the kindgom amuses me because there was a certain period in my country's history when that was the typical way foreign words would be localized. Apparently, this one is not part of any larger subseries.

It's a rather short book, even for a Discworld, but it still took me about the same time to read, which tells me I didn't find it as engaging as the other ones. Usually after I cross the halfway point of a Discworld book, I kind of power through and sprint to the end to see what's going to happen. Here... not so much. The focus is more on the kingdom of Dyelibeybi rather than any of the characters, who I found rather bland, except maybe for the handmaiden Ptraci. It's still a well-written clever parody, just that the actual plot did not grab me that much. I did enjoy the concept of a physical location folding itself across dimensions by ninety degrees, but that sort of thing might be a bit too abstract for most people.

I am once again out of physical Discworld books to read. This brings us to [17/41 Discworld](/page/discworld/) books read!
