title: 2023 Week 22
---

The first week of June was a little bit rainy, though not as much as a supertyphoon would have brought. I think PAGASA already declared an official start to the rainy season?

### My Week

The week was a bit busy. Last week's weeknotes came late because I was busy through Monday. Tuesday had to get some errands done and had to help my parents prep for a long trip to the province. Got a bit of a respite in the middle of the week, but had more activities Friday and Saturday.

Wrote about how [you can write about anything](/2023/06/write-anything/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of *Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*. The Switch says I have played it for "85 hours or more", which is surprisingly only 15 hours more than last week's estimate. I guess I really did manage to temper my play time!
    - Online: 
        - I tried to hit Mythic rank in **Magic Arena**, but fell short by a couple of ranks. 
        - I am a bit down on **Marvel Snap**, mostly because I am already series 3 complete and that means I don't get new cards very often when climbing collection level, and that makes playing much less exciting. (I can still get variants, but I care very little for cosmetics!) It is unlikely I hit infinite again, I am so far. 
        - **Eternal** is a bit neglected, but I try to sneak it in every so often. 
        - **Street Fighter VI** came out last week! I preordered the Standard edition from Steam, but so far have only gotten tutorials and placement matches done (I landed in Silver, which I guess isn't too bad?). Then over the weekend, a friend randomly gifted me a PS4 copy as well! (I don't even use my PS4 much anymore!) 
    - Also played [some boardgames with friends](/2023/06/boardgames/)!

- **Reading**: Started reading another Discworld! A short one this time, so hopefully can be done soon. Reading a lot of comics still; current reading of Avengers v1 is up to #128 (not a great pace). Feed reader backlog is at a manageable 44 items.

- **Watching**: Only one movie watched this week, it was [The Mummy (1999)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#the-mummy-1999). My brother and I were planning to watch the Spider-verse sequel this past weekend, but he had to resched so hopefully we get to it this week, the reviews are so good! And there's also so many shows I want to watch/finish!

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 69,879 steps and burned 25,204 calories. This is the first time I have fallen short of 70k steps in 2 months! And it was mostly because of an unexpected rain shower. It's probably fine, since I was up 2k steps last week.

### Some Links of Interest

Huh, nothing this week actually. Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This coming week

Surprisingly I have nothing special on the calendar this coming week. Hopefully that lets me get back into my daily routines and get some stuff back on track! 

Next weekend is a long weekend, with PH independence day on Monday the 12th.
