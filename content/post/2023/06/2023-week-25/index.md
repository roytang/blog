### The World

The world has certainly had a week.

Early on the week, there was some drama about a submersible with rich people going missing while visiting the wreck of the titanic. After a few days of rescue efforts, they are presumed dead from the probably shoddily-built submersible (built by what seems to be a shady company) imploding and instantly killing them. But the weirdest thing about this whole drama for me was that they were using a Logitech F710 wireless controller to control the submersible, [the same controller I've been using for PC gaming since 2014](/2014/06/10153045324368912-0/)!

Aside from the sub imploding, Russia threatened to implode this weekend as well, with the leader of the Wagner mercenary groups marching on Moscow. The coup was over very quickly though, apparently through some kind of negotiated deal, and the Wagner leader is retreating to Belarus.

Over in gaming, Nintendo had a direct with a bunch of announcements and let me tell you I am absolutely excited to hear about [a new 2D Mario game coming out later this year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JStAYvbeSHc). *Super Mario Bros. Wonder* looks especially fun and trippy and I am looking forward to this unscheduled new game purchase. This adds to an already overloaded year with soooo many new games to play. It's like the game companies don't want me working on my backlog @_@ Kind of a good problem to have I suppose.

Also, Elon "Twitter" Musk and Mark "Meta" Zuckerberg are setting up some sort of cage match. This is just the kind of reality we live in now.

### My Week

Our weather over here has been relatively pleasant. A bit of rains mostly in the afternoons, and the mornings are starting to get a bit less hot.

For me personally it was a bit of an exhausting week physically. Had to go out a few times, wait in a hospital lab for what felt like an eternity, got my feet sore from walking around too much, and so on and so forth.

For some reason or another I found myself reading through my own [blog archives](/archives/) from the early aughts (around 2002-2008 or so) and I found myself really missing that era of blogging. All my posts seemed so earnest and open and unfiltered, especially in the early years. I wrote long movie and game reviews and commented on current events and shared links and all that. I still do all of those things but I think to a lesser degree these days. I kind of want to see if I can find my way back to where I was back then, blogging-wise?

Trivia team [attended another quiz night this past week](/2023/06/popquiz-pride/). We almost won!

The site's backend has never been super performant - I often get alerts about using too much memory. But it has been happening more frequently during the past few months for some reason. It doesn't look like I am getting any unusual traffic, so my main suspect at the moment is the git integration, since [the backing git repo](https://github.com/roytang/blog) is actually quite large and has a lot of files. As a stopgap measure I have reduced the frequency of how often the backend syncs and updates git and that seems to have helped for now at least. (The only real effect is that I will have to wait longer for updates to reflect on the site.) I really should allot some time to dig into the site's performance issues at some point though.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I've stopped checking how many hours I've put into **Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**. I still haven't pulled the trigger on the final boss because I still keep randomly trying to do all the things the game gives you to do.
    - Also started playing **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War** because some friends were playing it and I found I can play it via PC game pass. The 3D camera in this game is giving me a bit of dizziness though, so I'm not sure if I'll push it further.
    - Wrote part 2 of [3DS games retro reviews](/2023/06/3ds-games-2/)
    - Online: 
        - New **Lord of the Rings** set has dropped on **Magic Arena!**. I haven't managed to do any drafts yet, just a single sealed that ended with a poor 2-3 record. Hopefully can stream some drafts this week. In the meantime, [my Magic Arena stats for the last set](/2023/06/mtgmom-limited-recap/#magic-arena-stats) have come in.
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Have been starting to get bored with the game, but there's some planned changes to card acquisition in the coming months which might make things better.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week still.
        - **Street Fighter VI**: still going through the characters one at a time. Basically doing character guides and combo trials and placement matches for each one, but I don't really have time to play each day so progress is slow. I should probably also start World Tour mode soon so I can do Avatar battles already?

- **Reading**: Started reading another Discworld book but haven't gotten too far in yet. Still reading a bunch of old comics, a bit more than halfway through Avengers v1 at the moment. Feed reader backlog is at a manageable 31 items.

- **Watching**: Went out to the cinemas to watch The Flash (2023) last Thursday. Here's [my review](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2023/#the-flash-2023). Still catching up with current series on TV. First episode of Secret Invasion has dropped; I initially thought I'd save up the episodes before binging them all at the end, but then the internet almost immediately gave me spoilers so I just watched it already. Also, I should probably start on the new season of *Strange New Worlds* as well.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,233 steps and burned 25,592 calories. For some reason, Thursday and Friday's walks left my feet hurting and my legs kind of sore and so by Friday evening I was thinking to myself that I should listen to my body telling me it was hurting. To that end, I planned to break the streak of 70k-average weeks and take Saturday off from my daily walks and just resuming next week. But then I woke up Saturday morning and had the energy for a longish morning walk and I ended up still hitting 70k anyway, so we live to fight another day.

### Some Links of Interest

- [Comic: Goodnight Phone](https://www.theverge.com/c/23558791/goodnight-phone-comic-interactive-gina-wynbrandt): Interactive comic about our modern dystopia

Okay, not a lot today. Honestly I've been saving a bunch of links to read and just haven't had time to get through them. Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This coming week

- Nothing scheduled I think. Hopefully will be a chill week!
