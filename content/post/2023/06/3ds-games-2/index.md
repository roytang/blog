Lol, I was surprised with that average playtime value when I was looking over the stats, but I assume it's because the 3DS sleep mode doesn't interrupt a session? Anyway, *Bravely Default* was a great old-school turn-based RPG that reminded me a lot of the earlier *Final Fantasy* games with it's job system and party of four protagonists you could shape as you will. I played the demo for this before it came out and enjoyed it. The game itself took a lot of time (I grinded to level 99!) and there is a bit of clever wordplay in the title screen once you've gotten far enough story-wise. 

My only complaint is that most of the second half of the game (chapters 5-7) was unnecessarily and annoyingly repetitive. (["It's like if FF6 didn't have a World of Ruin"](https://www.reddit.com/r/3DS/comments/24oij1/comment/ch967lj/)). I can understand why it was done story-wise, but wish it would have been implemented better.

### Super Smash Brothers for 3DS

Started playing: 2014/10/22

Finished: N/A / 2015/12/04 (last played)

Total playtime: 38:23

Honestly hadn't realized I spent so many hours with this game. I also had the WiiU version and probably played this once a lot more because at that time I was still working in an office with a bunch of other people who also had 3DSes so it was easy to get a few Smash games in every day. Not that I was ever good at this game mind you - the stats say I won 1 in 19 online battles lol. This was my first ever Smash game that I ever played, is my excuse. But honestly I'm just so used to the flow of Street Fighter-like fighting games that I have no real mental model of how to effectively fight in a game like Smash. I'm sure it was all in good fun though.

The game came with a nice insert/booklet with movelists and stuff. For some reason I also have a soundtrack CD, which [I somehow acquired half a year](/2015/04/10153696293128912/) via Club Nintendo rewards apparently. I purchased exactly one DLC for this game and that was to unlock Ryu as a playable character, because Street Fighter obviously. Despite that, my favorite character to play in this game was Robin.

Anyway, the game was pretty good. I always enjoy games like this that have huge rosters and all, even when I'm bad at them. Even if you didn't have a play group, there was also a lot of single player content to get through, and [you can even have your Amiibos fight](/collections/miiverse/aymhaaacaaadvhjojlut_w/). There's minigames and a weird kind of campaign mode with a kind of difficult final boss. Actually, the in-game stats screen is super detailed, with stats/scores/records for each of the different modes and minigames. I had to cut out most of them from the screenshots below. If I was stuck on a desert island, I wouldn't have minded having a 3DS with Smash available.

### The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D

Started playing: 2016/09/26

Last played: 2017/03/26 (Did not finish?)

Total playtime: 33:28

This was the last game I ever purchased for the 3DS; I bought it in [Feb 2015](/2015/02/10153565963313912/) and only got around to playing it a year and a half later. I spent some time on it, but I don't actually remember a lot, aside from the well-known plot of the moon crashing down after 3 days in-game ("Dawn of the Final Day" and all that). I loaded the save I had, and it doesn't look like I had actually finished the game, and I could't find any notes on the matter. I was probably close though, given the playtime. A friend says I would have had a lot of trouble with the final boss since I hadn't collected all the masks, so it was unlikely I finished it.

It's a direct sequel to Ocarina of Time, and it pretty much has the same camera issues as that game. I don't think I have the patience to try to play through either of them again.

### Fire Emblem Awakening

Started playing: 2014/09/27

Finished: [2015/01/26](/2015/01/10153527186253912/)

Total playtime: 60:52

This was my first Fire Emblem game! No screenshots for this one, because I merely borrowed a friend's copy for a few months. Fun and challenging tactics gameplay. I think I played it on a difficulty with permadeath enabled (is there any other kind?), so lots of saving and reloading I believe. Looks like [I really got into the story too](/2014/12/550233301764407296/).

### Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth

Started playing: 2015/03/07

Finished: [2017/04/18](/2017/04/848207440461963268/)

Total playtime: 99:00

I borrowed this one too! And it took me two years to finish, much thanks to the person who lent it to me for his patience. A bunch of ending screenshots in the "Finished" link above.

This was a kind of crossover, basically it was the cast of Persona 3 and 4 (both of which I had already finished at this point) getting sent into an alternate reality where they had to crawl some dungeons in the style of *Etrian Oddysey*. I never played the EO series (though I think I tried a demo at some point), but I did love the Persona games and didn't mind spending more time with these characters.

The game itself was very challenging, and in EO style, you had to do the dungeon map-making yourself! (The game gives you the tools for it.) Took me a long time to get through it - I'm not even sure if that 99hr playtime is accurate or I just hit some kind of limit on the 3DS activity log. (It does jibe with [the stats summary Nintendo sent me years later](/2022/02/1493818986571526146/) though.)

### Backlog / Misc

#### Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked

I believe this was my one and only full game eShop purchase - I did not have a lot of confidence in Nintendo keeping up a store for a long time. This was a Tactics-style SMT game, but I never really got too far with it. Activity log says I only have 5 hours of playtime. Seems unlikely, but I might be able to get back to it someday?

#### Xenoblade Chronicles 3D

I got this [back in Apr 2015](/2015/04/10153696293128912/) but never got around to actually playing it, opting to play through and finish [Xenoblade Chronicles X on WiiU instead](/2016/12/review-xenoblade-chronicles-x/). I'm still kind of hoping I can get back to it at some point. However, at this point it has been in my backlog so long [a new remaster has already come out](/2020/05/1262528940536549377/)!

#### Pokemon X

Started playing: 2014/03/29

Last played: 2022/09/24 (Unfinished?)

Total playtime: 42:14

I got this game for free due to some promotion. That 42h of playtime is nontrivial, but I've never actually played this game myself. All of that playtime is from my niece when she borrows my 3DS. She has been playing this game for at least 8 years and still hasn't finished it! She was like 5yo when she started too! Maybe she'll get there someday!

#### StreetPass Mii Plaza

Total playtime: 33:35

Lol this isn't really a game in the usual sense, but I spent so many hours in this app I thought I'd list it here anyway. Most of those hours were just gathering Streetpasses and putting together those puzzle things! Sadly, Streetpasses are super rare nowadays.

As an indication of how uncreative I am, the only thing I did with my Mii was to put a pirate hat on him.

#### The Legend of Zelda

Yes, the original game. This was [the first actual game I finished on the 3DS](/2011/10/120417058184892416/), since my 3DS came with the ambassador privilege that had free NES/SNES games. I wrote [a "review" for this one](/2023/05/nes-games/#15-legend-of-zelda-nes) recently.

### Outro

Whew, still a lot of words, but that should be it. My main takebacks from putting this together is (a) I really enjoyed the 3DS era even though I only spent [652 hours](/2022/02/1493818986571526146/resource/1493818986571526146_2_FLsbyVSUYAo3Xil.jpg/details/) total with it; and (b) there's a bunch of these games I wouldn't mind revisiting, if only I had more time. (The perpetual lament of those with too many backlogs.)

I am thinking of doing a similar set of "retro review" posts for my PS3 games, which in theory I could reconstruct from achievement lists. The eventual goal would be to have my entire play history up on this site, although the SNES/PS1/PS2/NDS era would be challenging to find data on. We shall see!
