title: 2023 Week 23
---

Today, the 12th of June, is the 125th anniversary of the country's declaration of independence from Spain. The perennial question during these observances is always: Have we ever really been free? At least we have a long weekend.

We made the transition to the rainy season quickly; the past week was marked by random rainshowers for most of the week. Yet somehow the days often still feel hot! It also makes the daily walks much more challenging. 

My week wasn't too interesting. mostly stayed at home. Some errands, some side project work. We were supposed to visit family this weekend, but the weather made some of us a bit sick so the meetup was cancelled.

Some new game announcements this week. Things I'm excited about personally: Persona 3 remake coming out early next year! Oh, and I didn't realize Starfield was also coming out later this year, 2023 is so packed. I think Sony had a conference last week, but there was nothing too interesting there for me because I don't have a PS5 (yet?). A lot of the XBox announcements also say they are coming to Game Pass day one, I am hoping that includes PC game pass!

Things happening I'm not particularly interested in: Trump indicted on federal charges; Apple announces some mixed reality thing?

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of **Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom**. The Switch says I have played it for "110 hours or more", and I am starting to get a little bit tired of it, but there's just so much to do! Am considering trying to finish the main quest this week, then leave the remainder of completion to be done in my spare time. I love the game, but there's a lot of other stuff I want to play too!
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue. Ranks were so bad last month.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week.
        - **Street Fighter VI** has been challenging. I am doing so poorly online! The flow of each match feels so different compared to SFV and I'm still not used to reacting quickly to things like Drive Impact, etc. Have tried a few different characters so far and not yet settled on a main. Might try to stream this at some point, but maybe only when I'm comfortable enough with it.

- **Reading**: Close to finishing the current Discworld book, progress has been slow. Reading a lot of comics still; current reading of Avengers v1 is up to #168 (not a great pace). Feed reader backlog is currently at a manageable 67 items.

- **Watching**: Finally managed to watch [Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2024/#spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-2023) this week, loved it! Also powered through the final season of *The Flash*, [RIP Arrowverse](/2023/06/rip-arrowverse/).

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,198 steps and burned 25,092 calories. Walking this week has been very challenging because of the weather - random rainshowers mean if I want to take longer routes it's not practical to wear sandals like I often do, I need to put on shoes and socks, so there's more friction involved (not to mention trying to fight off laziness/inertia.) I suspect I am in danger of breaking my average of 70k steps per week soon!

    > "we reflexively overindulge in entertainment and other low-second-price pleasures –- phone apps, streaming services, and processed food — even though their rewards are often only marginally better than doing nothing. This stuff is attractive because it takes little effort (and we’re tired from working to pay for so many first prices) but it can eat up a ton of time, depleting the second-price budget even further."

### This coming week

I think new Batman, er, Flash film is out this week? Although I suspect we're not watching that one immediately. And also the next season of Strange New Worlds kicks off! Other than that, not much else.
