### Previously

This is part 4.1 [^1] in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and catalog the effort in blog posts. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). I am tackling the older/longer series first, and going in "MCU Order", but now I'm also doing these "side mission" posts [^2] to cover series/runs that I have mostly already read prior to starting this effort. The [previous main entry was about Thor v1](/2023/05/marvel-run-4-thor-etc/#dark-web-2023). 

Actually, most of this entry was originally planned to be included in the Thor v1 post, but it was already far too long, so it gets to be the first "side mission" content instead.

*(Note: All volume nos. are based on [the Wikipedia listings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(B%E2%80%93C)#C))*

### Jason Aaron's Thor run

From around 2013 to 2019, Jason Aaron was *the* Thor guy at Marvel, a long run that introduced many exciting new elements to the God of Thunder's mythos (some of which would be adapted for the MCU in *Love and Thunder*), quite possibly the best modern Thor run so far. The only annoying thing is how many volumes it was split into.

#### Thor: God of Thunder (2013)

Volume length: 25 issues. Part of the 2012 *Marvel Now!* relaunch, this volume introduced several new concepts and characters that would be recurrent during Aaron's run, such as Gorr the God Butcher (horribly underused in *Love and Thunder*), a young viking era pre-Mjolnir Thor, and a far future King Thor, All-Father of Asgard. This volume features fantastic interior art by one of my favorite artists at the time, Esad Ribic.

#### Thor v4 (2014)

Volume length: 8 issues

This short volume takes place in the wake of the *Original Sin* crossover when Thor became unworthy and thus lost access to Mjolnir. It covers the mysterious appearance of a new female wielder of Mjolnir calling herself Thor; at the end of the volume her identity is finally revealed as Thor's former lover Jane Foster, now affected by cancer. I was a big fan of the new Thor's design and used it for a [sketchdaily](/tags/sketchdaily) back in the day:

#### Mighty Thor v2 (2016) and v3 (2017-2018)

Volume length: 23 issues + 7 issues

This volume covers Jane's time as Thor, while the original Odinson is off doing... other things. For me, this volume is characterized by the gorgeous art of Russell Dauterman and colors by Matthew Wilson. The spreads are always so good!

{{% collections-embed comics 179094590332 %}}

{{% collections-embed comics 181334735548 %}}

The primary threat in this volume is Malekith the Accursed, as he prepares for his *War of the Realms*. Thor assembles the League of Realms to hunt Malekith down. Towards the end of the volume, Malekith unleashes the Mangog and Jane is forced to sacrifice Mjolnir by hurling it and Mangog into the sun, giving up her identity as Thor in the process. Jane's cancer claims her, but she hesitates at the gates of Valhalla, refusing to die; Odin and Thor Odinson combine their powers to bring her back to life.

This is two volumes because they decided to renumber when legacy #700 rolled around, but that didn't last long.5

#### Unworthy Thor (2016)

Volume length: 5 issues4

This one was new to me (only read it for this post). A side story about what Odinson was up to while Jane was off being Thor. A limited series with fantastic art by one of my favorite artists, Oliver Coipel.

A Mjolnir from a dead universe (the former Ultimate Universe!) has survived the Secret Wars and landed on Asgard. With the help of Beta Ray Bill, Odinson faces off against the Collector and Thanos who both want the hammer for themselves. In the end, Thor refuses to pick up the hammer, saying it belongs to another Thor. Also, this is where Thor and Thori first meet!

#### Thor v5 (2018)

Volume length: 16 issues + 1 annual

A short volume by Jason Aaron and Mike del Mundo covers Thor (Odinson this time) and his attempts to prepare for Malekith's War of the Realms and compensate for the loss of Mjolnir. Mainly with new hammers. Lots of hammers.

{{% collections-embed comics 181567817410 %}}

#### King Thor (2019)

Volume length: 4 issues

A sort of epilogue to Aaron's Thor run, it reunites Aaron and Esad Ribic in a story about the far future King Thor and his efforts to stand defiant against the inevitable death of the universe.

### The War of the Realms (2019)

This crossover event served as the culmination of Aaron's Thor run, having been foreshadowed as far back as Jane's first reveal as Thor. Malekith's War of the Realms has been brewing in the background for a while, but in this crossover it finally comes to Midgard, the last realm to fall!

I read the main event book for this back in the day, but skipped all the side books, as is typical. So I read them all over the past month and a half! There's quite a lot. As usual for events, I cover only the titles specific to the event; tie-in issues from other ongoings will count when I review those ongoings.

All event-specific titles:

- War of the Realms #1-#6
- War of the Realms Omega #1
- Giant-Man #1-3
- War of the Realms: Journey into Mystery #1–5
- War of the Realms: New Agents of Atlas #1–4
- War of the Realms: Punisher #1–3
- War of the Realms: Spider-Man & the League of Realms #1–3
- War of the Realms Strikeforce: The Dark Elf Realm #1
- War of the Realms Strikeforce: The Land of Giants #1
- War of the Realms Strikeforce: The War Avengers #1
- War of the Realms: Uncanny X-Men #1–3
- War of the Realms: War Scrolls #1–3

Total: 34 issues

The main event book has fantastic art by Dauterman and Wilson, and features the invasion of Midgard, drawing in all of Earth's heroes in its defense. Thor has been shanghai'ed off to one of the other realms, so Lady Freya takes command of the resistance and divides Earth's heroes into 3 strike forces: one to venture into the Dark Elf realm to take control of Malekith's Black Bifrost which facilitates his invasion, one to venture into Jotunheim to bring back Thor Odinson whose might is needed to defeat Malekith, and one to defend Midgard itself agains the invaders. Things take a turn for the worse when Malekith takes Venom's symbiote and uses it to manifest All-Black the Necrosword. In the end, Malekith sets up a trap that only Thor can penetrate. To overcome Malekith, Thor needs the help of three other Thors prominent during Aaron's run - young Thor, King Thor and even Jane Foster temporarily takes up a hammer again. In the final battle, Thor Odinson manages to reforge Mjolnir to defeat Malekith once and for all.

I won't discuss all the side story issues, but some highlights for me:

- New Agents of Atlas

    Okay, I will admit I mostly enjoyed this one because it introduced Wave, who hails from Cebu here in the PH. It brings together Asian superheroes (many of them also introduced in this series) to defend Asia against Surtur's daughter Sindr.

    {{% photos newaoa3 %}}

- Giant-Man

    IDK, the premise of this was just hilarious for me. Under orders from Freya, Scott Lang gets together with a team of superheroes who can go giant-size to go undercover and infiltrate territory held by Frost Giants, in an attempt to locate and assassinate the OG Frost Giant Ymir. Oh, and Scott is looking for Cassie. It's just great that they have to change their skin color (to look like Frost Giants) and generally try to blend in, at which they fail spectacularly a few times.

- Spider-Man

    Okay, I just really enjoyed having Spider-Man interact with all the Asgard stuff. His antics are covered in the main book, *Strikeforce: The Land of Giants* and *Spider-Man and the League of Realms*

    {{% photos spiderman %}}

- Daredevil as guardian of the Bifrost

    For some reason, Heimdal got blinded and could no longer do his duties as guardian of the Bifrost, so Daredevil takes over and gains godlike senses, becoming a crucial part of logistics and coordination for the resistance effort. His adventures are mostly covered in the main book and in *War Scrolls*

Overall the event feels super epic in scale and I re-read and enjoyed the main book much more this time since I followed the recommended reading order and read through all of the side stories first. It's usually difficult to do this while the event itself is running because it can get confusing! A worthy finish to Aaron's epic Thor run.

### Jason Aaron's Avengers run

*Avengers v8 (2018)* #1-#66, *Avengers Forever* #1-#15, *Avengers 1,000,000 BC*, *Avengers Assemble Alpha*, *Avengers Assemble Omega*

Total: 84 issues

While I was a big fan of his Thor run, Aaron's Avengers run was a bit meh for me. He tried to shoot for some epic stuff, but most of the crisis they faced were not really that interesting for me (especially the vampire stuff, the whole Avengers of the past thing, etc). Overall the run just wasn't exceptional for me, and I didn't like the art too much. (I will cover what I do think are some excellent Avengers runs in the future, hopefully!)

Things I did like: The Avengers being based in the corpse of a dead Celestial. The big important role for Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes). The final culminating arc with the multiversal Avengers and the multiversal Masters of Evil and the army of Mephistos. Aaron also got to reuse some elements of his Thor run here, such as King Thor's grand-daughters (the Girls of Thunder!).

This run also had an annual, but it was not done by Jason Aaron and was part of a separate story arc, so I guess I will cover it elsewhere.

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 89 (Thor) + 34 (War of the Realms) + 84 (Avengers) = 292 issues.

Total issues covered so far: 1,882 + 292 = 2174

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 33,629

Progress: 6.4%

Well, we hardly made a dent in the progress bar (<1% added), but it's something, especially given how the target is always moving! This first "side mission" post still ended up quite long although covering less issues than the "main" posts. It will take some iteration for me to find a good cadence/rhythm to balance the amount of stuff I want to cover and the frequency of the posts and my desire to up the progress bar as quickly as possible. I don't want these comic book posts to dominate this blog after all!

### What's Next

Ongoing: Avengers v1, currently up to around #90 I think, so a bit less than 25% done, and I am covering annuals this time as well.

For the next "side mission" posts, will most probably do either *Amazing Spider-Man* or some 90s X-Men stuff maybe?

[^1]: I will keep up with this arbitrary numbering system for as long as I can manage; it feels very on-brand for the comic book world!
