title: 2023 Week 19
---

Midway through May now, and we are starting to get a bit more rain. Unfortunately that also means the humidity makes the heat even worse a lot of the time. Evenings are pleasant though!

### My Week

- It's been another 3 months since the last spate of medical errands so we were due and we got a lot of them this week. For the curious, the sort of errands I am involved in are stuff like assisting my parents with teleconsults, going with them to get tests done or going out to buy meds or doing my own regular checkups; I did all of these this past week! My numbers are pretty good, all things considered.
- Managed to visit [my favorite park](/2023/05/Cr_KoiFP7wf/) after a while.
- Wrote [a very long blog post](/2023/05/nes-games/) about NES/Famicom games.

### A Photo I Took

{{% img src="20230513_160348.jpg" %}}

I took this photo because I was wondering what the story behind it was. The button is above the urinal, so it's not like people could have been pressing it with their foot!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Some more *Witcher 3*, mostly achievement hunting. My [Tears of the Kingdom copy](/2023/05/110353768772670760/) got delivered last Friday, and as of this writing (<48h later) I am probably around 12h in already. I am considering just ceding wwhatever productivity I have for the remainder of the month to this game.
    - Online: **Magic Arena**, **Eternal** and **Marvel Snap** daily grinding continue as usual. Managed to do a bit better in [March of the Maching drafting](/tags/mtgmom) this week, though the overall win rate will probably still be my worst set on Arena so far.

- **Reading**: Finished reading [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow by Gabrielle Zevin](/2023/05/tomorrow3/)! I have not yet selected a new book to read next. Feed reader backlog: 117 items.

- **Watching**: Still watching *The Blacklist* S10, am about halfway through the season. Finished watching some stuff (pushing off reviews to next week), still so much other stuff I want to watch.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 70,821 steps and burned 24,641 calories.

    > "You can't learn the whole stack. Nobody can. Maybe it was possible in 1990, the day after the web was invented, but I'm not even sure about that. The stack grows and shifts and evolves every day. We are constantly throwing more money and more processor cycles away by using standards, packages and abstractions, and that's fine too."

Nobody owned the web, and the web wasn’t licensed. It was simply a part of the world, for anybody to use, distribute, or modify."

### This coming week (and beyond)

Next weekend there is another *March of the Machine* Arena Open which I am inclined to join despite my terrible record for the format so far.

Also, there is an open beta for *Street Fighter 6* next weekend! 

Trivia team also plans to attend another quiz night this week.
