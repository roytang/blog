title: 2023 Week 21
---

These weeknotes are coming in very late, because I was quite busy Saturday through Monday. June is coming up this year, and June coming around always makes me feel like the year is passing by so quickly since that's almost the halfway point. All the years pass by so quickly these days.

A supertyphoon was supposed to hit the country over the weekend, but the weather so far over the past few days has been quite pleasant (aside from some *habagat* rainshowers here and there). I think it's more of the northern side of the country being affected, but I read somewhere that NCR might start to feel the typhoon in the middle of the week maybe?

### My Week

- The week kind of went by in a blur, I suspect because of Zelda. Not much in terms of errands. A bit of productive side project work here and there.
- Spent the weekend out of town for a family gathering. It was fun, but exhausting. We were a bit worried about the prophesied supertyphoon screwing things up but *waves around at all the pleasant weather*.
- Trivia team didn't attend any quiz nights this week, but someone's been uploading some of our nonsense Discord sessions to [the Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph), you can check them out if you like people being stupid while trying to solve puzzles.
- [The Twitter API keys I use for this site's interop have stopped working over the past week](/2023/05/110420318576923027/), so I've disabled all Twitter integrations already. Might be worth a blog post later? IDK.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing so much *Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom*. The Switch says I have played it for "70 hours or more", which I just assume means 80 hours. I am a fair bit away from actually finishing the game (there is so much to do!), but I am assuming that when June hits I am going to start tempering my daily play time so I can get back some free time and do some of the other things I want to be doing.
    - Online: **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap** daily grinding continue as usual. **Eternal** is a bit neglected, but I try to sneak it in every so often.

- **Reading**: I still have not yet selected a new book to read next. Reading a lot of comics still; I wrote [a blog post about Jason Aaron's Thor/Avengers runs](/2023/05/comics-aaron-thor-avengers-realms/). Feed reader backlog: 97 items.

- **Watching**: Managed to watch a couple of movies this week: [The Raid (2011)](/2023/05/the-raid-2011/) and [Mystic River (2003)](/2023/05/mystic-river-2003/). Still trying to power through the final season of *The Flash*

### Walking

This past week (Sunday thru Saturday), Fitbit says I walked a total of 72,490 steps and burned 24,889 calories. I purposely tried to get a bit more steps in at the end of the week because I knew I'd be busy on the weekend and was worried that I would not meet the targets next week!

### Some Links of Interest

- [Linear feeds are a dark pattern](https://tilde.town/~dzwdz/blog/feeds.html): "Dark pattern" might be a bit too strong here. I think sometimes you do want a linear feed, but sometimes you might want something like what the OP describes. I think one issue is that anything more complicated than a linear feed might turn off most people who aren't terminally online, which is why most socmed platforms just default to a linear feed. The grouping OP describes is a common feature of RSS feed readers! Though they typically don't have the "per day" grouping thing, that sounds like an option feed readers could implement.

- [See your identity pieced together from stolen data - ABC News](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-05-18/data-breaches-your-identity-interactive/102175688): Nice visualization of the breaches you were involved in. I was in 18 breaches!
