title: Saving Time by Jenny Odell
---

I think I heard about this book because it was mentioned in a blog I follow, but I am no longer able to find the relevant post. This book reminded me of my only other non-fiction read so far this year, [Four Thousand Weeks](/2023/03/four-thousand-weeks/), especially in the sense that I initially thought it would be about time management but it turns out to be more of a philosophical discussion of what time even means and different ways to think about time especially outside of the dominant capitalist productivity context.

The book was a good read but a bit challenging as it's quite information dense so it took me a while to get through. At least the book wasn't as long as I thought it would be, the second half was mostly just notes and bibliography which I didn't bother with.

### Quotes

#### Introduction: A Message for the Meantime

> “Leisure does not exist for the sake of work,” Pieper wrote, “however much strength it may give a man to work; the point of leisure is not to be a restorative, a pick-me-up, whether mental or physical; and though it give new strength, mentally and physically, and spiritually too, that is not the point.”

#### Chapter 1: Whose Time, Whose Money?

> Plantation owners were some of the earliest users of what we would now call spreadsheets, producing preprinted work logs and conducting labor-timing experiments similar to the ones Taylor would become famous for many decades later.
>

...

> In other words, the goal of capitalism is not free time but economic growth; any time freed up goes right back into the machine to increase profits. Thus the paradox: The factory is efficient, but it also produces “the drive toward the consumption of the person’s time up to its outermost, physical limit.” Or, as the workplace adage would have it, “The only reward for working faster is more work.”
>

#### Chapter 2: Self Timer

> Time management illuminates the assumptions of the will-versus-circumstance debate because it takes the individual as the absolute unit and the near future as the time frame, at the expense of the collective good. Even Sharma understands time management’s appeal, which also happens to be its danger. “It is an intoxicating concern: how to have a better relationship to time control and technology,” she writes. “But this cultural fixation on time control and one’s ability to modulate time, to manage it better, slow it down and speed it up, is antithetical to the collective sense of time necessary for a political understanding of time.” It’s precisely this political understanding of time that would allow one to look outward, imagining different “structural arrangements of power.” This can’t be done alone, and it usually can’t be done in the short term. In the lengthy meantime, I’m reminded of a saying that a Spanish journalist shared with me, regarding the phenomenon of burnout: “Do you need a therapist, or do you need a union?”

...

> If time management is not simply an issue of numerical hours but of some people having more control over their time than others, then the most realistic and expansive version of time management has to be collective: It has to entail a different distribution of power and security. In the realm of policy, that would mean things that seem obviously related to time—for example, subsidized childcare, paid leave, better overtime laws, and “fair workweek laws,” which seek to make part-time employees’ schedules more predictable and to compensate them when they are not. Less obviously related to time—but absolutely relevant to it—are campaigns for a higher minimum wage, a federal jobs guarantee, or universal basic income.[*5]

...

> We are taught from the beginning that faithfully squeezing the most value out of your twenty-four hours, “steady as time,” is what a good person does; constantly expanding, pursuing opportunities, and getting ahead in every arena of experience is what a good life means. But if work inhabits the social unconscious, it is work according to a historically specific ideal: fast, muscular, unflagging, and white. Recognizing how deeply certain concepts of speed, efficiency, and progress are woven into our culture is yet another way of understanding Brittney Cooper’s argument that “white people own time.”
>

> In the meantime, it is worth decoding the advice to “live your best life” as what it sometimes is: an imperative to “live the best life,” in the sense of a high score. What about choosing to just “live a life”? Sometimes when I find myself grasping too much, I simply repeat to myself, almost in the tone of a parent toward a child, that everything can’t be everything.

#### Chapter 3: Can There Be Leisure?

> Papers in the Journal of Travel Research have detailed the many uses of “social media envy” and “incidental vicarious travel consumption (IVTC),” noting that people with low self-esteem are especially susceptible and should be of special interest to marketers.
>

...

> I can’t think of a better description of commercial social media, where the “stuff” is a sense of belonging. I have no problem with the idea of an online social network; I just don’t want to buy a sense of community with my attention to ads, on a platform that implicitly encourages me to advertise myself, all while my data gets collected.
>

...

> If leisure has been an apolitical sanctuary for the people who are favored by such norms, it has always been political for those who are disfavored and for whom access to an enjoyable, dignified life is inescapably an issue of justice.
>

...

> And, you know, just realizing that my existence is not just bound to my job, social media, and whatever in between—these things that happen—it’s like, Oh, wow, I’m a living human in this moment in time. And wow, even with all the bullshit, I’m actually deeply grateful to be alive.
>

#### Chapter 4: Putting Time Back in Its Place

> “This is no longer even conditioning, it’s anaesthesia,” Perec writes. “We sleep through our lives in a dreamless sleep. But where is our life? Where is our body? Where is our space?”
>

#### Chapter 5: A Change of Subject

> Just as the industry of individual time management resells the idea of time as money to the isolated bootstrapper, energy companies sell the idea of the carbon footprint to conceal larger and more significant avenues of change.
>

...

> Amelioration was technical, a question of how to use objects better; abolition was moral, a question of who was a subject. Energy companies cannot imagine a future without the objects of extraction and, therefore, must promote and fund a worldview in which earth remains an object. Plantation owners could not imagine futures without the objects of slavery and, therefore, promoted and funded a worldview in which enslaved people remained objects.
>

...

> The world is ending—but which world? Consider that many worlds have ended, just as many worlds have been born and are about to be born. Consider that there is nothing a priori about any of them. Just as a thought experiment, imagine that you were not born at the end of time, but actually at the exact right time, that you might grow up to be, as the poet Chen Chen writes, “a season from the planet / of planet-sized storms.” Hallucinate a scenario, hallucinate yourself in it. Then tell me what you see.
>

...

> But if, just for a moment, we leave behind historically and culturally specific notions of clock-based punctuality and time as money, then Filipino time actually doesn’t appear to be a problem at all. If you and everyone you know are on it, then it’s just time.
> 

#### Chapter 7: Life Extension

> Maybe “the point” isn’t to live more, in the literal sense of a longer or more productive life, but rather, to be more alive in any given moment—a movement outward and across, rather than shooting forward on a narrow, lonely track. 
>
