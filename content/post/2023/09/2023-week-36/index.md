### The World

Eh, what? There's a world outside?

### My Week

As mentioned last week, I spent most of this week in the hospital to take care of a loved one who was to undergo surgery.

Happily, we were discharged yesterday, a few days less than the estimated stay.

I am not inclined to write in detail about the hospital stay. Maybe some short notes:

- The patient had meals included with the room, but I had to subsist mostly on microwave-able 7-11 meals and a nearby stall of *Kambal Pandesal*
- I still have trouble staying in an airconditioned room all day; my skin starts to get flaky. Though it was much worse during our 2021 covid stay.
- The operation itself took the better part of a day. I am told it ran for 9 hours, then the patient had to stay in the recovery room for like 4 more hours before they could be returned to our room. As you can imagine, I was anxious throughout most of it. I ate many snacks that day.
- The surgery team was very good (and expensive). The patient did well and recovered easily, hence the early discharge. We were actually cleared for discharge a day earlier, but the patient wanted to stay an extra day just in case.
- It is quite expensive to get sick and have such operations in this country. It's not as expensive as the US, but then again we also don't earn as much money here. Our family is lucky that we can afford these things (just barely), poorer families would have had much more difficult times.

The first thing I did when we got back home (after some rest) was actually to write a blog post, which tells you a lot about how much I enjoy blogging. Unfortunately, I still have a backlog of reviews to write, so some of the things mentioned in the media diet section below will not have links yet, but they will magically be edited in once I have written them.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - Minimal game time for **Baldur's Gate 3** and **Sea of Stars** this week. My laptop cannot handle BG3, and it's not Windows so PC Game Pass would not have worked for Sea of Stars.
        - Instead, my brother lent me **Xenoblade Chronicles 3** on Switch and I started playing that, which may or may not be a mistake, because now I'm home and have 3 ongoing RPGs to think about! (I was actually lent all 3 XC games but decided to just skip 1 and 2 to play the third one.) I only managed to play about 5-6 hours of the game during the stay, but that was enough to get me to Act 3 which means technically I am ahead of my Baldur's Gate playthrough currently still in Act 2?
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: I missed the **Wilds of Eldraine** release date on Arena of course, but I did manage to do a sealed last night after we got home. It went quite well!
        - **Marvel Snap** was the only other game I played during the hospital stay. I ended last season on Infinite, but am struggling to get past 85 or so this season, as this current Loki meta is a bit challenging for me.
        - **Eternal** I installed this on mobile, but never got around to it.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is at a reasonable 27 items. Managed to finish a book while at the hospital, [Saving Time by Jenny Odell](/2023/09/saving-time/). Also started a new book, **The Name of the Rose** by Umberto Eco, but have not gotten too far into it yet, the prose is very challenging. Since access to Marvel Unlimited was problematic, I read some other comics instead. Some DC since I've been neglecting their series recently (mostly the current excellent run of *World's Finest*) and also the graphic novel ["It's Lonely at the Center of the Earth" by Zoe Thorogood](/2023/09/its-lonely/).

- **Watching**: I actually managed to watch a decent amount of Netflix and Disney+ via my phone. A bit too much perhaps, as I burned through my data cap halfway through and had to add to my phone bill a bit for extra data. I watched [season 1 of One Piece](/2023/09/one-piece/) and also finished watching [Star Wars Rebels](/2023/09/star-wars-rebels/) since I wanted to watch that before starting **Ahsoka**, which I managed to watch the first episode of.

### Walking

Unsurprisingly last week's total step count was a ridiculously low 14,913 steps since I was stuck in the hospital room for most of the stay. I was actually told that as the watcher I was free to roam the hospital grounds (since that lets me buy my food!), but I didn't want to leave the patient for extended periods unless necessary, so it's good that I managed more than 10k steps for the week as it is. 

Hopefully I manage to get back into the flow of it this coming week!

### Things I've been thinking about

Medical costs, anxiety, diets, universal *affordable* healthcare, poverty, nursing, bad posture, sketching, time, chance, memory, etc etc

### Things I'm looking forward to

Uh, I'm not sure! Mostly hoping to just settle back into my regular routines. I have so many things to catch up on!

Starfield came out last week, but maybe I should clear one of my 3 ongoing RPGs before getting started on that.

Will probably try to stream some Wilds of Eldraine drafts sometime this week.

New season of Lower Decks also came out last week, but the new season isn't available yet on Prime Video where I've been watching the series. Not sure if Paramount is still going to release them there or what.
