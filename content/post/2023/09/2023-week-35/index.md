It is September. Publishing this one a bit early because events are accumulating rapidly and I will be busy Sunday (and for the foreseeable future), more on that below.

### The World

In local news, there was [a fire last Thursday early in the morning](https://mb.com.ph/2023/8/31/15-dead-as-fires-hits-building-in-qc). This was very near our house, a couple of roads down, maybe 150-200 meters away? My dad woke up to see the flames outside his window. Luckily it was raining heavily at the time so the fire didn't get a chance to spread. It's made the news cycle for a couple of days as apparently it was operating illegally (without permits) as a t-shirt printing shop of some kind, and most of those who died were workers from the provinces.

### My Week

It was a bit of hectic week in terms of family medical errands, tests and consultations and such. It all came to a head last Friday when we found out a family member would be scheduled for a major surgery this coming week. I will be staying with them at the hospital as support/watcher, so I will be out of the house for at least a week starting Sunday. Aside from worrying about the procedure, this is highly disruptive and short notice. Hospital accomodations aren't exactly the best, and after our extended hospital stay in 2021 due to Covid I am probably more adverse to the idea than I should be. Hopefully we don't have to stay too long and we won't be as restricted since it's not a Covid ward.

Even worse, I am told that the hospital rooms don't offer any wifi, so I will be reliant on good old mobile data, such as it is. I am likely to be breaking most of my regular routines for the next couple of weeks. I'll also be missing a quiz night, some regular gaming sessions, etc.

On the blog: I wrote about [fast food consumption](/2023/08/fast-food-consumption/) and [zero interest rate phenomenons](/2023/08/zero-interest-rate-phenomenon/). I probably won't be able to blog too much while at the hospital, as I tend to do that at my desk, but we shall see.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: 
        - **Baldur's Gate 3**: finally broke through to Act 2, but will be a while before I can play again.
        - Also started playing **Sea of Stars** via PC game pass. It's a very pretty game, but I am not too far in and again, it will be a while before I can get back to it.
        - Wrote the review for [Middle-Earth: Shadow of War](/2023/08/shadow-of-war/).
        - **Middle-Earth: Shadow of War**: I finally hit 100% completion on this game! Will write the review post this week then I can move on.
        - Seeing if I can borrow some Switch RPG to play while I'm staying over at the hospital.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: I was looking forward to drafting **Wilds of Eldraine** when it comes out this coming week, but it looks like I'm gonna miss out on that and a week or so of grinding at least. Too bad the game isn't actually available on mobile in SEA!
        - **Marvel Snap** daily grinds continue, still trying to get to infinite before the season is up. At least I can (probably) play this while at the hospital.
        - **Eternal** being played roughly once a week. Actually, this one is available on mobile, maybe I'll look into that.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is starting to rise at 29 items. Still very early in the Daredevil run, but reading Marvel Unlimited via mobile data probably isn't feasible while at the hospital. I have preloaded some other books and comics I might want to read offline during the stay. (We shall see if I ever get around to them.)

- **Watching**: No movies this week, but I have finished season 3 of **Star Wars Rebels**. Not sure if I can watch stuff while at the hospital.

### Walking

Google Fit tells me I walked 65,010 over the past week. I hit my walking target for most of the week, but Saturday was very rainy and busy with last-minute preps so I decided not to push it. Gonna be missing out on walking while I'm at the hospital anyway, hopefully I can get back to it quickly once we're out. 

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot this week. I typically go through my links backlog when I'm at my desk, so there probably won't be a lot next week either.

- [Energy makes time | everything changes](https://everythingchanges.us/blog/energy-makes-time/): 

    > "They had assumed, wrongly, that there wasn’t enough time in the day to do their art, because they assumed ... that every thing we do costs time. But that math doesn’t take energy into account, doesn’t grok that doing things that energize you gives you time back. By doing their art, a whole lot of time suddenly returned. Their art didn’t need more time; their time needed their art."

### Things I've been thinking about

Hope, anxiety, worry, rain, fire, gaining weight, teaching older people about tech, filling one's time, winning the lottery, heroes, to-do-lists, etc.

### Things I'm looking forward to

- Hoping the procedure goes well and we can go home earlier than expected.
- Actually still hoping for a good week!
