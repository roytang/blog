*It's Lonely at the Centre of the Earth* is an "auto-bio-graphic-novel" by up-and-coming UK graphic artist Zoe Thorogood, published by Image Comics.

I forget where I heard about this book, but it is so unbelievably good. I finished it in more or less one sitting and came away mostly envious at the author's talent both in art and storytelling and wishing I could put together something like this. 

Trigger warning: the book tackles topics like depression, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, and other mental health-related concerns.

Oh, to be young and talented, yet at the same time plagued by mental health issues. I don't consider myself to be afflicted by depression (more like the garden-variety anxiety experienced by adults in our modern dystopia), but I find many of her stories to be very relatable and they are presented so vividly and wildly and imaginatively. She constantly shifts between a wacky, cartoony style to a more realistic, serious and grim approach and everything in between. This is an excellent graphic novel that could only have been expressed in this medium.

I thought about including more panel excerpts from the book aside from the cover, but honestly it's probably best experienced as a whole.

Zoe Thorogood is [Eisner-award nominated](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/16/the-real-deal-young-graphic-artist-zoe-thorogood-nominated-for-five-eisners) and has been called "the future of comics", and that is very easy to believe. I look forward to reading more of her work.
