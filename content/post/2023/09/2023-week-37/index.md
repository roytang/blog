title: 2023 Week 37

### The World

[Unity saw how Musk pissed off Twitter's users and they were like "hold my beer".](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/12/23870547/unit-price-change-game-development).

Whenever I watch the local news, it feels like it's 80% about price increases and 10% about abusive cops. (And also 10% showbiz, which is a bit silly, but I don't really have a problem with.)

### My Week

This week was quite busy. Felt very productive actually. A lot of medical errands still (follow-up tests and checkups after last week's procedure), bank errands I should have gotten to a few weeks/months ago, some hardware purchases/replacements I'd been putting off, some changes to this site, a bunch of personal archival work, family visits, etc. This entry is coming in a bit late because today was quite busy as well.

On the blog: I wrote about [moving on from Fitbit](/2023/09/moving-on-fitbit/), [how we used to watch movies](/2023/09/watch-movies/), [note-taking](/2023/09/note-taking/), and caught up with some pending reviews.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: It's still a bit insane that I am playing (or trying to play) 3 different RPGs (with different play styles!) concurrently. **Baldur's Gate 3**, **Xenoblade Chronicles 3** and **Sea of Stars** are all in progress, albeit very slowly because I'm splitting my time between them. Hopefully I can clear at least one of these before the new Mario game comes out in October!
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Did a lot of **Wilds of Eldraine** drafting this week and even streamed a bunch over on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/twitchyroy). You can follow along using [the MTGWOE tag](/tags/mtgwoe). I also played the Arena Open this weekend, but [didn't do well](/2023/09/111079568713413791/) =/
        - **Marvel Snap** regular grinding still going on. **Eternal** has a new set coming out soonish I think, but I still don't play it very often these days.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is at an unwieldy 41 items. Not a lot of reading this week, mostly just comics.

- **Watching**: Caught up with **Ahsoka** and also the current season of **Futurama**, might look for something else to binge. Also apparently **Iron Fist** had a season 2 and I was completely unaware?!?

### Walking

We are back to form with 70,961 steps total last week (Sunday through Saturday), according to Google Fit.

### Some Links of Interest

- [What Newton really meant | Daniel Hoek » IAI TV](https://iai.tv/articles/what-newton-really-meant-daniel-hoek-auid-2579): This is interesting, but it also mostly just reminded me of [the Newton spiel from Mass Efffect 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPRIUJzmkC0)

- [Willingham Sends Fables Into the Public Domain](https://billwillingham.substack.com/p/willingham-sends-fables-into-the): What a move, no notes. Other than to check out Fables if you haven't, it's pretty good.

- [100 things I know - by Mari Andrew - Out of the Blue](https://mariandrew.substack.com/p/100-things-i-know): 

- [Rediscovering the Old Internet Vibe — Noisy Deadlines](https://noisydeadlines.net/rediscovering-the-old-internet-vibe): 

- [Does anyone think Twitter gets *better* from here?](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/does-anyone-think-twitter-gets-better): 

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### Site Changes

- various fixes to the backend importing jobs
- [I found out that markdown has it's own footnotes syntax](/2023/09/111046857453396502/) and updatedolder posts and the backend to use that so I can discard my own implementation
- also, this isn't deployed yet, but I'm generally unhappy with how photos/videos are rendered in various pages and listings so I'm trying to find a good approach and playing around with some options. Might take a while though
- adding this site changes section to the weeknotes because I saw someone else doing it in their weeknotes lol

### Things I've been thinking about

Errands, finances, investments, variance, sadness, moving on, the past, getting things done, multitasking.

### Things I'm looking forward to

Nothing specific this coming week, but hopefully I can get more stuff done and blog more!
