I stopped playing [Wordle](/tags/wordle/) [early last year](/2022/04/final-wordles/) but since then I have still regularly encountered a type of online game I call "daily web games" characterized similarly to Wordle in that they are (a) web-based and (b) come out with a new game/puzzle/challenge every day. Here are some of the ones I've encountered.

#### [Connections (New York Times)](https://www.nytimes.com/games/connections)

Although this one is an NYT game, a subscription is NOT required so everyone can play. It's a simple word association/grouping game where you need to arrange a set of 16 terms into 4 connected groups. You migt have seen similar puzzles elsewhere, it's not an original concept. Having a new one every day is pretty nice. This is fairly new, about 3 and a half months in I believe.

This one has been a hit with the trivia team. We tried it first during one of our regular Discord sessions, but we quickly transitioned to everyone just doing it solo. We have a Discord thread for it and shortly after midnight, people start posting their results for the latest Connections.

**Related**: Someone made a [custom Connections puzzle creator](https://connections.swellgarfo.com/). Conveniently, this site also has an archive for all the official ones (convenient since the NYT doesn't provide it).

#### [Cine2Nerdle](https://www.cinenerdle2.app/)

*(This one is mildly confusing because the title has the "2" in the middle but the URL has it at the end!)*

This one is mainly for movie buffs. They currently offer three types of puzzles:

- Original: You are given a 4x4 grid of terms (usually actor names or movie plot elements) and have to arrange them such that some number of rows and columns (usually 5) are each associated with a specific movie. The movies involved are only revealed once you have completed their row/column.
- Reversal: Haven't tried this one yet, but the concept is you are given a 4x4 grid of movies and have to arrange them accordng to specific concepts/themes, basically a reversal of "Original"
- Logical: These are weekly puzzles instead of daily and they are super-challenging. You are given a 4x4 grid of movie-related terms AND a set of rules and have to find a way to arrange the grid such that they satisfy all the rules. The rules might be something like "all film in this row must be in release order" or "Leonardo diCaprio must be adjacent to all his costars" or "All actors who have appeared in Christopher Nolan films are on the same row". Basically a wide range of movie knowledge is required. 

I don't play this one daily, but the archives are always available, so every so often I binge through a bunch of the Original ones; they are fairly quick to do and it's easy to go down a rabbit hole and do a lot of them in one go. The Logical ones we only found about recently and the trivia team has been trying to solve them together.

#### Others

These are mostly ones that I found but haven't been playing regularly. (This post is once again an excuse to dump a bunch of links I had saved up!)

- [framed.wtf](https://framed.wtf/): Guess the movie based on the screenshots/stills. These are super challenging and probably the reason I never stuck with it.
- [Diffle](https://hedalu244.github.io/diffle/): This is a word-guessing game like Wordle, but a bit more complicated and there is no set word size.
- [NYT Flashback](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/09/22/upshot/flashback.html): This is a weekly history quiz similar to above where you have to arrange the events in chronological order. Kind of like the [Wiki History game](https://wikitrivia.tomjwatson.com/) the trivia team likes. Fairly challenging because I am bad at history, but not great because (a) requires an NYT account (I think a free one works); and (b) there doesn't seem to be a set URL for a hub for the puzzles, each week has a different URL (the linked one is for this week's puzzle).
- [New Word Order](https://www.monkeon.co.uk/new-word-order/): Another "rearrange in chronological order" game, this time for when new words/phrases came into use. Can be even more challenging than sorting historical events. This one is NOT a daily, seems you can play as many times as you like.
- [Globle](https://globle-game.com/): A country-guessing game. You name a country and you are told how close (geographically) you are to the actual country. Geography is another subject I am poor at.
- [Squaredle](https://squaredle.app/): This is something like the old Boggle word-finding game. The wordlists include "bonus words" that are not required for completion and are slang or obscure/archaic or not part of American English
- [Identifive](https://identifive.com/): This is a very simple word-finding game where every day you have to find exactly one five-letter word in a grid. I didn't find it very exciting.
- Digits (defunct) / [Additional](https://additional.today/): NYT had a short-lived arithmetic game called "Digits" where you had a set of 6 numbers (usually between 1-25 I think), and had to combine them using arithmetic to hit a target number. Each day had five rounds with increasing difficulty. I believe Digits ended last August, but Additional is heavily based on it and is basically the same thing.

I suspect I have more similar links saved somewhere, but these are the ones I have for now.

#### Like and Subscribe

The trivia team gets together via Discord a few times a week to collectively do the NYT crossword and spelling bee and sometimes/often some puzzle games like the above. We have [a Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph/videos) where we share videos of our shenanigans if you like that sort of thing. Our discussions are often in mixed Tagalog/English though.

#### Acrostics

The NYT website used to feature twice-a-month Acrostic puzzles. The [trivia team loved these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpcDcGDBMkU) and the archive went back as far as 1999! Unfortunately, earlier this year they decided to not only stop publishing new acrostics to the website, but even removed access to the archives completely! This meant we could not complete all the archives in time! Before that happened, I reverse-engineered and scraped all of the actual puzzles and archived them here on my own website: [NYT Acrostics Archive](https://roytang.net/files/acrostics/). The puzzles here use the same JS as the originals and are fully-playable online on the client-side; the only lost functionality is that progress is not saved in any way so if you reload the page you have to start over. We were able to use this to play them all even after the NYT took them down, today I release this to the public. (Note to NYT: Don't sue me! You took them down!)
