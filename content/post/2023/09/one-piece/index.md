As a One Piece fan, I had been looking forward to this, but the recent history of live action anime adaptations has been spotty at best so I kept my expectations low. I am happy to report that this is a reasonably good adaptation and although the plot is compressed to fit as many arcs as possible in 8 episodes, the tone and spirit of the source material is alive and well and is certainly better than other recent live-action anime adaptations. 

Changes to the plot were understandable, given how well certain shonen manga tropes like Sanji's pervishness or the extended boss battles would not have translated well to a live action series. Despite the plot modifications, most of the iconic plot points were still hit and I kind of want to re-read/re-watch the original to do comparisons. (Though I'm pretty sure someone on the internet has already done this by now.)

The costumes and special effects are reasonably good; I was worried that Luffy's rubber effect and the fishmen and other devil fruit stuff would come off real corny, but they actually pulled it off. A low point is probably the Kuro / Usopp / Kaya arc, as the Cat pirates look a bit like poorly-done cosplay and the pacing of that arc could have been done better.

The acting can be uneven or corny in some places, but most of the main cast performs reasonably well. Inaki's Luffy is a bit more serious and a bit more self-aware than the original, but that's reasonable for an adaptation. The rest of the crew range from ok to good reflections of their anime counterparts. I thought Arlong and his fishmen might end up ridiculous, but the actor kind of carried it with how menacing he was. A standout performance was that of Buggy; for the longest time I was like "this actor seems so familiar" and only later did it finally click that it was Jeff Ward/Zeke from Agents of SHIELD! His performance is great and I would not be surprised if he would eventually get cast as a live-action Joker just because of this role.

Overall happy with how the adaptation turned out and I am looking forward to see how far they can push season 2. After East Blue things are only going to get more ridiculous so I'm curious to see how they'll handle it. (What would Chopper even look like?!?) It's too bad that it's not likely to actually catch up to the ridiculously long anime / manga; at the current pace that would take something like 30 seasons at least, and given it's Netflix that's unlikely! That being said if they get even as far as completing the Alabasta arc I would be satisfied.
