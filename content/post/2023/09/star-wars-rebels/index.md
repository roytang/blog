The new Ahsoka series started a few weeks ago but I decided to binge-watch Rebels first since it looks like some of the characters will be coming back. It's a reasonably good show that significantly expands the Star Wars canon especially re: what happened in the fledgling days of the rebellion before *A New Hope*. I got into it a lot more easily than I did *Clone Wars*, which I have only seen one season of. (I find it hard to care about the clones.) There is a bit of weight of continuity problem here, since there are some references to plotlines from *Clone Wars*, specifically around the Mandalorians and Maul, but it's not too much.

The cast of characters is good and having four seasons gives us time to get to know them well. Ezra's journey mirrors Luke's in a lot of ways, complete with a final temptation from the emperor himself towards the end. Admiral Thrawn provides a chilling and cunning villain for the second half of the series. We do know ahead of time it's likely that Kanan and Ezra and Thrawn won't be around by the end of the series (since they are never mentioned in the rebellion in the OG trilogy), but many OG trilogy charactes make appearances here as well.

Looking forward to Ahsoka's series!
