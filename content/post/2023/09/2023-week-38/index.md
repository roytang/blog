### The World

Lol, [Unity has walked back some of the stuff that pissed off its userbase](https://www.pcgamer.com/unity-install-fee-changes/). That was quick, though the damage may already have been done, trust-wise.

The past couple of days have been very smoggy/hazy here in the Metro. There were reports of [vog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vog) (apparently that is a real term) coming out of nearby Taal volcano a couple of days ago, but apparently that's unrelated. The Metro haze was cause mostly by good old pollution compounded by a thermal inversion.

### My Week

This week was much lazier, especially as compared to the week prior. Still some errands and some side project work and some other stuff, but much more relaxed and chill and I got a lot more sleep somehow.

The youngest *pamangkin* (less than a year old) had to be left in my care for about an hour and a half the other day. She was asleep for most of that, but for the 30 minutes she was awake, I must admit I did a bang-up job keeping her occupied and not wondering where her parents were.

On the blog: Not as much this week (see above), but I did manage to write about [daily web games and similar things](/2023/09/daily-puzzle-games/).

### Some Recent Purchases

{{% photos 20230924_164222 %}}

My old Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2016 was having some keys start to fail and I didn't feel like spending too much on a new one, so I bought a cheap Red Dragon K2 keyboard. It works, but I must say I am not too happy with how it "feels", if that makes sense; I liked my old keyboard much better.

I also bought a new controller, an 8Bitdo Ultimate Bluetooth controller. It works on both Windows and Switch and was super easy to use; was happy with this purchase. Honestly my [old F710 Logitech controller](/2014/06/10153045324368912-0/) was mostly still working fine, except that I often had to re-initialize the wireless connection if I hadn't used it for a few days. The new one avoids that problem, so yay. My main motivation for getting this new one was as a Switch controller, because (a) I could feel some of the joycon shoulder buttons start to become less responsive; and (b) I am hoping I can play multiplayer *Super Mario Wonder* with the *pamangkins* when that comes out, and for that we needmore controllers.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Managed to get **Baldur's Gate 3** past Act 2, so yay progress? **Xenoblade Chronicles 3** and **Sea of Stars** are both still inching forward as well.
    - Online: 
        - **Magic Arena**: Only did two [Wilds of Eldraine](/tags/mtgwoe) drafts this week, slowing down a bit.
        - **Marvel Snap** regular grinding still going on. 
        - **Eternal** still only roughly once a week.

- **Reading**: Feed reader backlog is at an unwieldy 37 items. Not a lot of reading this week, mostly just comics, though I have managed to clear the first 100 issues of Daredevil somehow. 

- **Watching**: I have watched [The Italian Job (2003)](/2023/09/the-italian-job-2003/), but not much else.

### Walking

Managed 70,691 steps this past week (Sunday through Saturday), according to Google Fit. It was a bit of a challenging and rainy week and the smog over the weekend made it so a mask was needed even when outdoors.

### Some Links of Interest

- [I'm a Spotless Giraffe. | Ben Myers](https://benmyers.dev/blog/spotless-giraffe/): 

    > "It is something of an amusing curiosity that some AI models were perplexed by a giraffe without spots. But it's these same tools and paradigms that enshrine normativity of all kinds, "sanding away the unusual." As tech continues to charge headfirst into AI hype, this is going to have far-reaching, yet largely invisible to the mainstream, consequences to anyone on the wrong side of that normativity. Better hope you have spots."

    Those details remind me how screwed up the whole copyright system currently is.

### Site Changes

- minor fixes to how images are rendered on the site. Previously the aspect ratio on thumbnails was wrong if the display resolution was too low. Image galleries now support `masonry` layout in Firefox if you have enabled that toggle (I might write about this in the future, it's neat).

### Things I've been thinking about

Entropy and things falling apart, wanting things but being too lazy to put in the effort, the past being a foreign country, so many games upcoming that I want to play, not enough time/energy for all the things I want to do, where can I get a [hyperbolic time chamber](https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperbolic_Time_Chamber), future finance problems, etc.

### Things I'm looking forward to

There is a Ludum Dare scheduled for next weekend, but I don't know if I'm going to participate. It's not that I don't have time, but rather I don't really have the gamedev energy at the moment. I skipped the last LD and I haven't even touched Godot in months. I want to do more gamedev, but it's one of those things where I have to consider my approach and how to motivate myself to move forward - I'm not sure game jams are the way anymore.
