The studio put out a promotional blitz before it's release stating that no one would be allowed entrance to the theater after the start of the film.

I wasn't alive when Pyscho came out, but I'm pretty sure that practice of just coming in at any point in the film was still pervasive here throughout the 80s and 90s.

I remember when we were kids my dad would take the entire family out to the movies and because we didn't observe set times, we would arrive in the middle of it and by then the movie would be mostly standing room only. Or at least, it looked like that. When we got in my mom and my brothers and me would wait in the back or in the sides filled with standing moviegoers while my dad went up and down the aisles looking for free seats. He often succeeded, since people liked to sit together and that left the odd seat or two available. Our family had no such restrictions so when my dad found a free seat, he would wave one of us over to sit there and we would all end up watching separately until the next showing rolled over and we would get to the point where we came in. At that point my dad would come over one by one to our seats to pick us up so we could go.

My dad would also tell us stories of sometimes how he'd go to movie theaters just to nap in the air-conditioning. Even if he missed part of the movie, he could just roll over to the next showing to see what had happened.

I don't think enforcement of set movie times caught on here until after I started working in the early 2000s, when reserved seating started to become the norm.
