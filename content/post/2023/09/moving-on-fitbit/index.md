title: Moving on from Fitbit
---

I first got a Fitbit Charge 2 back in mid-2017 and [wrote a short review of it in 2018](/2018/11/fitbit/). Since then I have been generally happy using the device with little concern, except for occasionally [having to buy replacement straps](/2021/05/1396076491021058050/) which I didn't mind too much as they weren't very expensive. 

Early this year, my tracker started to have problems with the display and after a few weeks it would not display anything at all. I figured that wasn't too bad, it lasted for almost 5 years without any real issues. Still, I was able to keep using it for a few months after that, I simply couldn't view my step count on my wrist and would have to look at the app on my phone for that. This was still manageable for me.

Two or three months ago, I made a mistake that rendered the Fitbit entirely unusable. I had found that for some reason it had recently had trouble syncing with the app on my phone and my brilliant idea to fix that was to remove the Fitbit from the app and re-pair it to the phone so that. Only after removing the Fitbit from the app did I realize that oops, apparently doing that meant the Fitbit was no longer recognized by my account and it would need a sync-ing code to be re-paired. A code which would need to be read off my Fitbit's display. The display which was no longer working. Oops.

This was 100% on me, and I kind of panicked a bit and realized I'd have to buy a new tracker. It's too bad because I would have been fine with just using the old one indefinitely, despite the broken display.

I checked around on Lazada and found that the latest Fitbit Charge models were a bit too pricey for my comfort zone (TBF, the Charge 2 was also too pricey for me and the only reason I got the first one was that my brother got a good deal off some credit card promo). However, I chanced upon a seller selling Fitbit Charge 2s for relatively cheap, roughly a third of what the latest Charge models were going for. Wow, what a deal! I figured getting another Charge 2 was a good idea since I was already used to the device and I wasn't really interested in any new features.

My friends, it was not a good idea. In hindsight, I should have known better than buying an older model (no longer being manufactured) for cheap from an unknown online seller that doesn't even have a physical presence in this country (as I would find out later).

The first problem was that a mere two days after the new Fitbit was delivered, the straps broke off. Both sides! WTH! I messaged the seller angrily and after some waffling they agreed to ship me a new strap but it would take a few weeks because apparently they are in China! I would see little notifs in their chat that translation was provided by Alibaba or such. The listing was marked as "Metro Manila" so this was a surprise to me.

This was [the listing in question](https://www.lazada.com.ph/products/i3661511108-s19162366634.html). The listing says there is "Local Supplier Warranty" for up to 2 years, so I was like even if there's a problem, I can have it replaced right? The image even says "Official Fitbit store!" I was so naive.

Anyway, I still had some extra straps, so even after the provided straps broke, I was able to use the new Fitbit for a couple of weeks. Except for some reason it was unable to update the firmware? I didn't really mind at that time - there was just an notification that wouldn't go away. But then sometime in the second week I found that the battery of the Fitbit suddenly started draining rapidly. As in from a full charge it would be dead within a minute of removing it from the charger. This was so bad!

[This Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKeVfJQEZbg) illustrates the problem.

After some digging around Fitbit support forums and other research, I found out that this was [an issue with the Fitbit Charge 2 and a particular firmware update from a few years ago](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/fitbit-charge-2-firmware-update-battery-1.5258511). An issue that was never addressed apparently!

I once again complained to the seller. They said I needed to take it to a brick and mortar store for replacement. There are no Fitbit brick and mortar stores in my country. I asked if the unit was used or refurbished. "Original," they claimed. They said I needed to contact Fitbit support. So I did. 

Fitbit's website has a live chat where I raised the issue to an agent and they said they'd get back to me after considering the case. After a few days, I got an email saying that the unit could not be covered by their warranty, which supposedly covers a free replacement within a year of the initial purchase. I had a follow-up live chat to confirm WHY the unit could not be covered by the warranty. This was the reply I got (verbatim):

> After checking deeper on my tools I found that your device is no longer under warranty, since it was paired to the account on 2017/01/01, our warranty only covers 1 year, and this was already fulfilled on 2018/01/01, I can also see that your device was purchased from an unauthorized retailer, for these reasons our warranty does not cover your device either.
> 

Aha! I say this to the Lazada seller since it means they were lying to me and I demand they refund me, but the customer support just keeps saying it is an original device and refuses to acknowledge the problem.

I go back and forth with them for a few days, but I know I am out of options here. The order was already past Lazada's 7-day return period when the battery issue happened; I really should have filed the return after the straps broke and I spoke to their support for the first time, since at that point I already saw them as suspicious and I was already having second thoughts, but my ire was mollified by the promise of replacement straps. 

I finally gave up conversing with the customer support and just promised/threatened a scathing review and also reporting on both their listing and their store (which I am not optimistic will lead anywhere).

This was the review I left (1/5 stars):

> Very bad.
> 
> After 2 days the strap of the Fitbit broke off. I had to convince them to send me a replacement strap and it took 2 weeks to get to me.
> 
> After 2 weeks, the Fitbit stopped holding a charge! The listing says there is a warranty and the seller told me I need to speak to Fitbit directly (already bad) but Fitbit said the unit is not covered by warranty because it was already activated in 2016 and that I had purchased from an unauthorized reseller. I asked for a refund, but the seller just kept repeating "original" at me.
> 
> Goes to show it was too good to be true that such an old model would still have warranty!
> 
> Very bad support. Seller is basically a scammer.

I have accepted this was a loss and am ready to move on. And I need to remember never to rely on unknown Lazada sellers for things that I want a warranty on.

(I had later spoken to someone at a *Digital Walker* store and they confirmed they automatically replace problematic Fitbit units within a year of purchase; but of course they would only have had the more expensive newer models in stock.)

At this point I am done with Fitbit and have shifted to using the Google Fit app for my daily step tracking. I tried Google Fit some years ago, before I had a Fitbit and at the time was mildly annoyed with the variance in the step counting, but my recent tests with the app indicate it is much better at this now. 

I do miss the sleep tracking, but maybe it would be good to reduce the amount of self-measurement I'm doing in my life for a while. The downside is that I have to remember to take my phone with me whenever I'm on a walk, but then again my wrist is also freed up so maybe that kind of balances out?

I now have 2 nonusable Fitbit Charge 2 trackers and a bunch of extra straps and a couple of chargers. I will put them into a box and try not to think about them for a while.
