title: On Note-Taking
---

I've never been very good at note-taking. In fact in high school and college I had a bit of pride in getting through many of my classes without bothering to take notes. It's not a skill I ever really developed.

I think part of it is because I have always had terrible penmanship. When I was young my teachers would always write "improve penmanship!" in my notebooks. And I always found it tiring whenever I had to write long essays or lab reports by hand. [There has not been much progress since then](/2013/11/10152562972158912-0/).

The dawn of digital note-taking tools has been a godsend, but that didn't happen until I was already working. So in terms of note-taking for the purpose of studying or learning, it's just a skill I never developed. Even when I do take notes (usually using digital tools), they tend to be random and haphazard and not at all complete. I would not make a good scribe of meeting minutes.

If I had a chance to send some advice back to my younger self, it would have been to take more notes and write more journals (and preserve them for the future).

That being said, these days I do enjoy reading other people's post about note-taking and notebooks and such. It fascinates me maybe because it feels like a world that's out of reach for me. This post is mostly an excuse for a link dump of note-taking-related posts.

[Marc Weidenbaum: Notes on Note-taking](https://disquiet.com/2023/01/06/notes-on-note-taking/) outlines a mostly digital practice. I tried doing something like this a few years ago, but couldn't really keep it up.

[Billy Openheimer: Notecard system](https://billyoppenheimer.com/notecard-system/): A very thorough physical card-based note system. This sort of thing would be impossible for me, but I would happily peruse it if I got the chance.

[Sasha Chapin: Notes Against Note-Taking Systems](https://sashachapin.substack.com/p/notes-against-note-taking-systems). Lots of great insights here about things that may or may not work for you notes-wise.

[Tracy Durnell: A note-gathering and idea-making process](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/05/19/a-note-gathering-and-idea-making-process/) collates some ideas from a few other sources.

[Clive Thompson: How I Take Notes When Iâ€™m Doing Research](https://clivethompson.medium.com/how-i-take-notes-when-im-doing-research-65e6813febc2) (requires a Medium login): My main takeaway from this one is that I should try to do some synthesis after reading something, to better impress the ideas in my mind. Sort of like these short blurbs I'm writing for each link!

[Jamie Rubin: Four lessons from four decades of note-taking](https://jamierubin.net/2023/06/25/the-most-practical-skill/). Four decades! My favorite part is how he had a teacher that taught him note-taking skills at an early age. If only I had a similar teacher! He lists out 4 principles: "Clearly label the subject of the notes", "Don't erase", "Don't throw anything away" and "Date every page".

[Julian.digital: A Meta-Layer for Notes](https://julian.digital/2020/09/04/a-meta-layer-for-notes/): Starts with a discussion of a notes feature in the Hey email app, but expounds that idea into a theoretical OS-level meta layer for notes. Sounds nice, but not sure if I could get into such a thing.

[Austin Kleon: The importance of revisiting notebooks](https://austinkleon.com/2017/12/15/on-the-importance-of-revisiting-notebooks/). This reminds me to re-read my notes on books every so often. I do re-read my own journals and blog posts a lot though!

Cool notebooks / sketchbooks:

These days I mostly consider this blog and website as my public notebook, and it is much more organized than my private, unpublished notes which are mostly scattered across journal entries, google keep, text files, etc. One of my eventual goals would be that anything I have noted of interest that can be published publicly into the blog / website eventually makes it here. This is why I did this linkdump!
