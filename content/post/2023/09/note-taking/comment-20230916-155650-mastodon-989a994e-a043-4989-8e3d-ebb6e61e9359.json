It was all pen and A6 paper. Once I figured out how Zettelkasten worked, that's the only time I introduced Obsidian into it.</p><p>Zettelkasten is actually quite easy to figure out. One idea per A6 page (not sheet). Give it an ID and a keyword or two. Write ID+keyword to index. File. Repeat.</p><p>Small sheets keep your thoughts short and concise while being able to stand on its own.</p><p>That's all there is to it.</p>",
