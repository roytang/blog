I don't know why I did it.

It just sort of happened as I was finishing a late-night sandwich one Saturday. I had a sudden urge to go out for a walk. It was almost eleven in the evening then, which wasn't really an issue since people in my home are generally awake up to one or two o'clock. It's just that I wasn't sure why I wanted to go out. Part of the reason was because I was full, and I wanted to walk around a bit before going to bed. I guess part of me needed some time alone to think. While I usually did my thinking as I lay on my bed sleeping, it hadn't been working the past week or so, so I probably thought a quiet walk by myself would do me some good.

I gave my mother an excuse about going out to buy chips. She usually buys chips (for snacks) once a week for the whole family, but this week she had neglected to buy the ones I liked. There was an all-night supermarket nearby, so I could usually go buy food or whatever at any time. With that, I put on some clothes and made my way outside.

I made my way down the streets that led outside of our subdivision. As I turn the first corner, a nearby street lamp flickers on, as if it had been waiting for someone to pass by. There aren't many voices to be heard--people in our part of the subdivision were generally asleep by 9 or 10. As I rounded that bend that led out of the subdivision, I started to see some other people. Several unsavory-looking young men mingling near small roadside stores that were still open; a young couple apparently on their way home; a young lady calling someone through her cellphone. 

I finally reach the entrance gate to the subdivision. As I turn down the main road just beyond the gate, I realize that I have yet to see most of our area at this time of night. We had just moved here little less than a year ago, and only now have I had the chance to take a late night stroll, as I often used to do back in our old neighborhood. Unless of course you consider those times I came home after midnight, but those didnt really count since I would usually have been too tired to notice anything. The thing I enjoyed most about these night-time walks was the chance for a leisurely stroll, going along at my own pace, taking in what I see on the streets, at the same time going over my own thoughts and reflections.

The first thing I notice is the traffic, or lack of it. I usually commute along this road during the day, when it's an irritating cornucopia of noise, dust, smog and jeepneys. Right now it was near empty, with the occasional car or taxi passing by. Would that it could be like this during the day.

Another thing I wonder about is what stores are still open at this time. Predictable, there were three network gaming shops still open. I stopped outside one of them and took a peek inside. As I suspected, all the seats were taken by young men no doubt not wanting to waste a single second of their precious weekend time. Most of the other stores were closed, save for a billiards hall and the odd motor shop. 

It took me a good ten minutes to reach the next major intersection, where the main road crossed with a wider road. The all-night supermarket was just beyond this intersection, behind a fastfood restaurant that seemed to be in the middle of shutting down for the night. As I looked around, I saw another nearby supermarket, which was also still open. Although my mother often went there, I myself had never purchased anything there, so I decided to give it a go. 

During the day, this intersection usually featured a maddening gridlock of vehicles competing for space, but tonight, it may as well have been an a park. I crossed the near-deserted intersection and approached the place. The sign above the entrance said it was open until midnight, a mere forty minutes away. I make my way in, ignoring the strange look the security guard gives me. It doesn't take me long to find the section with chips, brand after brand stored in a gleaming array of plastic. I look around, but couldn't find the one I was looking for. I decided to ask the young man arranging items on a nearby shelf. As he shows me to what I'm looking for, I can't help but wonder about the circumstances that made this young man work like this in the middle of the night. I thanked him and went to pay for my chips.

I leave the supermarket with my purchases, ignoring the looks of the tricycle drivers just outside who no doubt want some of my business. I'll walk, thank you, I decide as I cross the intersection again. I look around and wonder if I should tarry a bit before heading back, perahps explore a few side streets to see what i can see. But no, the engineer in me says, time's a wastin'. My walk had proven fruitful, as several ideas and approaches to some of my problems ahd sprung to mind as I walked. So I decided to head home posthaste, while the ideas were still fresh to my mind.

I pass the same few open stores uneventfully. Ten minutes later, I stride through the subdivision gate, with a brief nod to the security guard. The same unsavory-looking group was still hanging around at the store near the gate; a young couple were seated just outside one of the homes I passed, talking sweet nothings to each other. As I near my home, avoiding the occasional dog, I sigh. It was a rather quiet walk, which was what I expected, but probably not what I had hoped. Secretly I had been hoping that some excitement would happen along the way to relieve me of some of my boredom and stress, but such was not to be.

Finis.
