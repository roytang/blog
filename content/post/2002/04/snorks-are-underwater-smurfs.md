Hey, we have cable again! Okay, so we never actually \_lost\_ cable, but it felt like we had, back when the Star network withdrew its channels from Home Cable around six months ago. Now they're back, which means I once again get to watch Simpsons, Futurama and Whose Line Is It Anyway? =)

In other news, I'm still unemployed and cashless. =(
