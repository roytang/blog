Because when I get to read this, I felt that history repeats its self. It is not that exact though but we have quite a similar case. \n\nIf you have time, kindly reply to my email pikapika2501@yahoo.com because I have alot of questions and I wanted to share my experience to you.\n\nAnd one of my question would be, what&#39;s your job right now and how are you? LOL, I wanted to know what happen to people having this pissing off experience.\n\nThank you very much.",
