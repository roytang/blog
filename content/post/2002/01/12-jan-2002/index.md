Updates: Added Square NES ROMs, Programming section, updated links. Went back to text-based navigation. While image navigation is nice, it's hard to update and slow-loading. Added links to funtrivia trivia quizzes.

It's been a slow couple of days really. Some board reviewing, sporadic Japanese learning. Finished DW7 a couple of nights ago &#8212; finally! Currently playing on PS: Ehrgeiz Quest Mode! Kinda tough, tho. For the NES, a discussion on FFFade me download a whole bunch of Square NES ROMs! Also been playing a lot of Megaman! (finished 1 and 2 already, on my way with 3) Job fair next week atUP Eng'g. Also came down with a bad cold.
