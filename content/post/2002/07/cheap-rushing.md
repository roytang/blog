[Posted on the [GameFAQs message board][1]
  
in response to endless whining about rushes.

Last I heard, Battle.net had a competitive ladder system,
  
meaning if you want to go up on the ladder, you have to win. If
  
rushing is the means for that win, you should go for it.

What does this mean? If you don't want to be rushed, don't
  
play on Battle.net, because on Battle.net people play primarily
  
to win and secondarily for fun.

Get a bunch of friends together and hook up a LAN and play
  
amongst yourselves, where you can have your own rules like "No
  
rushing!" or "Announce before attacking!" or "No building fifty
  
million towers!"

If you insist on playing on Battle.net, don't play 3v3 or 4v4;
  
it's in these formats that rushing is a very viable strategy. I
  
find that 2v2 is best, as there is little human interaction in
  
1v1.

If you think that rushing makes the game "no fun", then maybe
  
you should be playing another game. Warcraft III is a *strategy
  
game*, the "fun" is in finding strategies to beat your opponent.
  
Rushing is a strategy, just like any other, and it can be
  
defeated just like any other strategy (otherwise 100% of people
  
would be rushing, which isn't true)

Do you always get beaten by rushes? Maybe you should look at
  
your build order to see how you could improve speed-wise or get
  
more defense early on. Look at replays to see how people beat off
  
rushes. Scout ahead to know they are coming. Practice against two
  
or more computer opponents to test yourself. The key to improving
  
is not to whine about things that are "cheap" or "no fun" but to
  
study ways to beat those things.

As a note, I am not a rusher. Not often anyways. I will rush
  
every so often, but only for variation. I attack when I can,
  
creep when I can, and tech as fast as possible.
