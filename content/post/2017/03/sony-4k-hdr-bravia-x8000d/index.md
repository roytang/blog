4k XLocal tech blog YugaTech is doing a [giveaway of a Sony X8000D Bravia 4K TV][1]. To be honest&nbsp;I wasn't sure about using this blog to participate in a promo, but I was already in the market for a new TV since our&nbsp;living room TV is already starting to have some problems.

I checked out the [product features of the Sony X8000D Bravia on their website][2]. Some of the features stood out for me specifically:

  * 4K HDR -- this means you get to watch high definition 4k videos. Perfect for those who really enjoy high quality displays. The TV also comes with some technologies to enhance your viewing experience such as 4k X-Reality and Triluminos display.&nbsp;And if you have a gamer in the family, this means you can now maximize the Playstation 4 Pro since it supports gaming in 4K resolution!
  * Connectivity -- Wifi is a big deal for me because our current TV is a bit old and only supports wired connection. Wifi makes it a lot easier! The TV also has 4 HDMI slots -- let me see...  that's one each for the PS4 Pro, Nintendo Switch, and XBox One, plus one more to spare for those times when you want to connect your laptop to a big&nbsp;display&nbsp;(one can dream right?)
  * Android TV -- this means all the apps on the Google Play store can be downloaded and run on the TV. That means built-in Youtube, Netflix, etc, without need for a&nbsp;separate device to stream from!
  * Google Cast -- oh, I didn't know this even existed until now! Apparently TV's can now have Chromecast functionality built-in, without the need for the separate Chromecast device. Awesome! We can just send content from our mobile devices&nbsp;directly to the TV!
  * Netflix recommended -- one of the things I've been looking for in a new TV is that I want my folks to be able to easily use my Netflix account. Currently the only way they can use it on the TV is through the PS4, which is a bit difficult if you don't know your way around a controller. Having the TV itself support Netflix will make it a lot easier for my parents to take advantage of Netflix's library of movies and TV shows!
  * X-Protection PRO -- to protect against power surges, this seems like it would be really good especially here in Metro Manila where power supply is not always the most stable. Added protection for your investment!

The model has a lot of other features designed to enhance your enjoyment of audio and video content. With all of these features, the Sony Bravia X8000D&nbsp;could definitely be the perfect home entertainment companion for the modern family!
