My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1941667381">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I realize that the Thrawn trilogy is no longer canon, what with The Force Awakens and all. But I remember reading an interview with Zahn in Inquest Magazine a lifetime ago and how his trilogy was one of the best parts of the extended universe so when I found a used copy I picked it up. <br /><br />The story is pretty good, taking place 5 years after Jedi, and explores what happens to the galaxy and the efforts of the Empire remnants to mount a comeback. A far cry from what Disney eventually approved to be the canon storyline of course :)
