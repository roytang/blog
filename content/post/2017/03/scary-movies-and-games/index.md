I'm not a fan of scary movies. I don't appreciate the idea of paying money to get surprised by jump scares or whatever.

Back when I was a kid I remember my dad watching a _Betamax_ copy of [The Gate][1] back home and me and my younger brother were watching with him and the movie seriously creeped me out. There was this one scene where a demonic eye manifested on the lead kid's palm and that scene stuck with me for a while. (Maybe some latent form of trypophobia -- don't google it.)

Slasher movies I find a bit more acceptable -- I watched a few of them in the 90s like _Scream_ and _I Know What You Did Last Summer_. But the really creepy stuff like _The Ring _and similar films I'm not particularly interested in.

For scary video games, we played a few of them back on the PC when we were young. The most memorable would definitely be [Waxworks][2], a kind of point-and-click with first-person grid-exploration horror game. I remember my brother and I would play it late at night while the folks were out. There was one time we had to stop because we had been surprised at the sudden appearance of some bad guy in the pyramid stage. We had to turn off the PC and run out to the _sari-sari _store so that we had some people to talk to. We eventually managed to finish this game, but I think after that part we refrained from playing too late in the night. LOL.

I also played the original jump scare game, Alone in the Dark although I never got into the succeeding series like Resident Evil. These days I don't bother with scary games anymore. Sometimes I consider playing stuff like Amnesia, but I'm sure even if I'm a grown-up I'd still get creeped out by some of the stuff and that's not really how I like to be entertained.
