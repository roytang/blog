At any point in time, what you are doing can be grouped into one of four buckets:

  1. Planning
  2. Executing a plan
  3. Reacting to something
  4. Relaxing (leisure time)

Overthinkers tend to do too much of #1. The most efficient people probably spend most of their time in #2. People whose lives are chaotic do too much of #3. Almost all people don'tÂ get enough #4. (I might be doing too much of #4~)
