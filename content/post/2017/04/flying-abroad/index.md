title: Flying Abroad

Maybe someday flying abroad won't be like this 

> "My flight is at 1130, I need to be there by 830am. I better go to sleep early. I'll set 3
> alarms to make sure I wake up on time."
> 
> (wakes up too early)
> 
> "Oh, none of my alarms have even gone off yet. But I'm already up, might as well take
> a shower already."
> 
> (5am)
> 
> "Still too early ... might as well triple check all my stuff ... "
> 
> (6am)
> 
> "It takes an hour to get to the airport ... but since I'm already ready I might as well go
> early in case of traffic problems."
> 
> (spends 5 hours at the airport for a 4 hour flight)
