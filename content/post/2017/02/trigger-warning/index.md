My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1905365439">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Some of these are creepy af, but this is my second Gaiman short story collection so I mostly knew what to expect. The man is a master at putting together words though. I could only aspire to be so good.
