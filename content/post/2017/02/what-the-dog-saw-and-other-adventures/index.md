My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1919268914">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I don't even know when I started reading this, I've had a bookmark in it for maybe three or four years now. It's a collection of Gladwell's articles from the New Yorker, so that's to be expected - not exactly designed to be consumed all in one sitting. The book is Gladwell's usual mix of anecdotes spun into pop psychology and meant to make you ask questions or suggest some insight about this or that. It's entertaining enough to read, even though it doesn't really go into much detail about any one topic.
