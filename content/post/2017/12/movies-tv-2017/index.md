This is an archive of movies/TV I watched in 2017 that haven't otherwise had blog posts, scrobbled together from social media posts.

### Movies

#### Arrival (2017)

<time>[2017-02-18 23:57] </time> Arrival spoiler-free review:

- first half a bit boring
- Forrest Whitaker is hard to understand
- not sure if it was just the cinema I was at, but the audio and the lighting seemed quite bad at some points
- that being said, the movie was ok. I think it's comparable to, but not as good as, Interstellar
- if you watch it with people who don't pay attention, you'll have to explain stuff

#### Logan (2017)

<time>[2017-03-04 15:47] </time> Right. I watched Logan yesterday.

LOGAN Spoiler-Free review:

- great movie. Best of the Wolverine trilogy, easily
- the tone is very different from any previous X-men movies. I'd say it's closer to something like John Wick
- good send-off for Jackman and Stewart, since this is their last movie in these roles. Stewart finally given more acting to do than just sitting in a chair being bald and pretending to think at you
- very, very violent and lots of swearing. Don't bring your kids
- no, it doesn't really follow the Old Man Logan comicbook storyline
- need to listen closely to dialogue to figure out what is implied to have happened to the X-men
- Post-credits scene: I was told there wasn't any, and I really had to pee, so I didn't wait for it -_-
- Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Probably not!
- IMAX or not? I did not go IMAX, and I don't think the movie would have been significantly improved by IMAX or 3d

#### Deep Impact (1998)

<time>[2017-03-16 10:15] </time> Deep Impact on NF. This movie is so much better than armageddon

#### Wonder Woman (2017)

<time>[2017-06-06 00:42] </time> Wonder Woman spoiler-free review:

- First act was best, second act was okay, third act/resolution a bit weak (and really kind of super obvious/predictable)
- The parallels with the first Captain American movie, especially in the 3rd act, are uncanny
- great battle/stunt choreography, especially in the first act
- Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright gave excellent performances
- Definitely better than Man of Steel/Dawn of Justice
- Not better than TDK/Logan. Come on people!
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly!
- Post-credits scenes: None

#### Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017)

<time>[2017-07-07 17:46] </time> Spider-man Homecoming Spoiler-free review:

- This movie is amazing. Possibly best in all MCU so far. It's fun, it's exciting, unexpected things happened. Maybe not watching the trailers helped lol
- Covers a lot of ground the previous Spider-man movies didn't. Helped along by not needing to rehash the origin story for the Nth time
- Lots of great call outs for the comic book fans
- I was worried about the Vulture, but it was handled very well. Keaton is great here.
- This movie is tightly coupled to the MCU yo. IDK how they're going to handle it if Sony breaks it off after the two-movie deal. By they I mean Sony. Obviously MCU can just ignore him forever afterwards.
- TBH I was also really worried about the MCU coupling and having too much Iron Man in the movie, but it turned out okay. Maybe could have had a little bit less Tony Stark.
- IMAX? Probably not worth it.
- there's a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene.
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Possibly! There's some shaky cam footage near the start that can be a bit nauseating though

#### Thor Ragnarok (2017)

<time>[2017-10-24 22:34] </time> THOR RAGNAROK spoiler-free review:

- a fun, action-packed romp that shakes up the Thor status quo significantly
- easily the best of the three Thor movies
- a number plot points are fairly predictable, yet still fun
- the Marvel formula is generally action mixed with witty banter here and there, and it's what we get here, although some of the jokes feel like they're stretched a bit too much
- some great-looking cinematic scenes here and there. One particular flashback scene looked really great
- I kind of like how the older franchises need to be some sort of team effort nowadays. Like Civil War, this felt a bit like some kind of mini-Avengers crossover -- in space!
- speaking of space, one of the positive things about this installment is that they didn't feel the need to tie Thor's adventures to Earth anymore (not that the movie is 100% Earth-free), and they get to go a bit wild with space and aliens and all that
- I understand the need to highlight Hulk's involvement as part of the film's marketing, but man, it would have been so awesome to just find out right then and there
- This movie had that Star Wars: Last Jedi trailer I was trying to avoid D:
- 1 mid-credits scene and 1 post-credits scene
- I think Imax was good for this movie. The 3d wasn't too much and it definitely made some scenes pop. The film is a visual delight so I think the larger screen is important too
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. Maybe I should stop including this section kasi parang same na parati ang answer. Unless for some reason I decide to watch some Tagalog romcom

#### Justice League (2017)

<time>[2017-11-17 23:11] </time> JUSTICE LEAGUE Spoiler-Free Review:

- Movie was OKAY. Started out fine, build-up was good, kind of surprised with what happened in the middle, then a disappointing conclusion
- Movie was SHORT. IMDB says 120 minutes but my watch told me it was &lt; 2h. Probably could have spent more time putting the team together or setting up the characters or such
- the movie does pander a lot to comic/DC fans; Batman/Superman themes play in the background when they first appear; References to some other DC characters during the exposition, etc
- Ugh Steppenwolf so boring and terrible
- I think Ezra Miller and Gal Gadot were the best here out of the lead roles. 
- A number of fight scenes reminded me of Injustice
- the best part of this movie was the Black Panther trailer that I somehow hadn't seen or heard of yet
- for some reason the other comic book movie that came to mind was X-Men Apocalupse
- Gary Oldman should play JJJ in the next Spider-Man so that he and JK Simmons will have effectively role-swapped
- one mid credits scene for fun and one end credits scene as a portent of things that may come later
- Imax was okay. There was one scene where I instinctively moved my head to avoid an incoming projectile
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: It's very much a fantasy action movie so probably not. 
- we still get Batman with guns and Superman who threatens to kill
- no title drop and no Superfriends reference = LAME

#### The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King

<time>[2017-12-10 01:27] </time> For some reason I rewatched the ending of Return of the King today. If Game of Thrones doesn't have an ending as epic and as conclusive as this, it would be such a big waste

#### Star Wars Episode VIII: The Last Jedi (2017)

<time>[2017-12-14 00:42] </time> THE LAST JEDI Spoiler-free (promise) review:

- great movie, but there was this weird draggy part around the middle that they maybe could have done away with
- my brother whom I watched with says he thinks it was the best Star Wars movie ever. I'm not sure
- Adam Driver needs to either speak up or work around his accent a bit
- because we didn't plan this movie outing so well, we ended up with terrible seats (i.e. very first row, slightly off-center) in the Imax theater. I think the Imax was fine, but being so up close made for some weird angles sometimes and sometimes the 3d didn't work so well from where we were seated. And medyo nakakapagod sa mata. Never again!
- walang post-credit scene lol

### TV

#### Designated Survivor season 1

<time>[2017-05-21 23:38] </time> Designated Survivor: I like the parts where Tom Kirkman is dealing with day-to-day governance issues. It's not gritty politics like House of Cards, it's kind of the opposite - Kirkman is very much the kind of altruistic statesman the world could use right now. And occasionally he manages to beat the system too.   The conspiracy parts with Maggie Q were okay, except that the resolution turned out to be really lame. TBF, resolving conspiracy plots is difficult; the tendency is either (a) overly-complicated conspiracies with multiple layers that get drawn out until the series gets cancelled (see: X-Files); (b) overly-simple conspiracies with lame resolutions

#### Freaks and Geeks

<time>[2017-06-28 22:51] </time> Finished binging Freaks and Geeks on @Netflix ...wow, that was a series that ended too soon

#### Defenders

<time>[2017-08-20 09:04] </time> DEFENDERS spoiler-free review and episode guide:

(Okay, maybe a teensy little spoiler in that image - but I couldn't resist lol)

- this series moves forward each of the four protaganists
- you get to see most of the supporting cast come back and maybe even get a teeny bit of development in
- the plot is reasonably tight, i had a few minor nitpicks but now i can't even remember most of them
- Maybe it's just the fanboy in me, but I was really excited when they met each other for the first time
- Jessica Jones still the best character
- Iron Fist still the weakest point (see the image), but it's not as bad as it was in his own series. It helps that he's not surrounded by the weird Meachum family and has a better ensemble to work off of. I also really enjoyed how enthusiastic he was at getting a team together
- fight scenes are pretty good (at least better than in the Iron Fist series - also it's still weird that Daredevil fights a lot better than Iron Fist. He must have been a real slacker during that decade in Kun'Lun)
- I suspect you can come in cold without watching any of the previous series, they do bring up their backstories a lot
- I'm disappointed that there was no title drop

Episode guide:

- ep1 ok
- ep2 great
- ep3 great
- ep4 great
- ep5 draggy, this was the weakest ep for me
- ep6 ok
- ep7 good
- ep8 great. there's a post-credits scene
