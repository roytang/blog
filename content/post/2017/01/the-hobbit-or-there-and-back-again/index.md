My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1867502912">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Starting the year off right with some Tolkien. The book is unapologetic about how it drags both unsuspecting Bilbo and the reader down a long adventure that includes a lot of singing and being captured and being almost eaten. I'm not sure how they managed to stretch it into three movies though, the book isn't particularly long.
