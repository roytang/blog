Back in the day [Ninang Flor](/2014/07/10153116875948912/) sold [Funny Komiks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilipino_FUNNY_Komiks) at the sari-sari store and she had a contact at the publisher, so she would be able to use her connections to get us Kamias kids appearances in those issues. My mom had preserved the ones of me, so I shared them on the socials.
