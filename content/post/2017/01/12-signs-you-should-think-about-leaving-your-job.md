A lot of people feel trapped in their current job. They feel that they will be unable to find better or at least similar work and will rather stay than risk it. It's a false sense of "job security" vs fear. It might be true that you have no good options. But if you're not looking at all, it's 100% surely true.

Even if you don't find better options, the act of looking for them helps you through some sort of catharsis. It confirms if you really have no choice but to stay. It helps you understand your place in the job market and what you can do to improve your position and maybe open up more options later on.

Bottom line: if you're unhappy in any way (as indicated by any of the signs above), you should at least be looking. Otherwise you are doing yourself a disservice.
