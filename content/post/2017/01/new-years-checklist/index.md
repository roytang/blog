In no particular order:

  * Greet your loved ones and friends and anyone else you hold dear. Maybe even those you disagree with
  * Ponder why people give so much significance to the transition between an arbitrarily-chosen pair of 24 hour periods
  * Take stock and reflect on the past year
  * Think about what you'd like to learn this year or how you want to improve
  * Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful
  * Change your passwords
  * Buy a new toothbrush
  * Make a New Year's joke ("My New Year's Resolution is 1440&#215;900!")
  * Set a target of how many books you'll read in 2017
  * Choose the first book to read
  * Throw away a few things you no longer need
  * Make a list of where you will travel to in 2017
  * Check out what movies are coming out this year and which ones you want to watch
  * Audit your financials -- where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc
  * Make another New Year's joke ("I haven't taken a bath since last year!")
  * Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that's gathered there over the past year
  * Make a list of projects you want to do in 2017
  * Choose something from the past year that you're going to stop watching or doing
  * Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great.
  * Remember that there's a new episode of Sherlock today (well January 1 in the UK)
  * Get rid of 2016 calendars
  * Make a list for the new year!
