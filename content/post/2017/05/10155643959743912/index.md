title: America will collapse one day

[Duterte: America will collapse one day](http://news.abs-cbn.com/news/05/19/17/duterte-america-will-collapse-one-day)

I don't disagree that the US will collapse one day. What's questionable is claiming that multi-racial diversity is a problem that would be the cause of such a collapse. After all, one of the most stable Asian countries, Singapore, is also one of the most diverse.

In evolution, genetic diversity is important because it means more chances that the population might be able to survive in the same way. I'd imagine cultural diversity is valuable for the same reason. It might mean that there is a bit more management overhead to get everyone working together well, but it's probably worth it.

(Re: US collapsing, more likely cause would be extreme capitalistic greed causing the system to fall apart from the inside)

Kind of related: I just watched a TED talk that suggested that being closed-minded towards other cultures/races tends to be stronger in conservatives. Really shows why our president gets along with the current US president, maybe.
