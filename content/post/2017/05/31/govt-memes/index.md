title: Today in Unintentionally Hilarious Government Generated Memes

First, Duterte's Presidential Communications Office (formerly [twitter/@PresidentialCom](https://twitter.com/PresidentialCom)) shared on the socials a very poorly animated video about "threats to society" from insurgents etc and suggesting we needed martial law. 

On <time>[May 31, 2017, 5:32 p.m.](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/10155670973313912)</time> I wrote:

The backlash was quick and unfortunately the post was almost immediately deleted (leaving my post above without context) but not quick enough to stop memes being born out of it! An edited version of the video was posted [by The Corpus Juris](https://twitter.com/thecorpusjuris/status/869895710354714626). I will embed a copy here until I can find a copy of the original (hopefully someday! I have [asked about it on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1kzqiab/eight_years_ago_the_presidential_comms_office/).).

Edit: A helpful redditor has provided links to the original video (see the comments section below), so now the original video is also archived here in this post! (See above!)

Second, later in the day over on the other side of the pacific, Donald Trump had [his famous covfefe moment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covfefe).

It's kinda hilarious that these happened on the same day (more or less, given time zones). Preserving here some memes I shared at the time (with some crossover even!):
