I watched *Community* liberally from 2011 until the series hobbled to an end in 2015's season 6. I enjoyed most of the series and still rewatch a lot of clips, but they never really recovered from the dip in season 3 and season 1 and 2 remain the highlights.

<time>[2014-05-10 07:13] </time> I love Community, but let's face it, even the 5th season didn't get close to how good seasons 1 and 2 were. The only episode I really liked was the GI Joe was (because knowing is half the battle wut) #darkesttimeline

<time>[2017-01-10 17:07] </time> Community predicted the problems with rating people on social media in 2013, 3 years before Black Mirror's "Nosedive". It's like Community was streets ahead!
