I haven't had much time to write recently. Been busy. (I'll write about that some other time.) But I've kind of been posting regularly on this date for a while, so here we are.

Ah, time. And the inexorable passage thereof. There's some kind of big milestone for me in around three hundred and sixty-five more solar cycles. Well, I don't personally consider it big, since that's kind of arbitrary. But as people are wont to say, life begins...  maybe I'll save that for next year.

This year, kind of at a crossroads. Considering where to go and the way forward. Trying out some things. Figuring out what's important and what's not and what one would be willing to give up.

In all honesty there's a good chance that in another year's time, I still wouldn't have figured anything out. Maybe that's what life is though. A constant struggle of figuring out where to go next.

And so it goes.
