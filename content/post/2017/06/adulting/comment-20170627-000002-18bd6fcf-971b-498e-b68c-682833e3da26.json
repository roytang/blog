Actually, being an adult means being responsible for oneself and for someone else. Making decisions and making sacrifices, and understanding others more.   Some of us each reach adulthood sooner than others, even before the age of 18: my brothers and sisters took care of their younger sibs, including me, and they transitioned naturally to living their own lives. (I myself took awhile to be more mature and I owe it to my sibs  ;-)  )  Btw Roy, thanks for taking this role  :-)  it&#x27;s not an easy one, but I&#x27;m glad it inspired you. Cheers!",
