### Dragon Quest IX: Sentinel of the Starry Skies

Finished: UNFINISHED!

Playtime: 39:27

{{< photos dq9 >}}

I played this game in 2010, and all this time I thought/misremembered that I had finished this game, but this save I loaded is proof otherwise! The "story so far" screenshot implies I stopped right before the very final boss for some reason. But the save loads back in Alltrades Abbey. Did I retreat to heal up before facing the final boss?!? I ended up going to the final dungeon and confirming that yep, the final boss is not yet defeated!

I have a vague recollection of the story of this where you're some kind of celestial being/"angel" trying to figure out what happened to the world. 
[HLTB](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/2817) says Dragon Quest IX takes 47.5 hours to beat the main story, so I probably need like 8 more hours of grinding to get there! Completionist runs are rated at 742 hours so I'm glad I didn't attempt that!

I did enjoy this game, I think. I managed to scavenge some notes on the game from that time (2010):

- [Jul 11](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/143064785707651): Anyone else playing DQ9 on the NDS? Please explain the wifi stuff to me. (Later)) Apparently it only uses local adhoc wifi, I was hoping it would use the internet wifi.
- Jul 21: DQ9 is pretty fun, with all the need for switching jobs and reseting levels to easily get skill points.
- Jul 25: Wow I got captured! I feel like I always get captured in DQ games. Funny though, after being captured I was still carrying all my equipment
- Jul 31: Dragon Quest IX is also going fine. When my glasses broke I played a couple of hours of it since I could play it without eyeglasses and not be stupid. There are still a lot of places on the map I couldn't reach - don't I get any flying thingy? It would be silly if I only got one in the post game.
- Aug 01: I realized I have also more or less not used any FAQs for Dragon Quest IX. There was a single instance where I needed to know what was the best place to hunt for Metal Slimes, but that's it. So I'm pretty much conquering this game myself (although as mentioned, I don't really understand the treasure map mechanic...maybe I should read a manual?)
- Aug 20: Dragon Quest IX - I should finish this game. It's an open loop.
- Aug 25: The save file I loaded from the R4 has this date, so presumably that was the last time I played the game and I never bothered picking it back up again!
