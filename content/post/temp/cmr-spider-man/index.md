### Previously

This is the part 17 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). 

I was originally planning to do a Captain America post next, but I wanted to read some Spider-Man. I knew for a fact that I had already read all issues of *Amazing Spider-Man*, so instead I decided to go through the entire *Spectacular Spider-Man* run from the 70s-90s, plus some other Spider-Man stuff.

### Spectacular Spider-Man v1 (1968)

- #1-2 (1968)

V1 was a black and white magazine that came out every 3 months but only lasted 2 issues. I think the stories as presented here are out of continuity, though they would be later edited and reprinted in-continuity.

### Spectacular Spider-Man v2 (1976)

- 264 issues: #1-#163, -1 (1976-1998)
- 15 annuals

Spectacular Spider-Man v2 was the first time Marvel had a second solo ongoing series for a character, and was actually the second spin-off Spider-Man series (the first being *Marvel Team-Up*, which always featured Spidey teamed with another Marvel character). Initially titled *Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man*, it was eventually retitled to the easier *Spectacular Spider-Man* from #134 forward, which I much prefer.

It's a bit fun to note how careful with continuity Marvel was during these early years of a character appearing in multiple books; practically every early issue of SSM has a note or dialogue that references events happening in the main book *Amazing Spider-Man* just to make sure continuity lines up. These days characters like Wolverine can appear in five different books with different ongoing stories and status quos and it's just handwaved away as those stories happening at different times!

Despite that, the early years of SSM were pretty good at keeping their story arcs separate from ASM. This is great from a serial reader standpoint since I don't have to switch titles for crossover stories or whatever, but you'll see from my notes below it didn't last.

Some highlights to the whole run noted below:

#### Some Issues I Had As a Kid

When I was young, my parents often bought me random single comic issues without regard to continuity or whatever. Most of them have been lost to time and I don't have issue numbers or similar details, but while I'm doing this Complete Marvel Run I'm always on the lookout for them. I found some of them here!

{{< photos oldissues >}}

Spectacular Spider-Man #65: Spider-Man fights Kraven and Calypso. This was the first time I read about Kraven.

Spectacular Spider-Man #79: Dr Octopus assaults Black Cat at the hospital. I vividly remembered the scene where Spider-Man uses his webs to stop a falling elevator.

Spectacular Spider-Man #87: Peter unmasks in front of Felicia for the first time. 

#### Cloak and Dagger

*Spectacular Spider-Man #64* (1982)

Teenage superheroes Cloak and Dagger were first introduced in this book and made a few appearances throughout the run. They were focused on drug-dealing criminals.

#### The Spot

*Spectacular Spider-Man #99* (1985)

Okay, I'm only highlighting this one because I thought Spidey's initial reaction to the Spot was hilarious and took a screenshot:

{{< photos spot >}}

#### The Death of Jean DeWolffe

*Spectacular Spider-Man #107-110* (1985)

This story arc often appears in listings of best Spider-Man storylines. I've read it at least once before; it hit a lot harder this time now that I've read the series from the start. Jean DeWolffe was a rare ally to Spider-Man among the police. This story arc would have been akin to Batman investigating Jim Gordon being brutally murdered by a serial killer. Of note is that this arc was done by a very young Peter David early in his career.

#### Kraven's Last Hunt

*Spectacular Spider-Man #131â€“132* (1987)

Yet another story arc that often appears in "best of" lists. This was a six-part storyline by J.M. DeMatteis that ran across all 3 ongoing Spider-Man books at the time: ASM, SSM, and the relatively new *Web of Spider-Man*. I believe I have read the whole of this before, though for this re-read, I only covered the SSM parts.

Notably, I believe this is the first instance of a Spider-Man story being broken across his multiple ongoing series, an annoying trend that would only be exacerbated in the 90s.

#### Maximum Carnage

*Spectacular Spider-Man #201-203* (1993)

Another multi-title crossover, perhaps the worst offender of all. This story arc was a 14-part series that ran across FIVE ongoing Spider-Man books. This crossover is a bit of a mysery to me, as I do remember having read a good chunk of it back in the 90s, but I don't know if I was buying Spider-Man books at the time. I do not have any such Spider-Man issues surviving from that era (my X-Men books from that era have kind of survived), and there was certainly no internet piracy yet at the time, so IDK how I read them. It's possible I read them through a friend, though I'm not sure who among my friends would have been collecting Spider-Man books.

I'm not especially a big fan of this storyline, as I'm not that big on the symbiotes in the first place [^1], but it did give Spidey a chance to work together with Venom (might have been the first time they had to work together) and some other lesser-known heroes. Notably, this was the first time I read about the comic book version of Firestar, who I only knew previously from the *Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends* animated series!

#### 90s Clone Saga

*Spectacular Spider-Man #217-229* (1994-1995)

It took me a while to power through the 90s mostly because of the 90s saga. During this time the crossover storylines across all 4 ongoing Spidey books was happening on a regular basis, effectively merging them into a single weekly title. As I was only covering SSM for this re-read, I often only got 1/4 of the story. 

The whole concept of the 90s clone saga - an attempt by Marvel to replace Peter Parker with Ben Reilly that they later had to walk back - is so confusing in retrospect. The ["Production and Development" section of the Clone Saga wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_Saga#Production_and_development) is enlightening about how editorial and staffing changes and scheduling concerns changed the trajectory of the storyline as it went along. Perhaps the worst example of how not having a single cohesive and authoritative voice behind a character (as indie comics do) can be a disaster in terms of story telling.

#### Return of Norman Osborn

*Spectacular Spider-Man #230-263* (1996-1998)

It was revealed that Norman Osborn was alive and was behind all the machinations of the Clone Saga. The last 2 years of SSM covered a period when Norman attempted to reintegrate to society and tarnish Spider-Man's reputation and clear himself of the Green Goblin allegations.

This volume ends in Sep 1998, as did all the other Spidey ongoing titles at the time, to make way for the *Amazing Spider-Man* relaunch in Nov 1998. Thus ended the longest period of multiple Spider-Man solo titles ongoing at the same time. 

#### Notable Creators

As is typical for long-running series, many creators had a hand in the series. I think Gerry Conway, Bill Mantlo, JM DeMatteis were the notable writers. For me the artwork of the Spectacular Spider-Man period is most characterized by Sal Buscema; I think he worked on about 100 issues total from 1976-1996 and it was fun seeing his iconic renditions of Peter Parker evolve through the years!

### Amazing Spider-Man v7 (2022)

- 72 issues: #1-#70, 65.DEATHS, 68.DEATHS (2022-2025)
- 2 annuals

Covering this here since conveniently this volume is ending around the same time this blog post is going up. Moving forward I'll try to cover more of the newer series as they finish, to avoid having to cover them again later. (More on this below).

ASM was relaunched with a new #1 in 2022 with the creative team of Zeb Wells and John Romita Jr. I'm not a big fan of JRJr these days, as I now find his big blocky heads a bit off-putting. But this run will probably be most remembered (notoriously) for the introduction of Paul, a new love interest for Mary Jane Watson who was much hated by the fandom because it shows how determined editorial is to keep Peter and MJ apart. Paul and MJ even raised some imaginary kids together in an alternate dimension (comics)!

Other signficant events during Wells' run:

- Introduction of Shay, a new love interest for Peter
- #14-#18 [Dark Web crossover](/2023/05/marvel-run-4-thor-etc/#dark-web-2023)
- #17 First appearance of Rek-Rap (I like this character he is silly lol)
- #39-#44 Gang War crossover (see below)
- Peter inheriting Norman Osborn's sins and becoming Spider-Goblin

Zeb Wells run ends with #60. #61-#70 are by Joe Kelly and part of the "8 Deaths of Spider-Man" story arc where the new Sorcerer Supreme (Doom) tasks Spider-Man with defeating champions of Cyttorak.

### Amazing Spider-Man Gang War

- Amazing Spider-Man Gang War: First Strike
- Luke Cage: Gang War #1-4
- Daredevil: Gang War #1-4
- Deadly Hands of Kung Fu: Gang War #1-3

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 367.

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 7

Total issues covered so far: 5,131 + 367 = 5,498

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 35,487 (+210 since the previous post)

Progress: 15.49% (14.54% last post). 

### CMR Notes

- Might want to read early Spider-Man by year
- Might want to read annuals by year
- Include newly finished current series as much as possible

### Up Next

The succeeding era of Hulk will be a challenge to write about, because from here his storyline fragments: Hercules takes over the main title, a new Red Hulk is introduced, etc. I am hoping the next Hulk entry will be the last one, covering 2008-2018. (2018 onwards is already covered since I already read *Immortal Hulk* and the current Hulk volume is still ongoing.) That will be a problem for future me; at the current pace, who knows when we manage to rotate back to Hulk! 

Assuming we are sticking with "MCU order", the next entry should be focused on **Captain America** post-Heroes Reborn.

[^1]: I understand I am going to have read more Venom/Carnage/symbiote stuff eventually as I progress through this run and oh boy that may or may not be fun lol.
