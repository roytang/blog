Random memory for the day:

I remember watching the Superfriends TV series when I was a little kid, and every time Superman would fly off into space, there'd be a shot of the earth as a globe, with Superman flying out from the northern hemisphere. As a stupid kid, I thought to myself, "I wonder why the earth is shown as an oblate spheroid? When I go out with my parents it was obviously flat." (Paraphrasing a bit since when I was a kid I did not know the term "oblate spheroid")

I have always had a curiousÂ  scientific mind of course, and I was able to come up with the only possible rational explanation: The upper half of the sphere must be the atmosphere, and the surface of the world must be inside the sphere on a plane near the equator. That would explain why Superman always flies up from the upper half of the sphere!

It seemed like a brilliant idea at the time.

_(I was thinking of making a mock-up drawing of the above hypothesis and claiming that I drew it when I was four. But Ubuntu doesn't seem to have any simple "Paint" application installed... )_
