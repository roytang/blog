I'm not sure why but I decided to try out the [Flock 2][1] web browser beta, the "social web browser" built on top of Firefox.

This is a test actually. Flock's blog post dialog doesn't seem to provide any category support (it supports tags instead), so I want to see what category this post would go under.
  
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br /> (Update: Flock let me choose a category after I try to publish the post.)</span>

I'm not yet entirely sure what the merits of using Flock are, it seems to be mostly conveniences when using certain webapps. I'm going to try it out for a few days.

</div>
