Never give out any of your confidential usernames and passwords to programs or services that you do not trust completely. This may be a bit obvious to the more tech-savvy, but everybody has to watch out. Luckily, there are even some programmers who are able to catch the work of evil programmers.
  
[Coding Horror has this story about an evil programmer who sold a GMail backup solution that steals your username and password.][1] 

The offending account was reported to Google, but I hope someone brings legal measures against the company who made and/or distributed the evil software.
