Just a quick summary this time:

Round 1: 2-0 win vs UB Faeries

Round 2: 1-2 loss vs Reveillark-Blink (mirror match)

Round 3: 2-0 win vs unknown opponent

Round 4: 0-2 loss vs BUrw Reanimator with Reveillark combo

Round 5: 2-0 win vs Monoblack Aggro

Round 6:1-2 loss vs RB Goblins

The mirror match had a a really bad play from me. We both had Body Doubles that were &#8216;larks, plus each had another random 2/2 flier. I was at six in game three, he was still at twenty, we were both basically in topdeck mode. He swings with six power in the air, I block with my guys to get everyone killed. Big mistake, since he's the Active Player, my trigger resolves first and he gets to Sower whatever I bring back; I bring in two Body Doubles copying Reveillarks; the second mistake was not realizing I that I had a Blink in the yard, could have prevented the Sower trigger and brought back two more guys, a large enough swing that would have been enough to win me the game that I eventually lost.

Anyway, still unsure if I will play this deck at City Champs, as it's very tiring...
