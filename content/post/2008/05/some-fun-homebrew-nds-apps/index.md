I was neglecting the NDS a bit, so I decided to look for some fun homebrew stuff to do with it. Here are some I tried (You'll need some sort of flashcart to use these. Mine is an R4.):

  * [Pocket Physics][1] -- a neat little toy app that allows you to draw diagrams on the touch screen that would then become affected by physics. It's a bit like a free-form [The Incredible Machine][2] that's portable. It's a bit of work to get a nice physics model done, but there are some available for download, you can just view the work of others if you want. 
  * [Colors!][3] -- a painting/sketching app for the DS, you can create images that have a painting feel to them 
  * [ScummVM DS][4] -- SCUMM was the adventure-game engine that drove a lot of the point-and-click adventure games of the 80s such as the Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion games. Provided you have a copy of those games, ScummVM DS allows you to play all those old games on your DS! 


   
There's a whole world of homebrew apps/games out there to explore, these were just the ones I could try out in one sitting. Try [this post from 4-color-rebellion][5] for some recommendations.

For more details, you can also check out the recently concluded [Homebrew Week at DS Fanboy][6].

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to help Guybrush find Big Whoop...
