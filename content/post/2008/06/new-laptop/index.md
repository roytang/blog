Just a bit of an indulgence.

There was a warehouse sale at the office building from Tuesday to Friday. Like every single time I would make a big purchase I waffled undecisively between buying and not buying a laptop for the first four days, only to succumb at the very last minute when a model with an insane price became available.

On 7:30pm of the last day of the sale, I picked up an Acer Aspire 4920 unit with the following specs:

===================================================================

I felt guilty about the impulse buy for a few hours; I didn't really need a laptop of course, and I could upgrade one of the home desktops into a top of the line gaming machine for the same price. Still, I've always wanted a laptop and if I went by that logic I'd never have one!

So yeah I'm using it now, I also bought and setup a wifi router at home as well, so now I get to blog while watching a DVD of 21. I'm also back to using a Windows OS at home, since the laptop comes with Windows Vista Home Premium. I think I'm going to try using Vista and IE for a while and see how long before I decide to wipe and install into an XP/Ubuntu dual boot. At least I get to experience the thrill of being a Windows shill for a while. ðŸ˜€
