Despite the fact the allure of Final Fantasy Tactics PSP, I was still decided on finishing **Advance Wars: Days of Ruin**. This was only the second game in the series that I was playing, although I had greatly enjoyed **Advance Wars: Dual Strike**, so my hopes were high for Days of Ruin.

Pros:

-- Still Advance Wars, battles are fairly good and challenging enough

-- New units: Bike -- infantry on wheels, can capture as well; Flare -- helps in Fog of War situations; Carrier -- revamped from the AWDS Carrier, this one can now create its' own Seaplanes; Antitank -- a ranged unit that can counterattack, strong against Tanks, surprisingly; Duster -- a hybrid air unit that has a weaker ground attack than a Bomber, and weaker air attack than a fighter

-- COs and CO Powers greatly weakened, allowing for battles which don't swing entirely on the back of CO power usage

Cons:

-- No hard campaign? No unlockables? Without the unlockables, I'm not inclined to play through the trial maps, since there's no incentive. (I may still do it at some unspecified point in the future, but when faced with the possibility of playing **Final Fantasy Tactics** instead&#8230;)

-- Too few COs and not enough variation

-- The whole "darker tone" thing they have going. The game is now set in a post-apocalyptic world. That would be fine, I have no problems with it. Except I liked the old one!

All in all, the game is ok, although I miss the COs from AWDS.
