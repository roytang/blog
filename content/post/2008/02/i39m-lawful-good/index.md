She combines a commitment to oppose evil with the discipline to fight relentlessly. She tells the truth, keeps her word, helps those in need, and speaks out against injustice. A lawful good character hates to see the guilty go unpunished. Lawful good is the best alignment you can be because it combines honor and compassion.<br /> </span>

  I've taken online alignment quizzes several times over the years. I've <strong>always </strong>turned out Lawful Good. I'm just not as Chaotic as I think I am.
