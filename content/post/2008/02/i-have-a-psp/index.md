Bought one last week, had not had time to log it until now. It was not so much planned and maybe a bit more of an impulse buy. Something like a cellphone conversation with my brother who's standing in a store in Singapore pressuring me with "Well? Should I buy one or not?" I don't like pressure, so obviously I just said, "Ok, whatever!"

The inevitable question arises: which one is better, PSP or NDS? A friend asked me if they have different types of games, and I tell her that the NDS has more fun/casual games, while the PSP has more action-oriented stuff. So I guess it really depends on your taste.

The NDS is a fun piece of equipment and I had enjoyed it so much I bought a 2nd one when I saw a cheap price, yet lately the PSP has been garnering more attention from me. Two obvious reasons: (a) it's new and (b) **Final Fantasy Tactics**, most likely my favorite game of **all time** is available on the PSP with rewritten dialogue, added characters and added battles. Whether it's better than the NDS in the long run is hard to say, as **Ace Attorney 4 -- Apollo Justice** lies in the short distance.

Also, the presence of **Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max** on the PSP, along with the inevitable need to learn **Tekken: Dark Resurrection** 
so I can beat up the guys at work is a strong incentive to buy a 2nd PSP. But I'm not that rich/impulsive. Not yet.

After the end of the lifetime of the PS2, I had been thinking that I may never again play console-style long games in the vein of **Final Fantasy**, but the PSP can possibly bring me back into that fold. PSX-style games on a handheld is huge, as one of the biggest drawbacks of playing on a console was needing to be stuck in front of a television to play those games. Amusingly, most of the games I have on the PSP now are ports/remakes of Playstation-era (or earlier!) games, which shows my preference for older games. I'm not even aware of what other games are available now -- FF Tactics takes up way too much of my mindspace.

I need to go play some more...
