I had been planning to do this for a while: it's my first WordPress Plugin! Over at [Roy on Magic][1], I often have to write out decklists and such, so I wanted to have an autocard feature similar to the one used at MTGSalvation. After a quick five-minute search I couldn't figure out how they did it, so I just wrote the plugin myself. Actual effort was around 3.5 hours, most of it struggling with PHP and Regular Expressions. :p

Details and download are at [http://www.roytang.net/wiki/index.php/MTG\_Autocard\_WP][2]. Hopefully someone else will find it useful.
