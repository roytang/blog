- 3.2MP or better camera 
- good/easy to use music player 
- at least 2 GB storage more is better 
- prefer easy to use keypad / d-pad (ayaw ko ng may joystick) 
- the larger the display the better (at least 2.4" is preferred - same size display as my last phone) 
- Internet/HTML browsing is a plus - able to view PDFs or office docs easily 
- mura lang. j/k, bahala na ung budget but please don't tell me to get an IPhone, N96 or Xperia X1 unless you're willing to sponsor it :D
