The last limited tournament of the season, it was last week, December 20 at Robinson's Galleria. The format was Shards of Alara sealed deck. For once, I opened a pretty good pool. Unfortunately, I failed to make the follow through. Decklist and (short) tournament report follows.

_(The decklist above only lists 39 cards... not sure what the missing 40th card was )_

The pool was pretty meaty, with lots of removal. Unfortunately, removal doesn't help if you don't draw it. I lost round 2 to an opposing Mycoloth without drawing any of my O-rings. In round 3 I lost in game 3 to mana screw -- I drew a lot of red burn but the mountain didn't come out until I was on my last legs.

Round 1: 2-1 win
  
Round 2: 1-2 loss
  
Round 3: 0-2 loss

I was a bit frustrated due to having a nice pool but bad luck (and admittedly, not so tight plays), so I just dropped after going 1-2. My limited playing has been really bad lately, I hit a GPT top 8 at the very start of the limited season but after that all the GPTs and PTQs I joined I scrubbed out. I think I need to take a break from Magic for a while :p

Will probably resume playing when Conflux comes out (or if there are any good Standard tourneys in January)
