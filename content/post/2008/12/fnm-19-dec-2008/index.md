I'm on vacation, so it means I actually have time to hit FNM. I sleeved up the Kithkin deck (no more Blightning for me!) and headed over to Robinson's Galleria (Getting [robbed along the way][1] fyi). Nothing surprising, I managed to make 3-1, good enough for fourth place and four packs with crap rares inside. My loss was to the mirror match, most probably due to my lower card quality, as I had only 1 planeswalker in my deck.

For reference, the Kithkin decklist I played:

{{< cardlist >}}

{{< cardgroup title="Creatures" >}}
4 Goldmeadow Stalwart
4 Figure of Destiny
3 Burrenton Forge-Tender
4 Wizened Cenn
4 Knight of Meadowgrain
4 Cloudgoat Ranger
2 Ranger of Eos
{{< /cardgroup >}}

{{< cardgroup title="Spells" >}}
4 Spectral Procession
3 Unmake
1 Ajani Goldmane
1 Glorious Anthem
{{< /cardgroup >}}

{{< cardgroup title="Lands" >}}
2 Mutavault
4 Rustic Clachan
4 Windbrisk Heights
16 Plains
{{< /cardgroup >}}

{{< cardgroup title="Sideboard" >}}
3 Wrath of God
3 Stillmoon Cavalier
3 Wispmare
1 Burrenton Forge-Tender
2 Reveillark
2 Oblivion Ring
1 Crib Swap
{{< /cardgroup >}}

{{< /cardlist >}}


I won round 1 vs Kithkin mirror (he drew no Ajanis), round 2 vs Red/Green warriors and round 4 vs Bant control. My sideboard was pretty much weaksauce and never delivered for me. I don't think I need both Wrath and Stillmoon there as I didn't think Stillmoons are necessary in the mirror. The guy I lost to had the right idea -- he boarded in more planeswalkers.
