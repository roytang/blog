I wanted to make a calendar of game release dates in 2009 (so I won't forget), but apparently details are sparse. The only games that I'm remotely interested in that already have release dates are:

20 Jan 2009:

  * Mana Khemia: Student Alliance (PSP)
  * Star Ocean: Second Evolution (PSP)

17 Feb 2009:

  * Dragon Quest V: Hand of the Heavenly Bride (NDS)
  * Street Fighter IV (PS3)

17 Mar 2009: 

  * Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume (NDS)

Unknown Release dates (2009):

  * Dragon Quest IX (NDS)
  * Suikoden Tierkreis (NDS)
  * Fire Emblem Shadow Dragon (First Half 2009) (NDS)
  * GTA: Chinatown Wars (NDS)
  * Puzzle Quest: Galactrix (1Q 2009) (NDS)
  * Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles: Echoes of Time (Spring 2009) (NDS)
  * White Knight Chronicles (PS3)

Pretty slim pickings, but it's probably a blessing in disguise, considering how much backlog I have. The following are games I still want to finish from 2008 or earlier:

  * Jeanne d'Arc (PSP)
  * Final Fantasy: Crisis Core (PSP)
  * Chrono Trigger (NDS) _I'm very close on this one!_
  * Professor Layton and the Curious Village (NDS) _Yes, I'll finish this, hopefully soon!_
  * Disgaea 3 (PS3)
  * Final Fantasy IV (NDS)
  * Dragon Quest IV (NDS)
  * Castlevania: Order of Eclessia (NDS) _Just started playing it last night_
  * The World Ends With You (NDS)
  * Yggdra Union (PSP)

Wishlist for games to be announced in 2009:

  * Remake of [Lufia 2][1]
  * More PS2 remakes on the PSP, specifically [Dragon Quarter][2]
  * US releases for Disgaea 2 (PSP), Tales of Heart (NDS), Tales of Innocence (NDS)
  * More PS3 RPGs
