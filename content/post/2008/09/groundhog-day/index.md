I caught Groundhog Day for the Nth time today on HBO (N roughly around 50). My father claims it's his favorite movie of all time; high praise considering he watches every movie that comes out EVER. I'm not actually going to talk about the movie; it's awesome, if you haven't seen it, you should. You're missing half your life.

If you had one day of eternity, what would you do?

Too bad it's not possible to train to be Batman (your body gets reset every morning); you need to focus on mastering mental disciplines first. Ideally you would have an internet connection available; it should take a few man-years or so to memorize Wikipedia. Probably at some point I would test the limits of what a human being could accomplish in the span of 24 hours. Is it possible to take over the world in 24 hours? Since you get infinite repeats, maybe.

I wonder if a remake of Groundhog Day would sell in this day and age.
