After trying out [usernamecheck.com][1], I decided to try claiming my username "roytang" at various websites. Here's a list of various websites where I have this username.

<http://friendfeed.com/roytang>-- This one actually seems useful.
  
<http://twitter.com/roytang>-- Okay, I admit it. I've actually had this for a few weeks now.
  
<http://pownce.com/roytang/>-- I'm not yet too clear on what it's used for.
  
<http://roytang.posterous.com/>-- would be useful if I didn't already have a blog
  
<http://roytang.livejournal.com/>-- now I can be emo!
  
<http://roytang.pbwiki.com/>-- I created this a long time ago. Recently I had to use pbwiki again so I revived the account.
  
<http://www.last.fm/user/roytang>-- music I listen to.
  
<http://roytang.wordpress.com/>-- As mentioned, I only got this account so I could activate Akismet

There's probably more. Sometimes when I see a random website I try out my username to see if I've registered before and this is successful more often than I expect.

Some "roytang"s on the web that are not me:

http://roytang.blogspot.com -- _obviously _not me

http://www.myspace.com/roytang -- some guy from Singapore
