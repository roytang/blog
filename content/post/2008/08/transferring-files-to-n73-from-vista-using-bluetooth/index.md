I needed to transfer a file to my phone today, but could not find my USB cable. I figured I'd try out the Bluetooth with the laptop.

After around 30 minutes of struggling with the unintuitiveness and some helpful googling I finally was able to transfer my file using the ff steps, for future reference:

1. Turn on Bluetooth on the Acer Aspire using the Bluetooth button.

2. Right-click the Bluetooth icon on the systray -> Show Bluetooth Devices -> Options -> tick "Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer"

3. Enable Bluetooth on the N73 via menu -> Tools -> Bluetooth

4. Scroll right on the N73 and the Paired Device screen is shown. Choose Options -> New Paired Device

5. The N73 should list your computer name (mine is PANDA!), select the computer name and you'll be prompted for a passkey. Don't input anything yet... 

6. Back to the Vista PC, right-click the Bluetooth icon in the systray, then choose Add Device.

7. Tick "My device is set up and ready to be found." and click Next.

8. The wizard should list your phone. Choose the phone and click Next.

9. Tick "Let me choose my own passkey", and type a passkey.

10. You get the message to "Please enter the passkey on your Bluetooth device now", so do just that.

11. The bluetooth connection should be all set up, to send a file to your N73, right-click the bluetooth icon and click Send a file

12. You're done. Hooray!

_Side note: After step 10, Vista seems to want to install drivers for the N73... but it doesn't seem to be necessary_
