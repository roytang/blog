  "text": "Uptake of new technology is pretty much limited by business considerations,\nbut it&#39;s still no excuse to limit expanding developers&#39; horizons.\nUnfortunately the current trend of us moving towards generalization of skills\nover specialization pretty much screws up the progress department - we end up\nwith engineers who have a broad range of outdated unpolished skills than\nengineers with less, but more honed, skills.\n \n \nCoding day-in-day-out also tends to give a false sense of &quot;experience&quot;. As\nI&#39;ve said to Keis a couple of times already, &quot;There&#39;s a difference between 10\nyears of experience and 1 year of experience ten times over&quot;. Even looking at\nmy own code a year ago makes me facepalm at how little effort we spend in\nmaking sure that our &quot;tools&quot;/&quot;saws&quot; are sharp.",
