In case you haven't heard, the internets are in an uproar over [the announced M10 rules changes][1]. A lot of famous Magic people like [Randy Beuhler][2] and [Zvi Mowshowitz][3] have chimed in with their opinions and in general a lot of forum posters are whining about the most controversial change: the removal of combat damage on the stack.

I, for one, welcome our new non-damage stacking overlords. One of Magic's strengths has always been that it is a dynamic, ever-changing game, and this is just another step in its' evolution. Sure, it might turn out to be a wrong step in the end, but while it's here we get to adapt to the new way of thinking, discarding strategic options that are no longer viable (pretty sure [Mogg Fanatic][4] is still a pretty good card though) and looking for what new strategies come to light as a result of the new rules.

A couple of friends from Singapore are in town next week and we're planning to draft some Alara block. Most likely I will try to persuade them to play according to M10 rules, so that we can get a feel of how things play out when blockers need to line up.

Obviously, it's a big change, but it's not as big a change as Sixth Edition was, and Magic survived that just fine. We need to trust that Wizards would not unleash such a major change like this without having tested it and determined that the game of Magic would still be fun. Fun, that's what it's all about, ain't it?
