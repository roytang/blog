No real bombs to speak of (don&#39;t think Archdemon counts, though Knight is close), just a smattering of mana fixing, but I think you can&#39;t ignore the removal in black.  Here&#39;s my low-end list:\n \n1 Carrion Thrash\n1 Court Archers\n1 Fleshbag Marauder\n1 Grixis Grimblade\n1 Jund Battlemage\n2 Jund Hackblade\n1 Jund Sojourners\n1 Marisi&#39;s Twinclaws\n1 Monstrous Carabid\n2 Naya Hushblade\n1 Thunder-Thrash Elder\n1 Topan Ascetic\n1 Toxic Iguanar\n1 Vithian Stinger\n \n1 Absorb Vis\n1 Armillary Sphere\n1 Bituminous Blast\n1 Bone Splinters\n1 Executioner&#39;s Capsule\n1 Exploding Borders\n2 Firewild Borderpost\n1 Gift of the Gargantuan\n1 Sylvan Bounty\n1 Yoke of the Damned\n \n7 Mountain\n3 Forest\n4 Swamp\n \nCritters seem too small to main Fallout, but you can argue to main that against Yoke of the Damned, which hasn&#39;t done much for me.  Having that many blades makes me think you can aggro, but not too sure.",
