Want to post decklists online to tweet to your friends? You can use the [Decklist Sharing Tool][1]!

As an example, here's a recent decklist posted to twitter by [Evan Erwin][2] that I converted using the tool:

I wish I had more decklists to share, but to be honest, I haven't thought much about Zendikar standard yet =p

Update May 2020: The app used to be deployed on Google App Engine, but is no longer available. I've since uploaded the code to Github at https://github.com/roytang/mtg-utils
