Near as I can tell, I started playing MTGO around 2006. This is an archive of MTGO-related social media posts in 2009.

<time>[2009-03-22 10:34] </time> #mtg drafting again. crappy first pack

<time>[23:53]</time> internet crapped out and I lost 2 rounds of draft before I could fix it =/

<time>[2009-08-19 21:27] </time> #mtg couldn't draft due to downtime...decided to randomly play 100-card singleton

<time>[2009-09-13 14:15] </time> #mtg I enjoy winning with Legendary Human Pirates. With Horsemanship.

[14:58] #mtg Wu Longbowman is like a Prodigal Sorcerer that forces you to play poorly.

[16:04] #mtg it's not the first time I had the win on the board and blew it. Pay attention to onboard static effects!

---

<time>[2009-09-14 21:42] </time> #mtg got called a "luckbox" on mtgo. First time I heard that term

---

<time>[2009-09-17 23:49] </time> #mtg oh the pain of turn 1 black vise! I did not miss taking that free damage

<time>[2009-09-20 00:30] </time> #mtg ugh, should not have played 2 events in a row. I literally felt myself go on tilt

<time>[00:59]</time> #mtg What a lucksack! Still won the round despite really bad plays and stupid sideboarding. (Moved out red but kept Sedraxis Spectre?!)

---

<time>[2009-10-27 13:40] </time> Drafts are lagging. My event number is 648214. #mtg

<time>[2009-12-04 08:23] </time> What's the EV for playing in an MtGO Exodus Prerelease? I just want to because older formats are fun :D

---

<time>[2009-12-04 08:35] </time> I wonder if it's a good time to play Standard on MtGO this weekend, all the Americans will be at States!

---

<time>[2009-12-12 22:40] </time> I wish the Exodus queues would fire. People need to play different formats every so often :D #mtgo

#### Momir Basic on MTGO

<time>[2009-12-27 22:28] </time> It looks like I'm skipping sleep tonight to play Momir Basic. Starts at 1am over here!

<time>[2009-12-28 01:38]</time> #momir #mtg Round1: I never played Sundering Titan before, I thought we were both choosing five lands to sacrifice! Doh, shoulda won!

<time>[02:32]</time> #momir #mtg Round2: Just won off opponent's Phage!

<time>[03:35]</time> #momir #mtg Round3: Lost game 1 by pulling Sages of the Anima, game 2 to terrible pulls. gah!

<time>[04:54]</time> #momir #mtg: Round4: Won off 2x Benthic Behemoth. Managed to get around 20 minutes of sleep before that round, I'll sneak in some more

<time>[05:53]</time> #momir #mtg Round5: Won game1 despite opponent having a 60/60 hamletback. Won game2 off my opponent's 3rd turn Countryside Crusher

<time>[07:07]</time> #momir #mtg Final record: 3-3. Momir Basic: You should be thankful when your 7 drops don't kill you as they ETB

<time>[2009-12-29 14:47] </time> #mtg It sucks when you have an awesome sealed pool then lose a round because you didn't draw one of your colors &gt;.&lt;

---

<time>[2009-12-30 09:54] </time> #mtg It's always awesome when you win a game from 1 life due to super-tight play

[15:00] It's also annoying when you lose a match due to missing the tight play =/
