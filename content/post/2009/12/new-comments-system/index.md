I got tired of having to maintain my own comment moderation system, and I decided against throwing out the django code and going back to wordpress. Instead, I'm migrating the comment system to [DISQUS][1].

I love this little mess of django code that's running my blog. I wish I had time to clean it up. But for now, at least I can have a more industrial-strength comment system in place.
