And I guess just a bit more practice?\n \nAlso, Re: &quot;I&#39;m pretty sure giving it flying would make it an invalid target, feel free to correct me if I&#39;m wrong&quot;, I think you&#39;re right, since the card states &quot;deals 3 damage to target creature with/without flying&quot; versus &quot;Target a flying/non-flying creature, and Branching Bolt deals 3 damage to it.&quot;",
