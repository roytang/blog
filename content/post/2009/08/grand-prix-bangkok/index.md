title: Grand Prix Bangkok
---

I spent a few days this weekend in Bangkok playing my first MTG Grand Prix on foreign soil. It was also my first time travelling abroad for non-work purposes (I am not much of a tourist!). Mike and Tinne also attended. I think we stayed in some hotel/hostel with other players from the PH - I shared a room with Nic Ortega. The tournament venue was at The Mall Bangkapi; I remember we had to take a boat ride along an inter-city river to get there and people said the river was stinky!

#### The Trip

<time>[2009-08-20 15:45] </time> flying out to bangkok tonight; ngayon lang ako makakapunta sa ibang time zone!

<time>[2009-08-21 11:53] </time> Arrived safely. Unfortunately, there was no free wifi, either at the hotel or the venue =/ Mahirap magupdate =(

<time>[2009-08-24 13:01] </time> It is your moral responsibility to install Firefox or Chrome on strange internet cafe workstations that only have IE.

<time>[2009-08-24 13:02] </time> Just checked out of the hotel, flight back is at midnight tonight.

<time id="3509583030">[2009-08-24 17:14] </time> Couldn't sleep very well last night so I still feel tired. Still eight hours before the flight =/

#### The Grand Prix

The tournament format was M10 Sealed. I had [won my 3 byes earlier that month](/2009/08/gpt-bangkok-4-1st/). After scrubbing out on Day 1, I also played a Standard PTQ on Day 2, where I also scrubbed out!

This was a photo from coverage of a feature match with me watching in the background. (Presumably because I had already scrubbed out!)

<time>[2009-08-24 13:02] </time> #mtg #gpbangkok Yes, I performed poorly. Overall record was 3-8 including side events. =/

[16:44] #mtg #gpbangkok Correction: My weekend record was 4-9. 7-9 with byes. Will do better next time!
