Cancel and Negate were pretty good for me in the actual games. Since my opponent turned out to have ground stall guys (Wall of Frost, etc) also, Magebane Armor would have been pretty bad. Whisperslik Cloak is by far the best of those 3 equipment, since a cloak on a baneslayer angel is basically game.Thanks for the comment!", "date": "2009-08-04 08:10:45", "photo": ""}
