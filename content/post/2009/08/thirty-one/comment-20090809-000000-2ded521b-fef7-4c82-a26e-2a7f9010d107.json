I for one was scared as hell to quit Azeus and go for an MBA.  I was even resentful that I&#x27;m graduating during this hard times, where I could have comfortably passed through the recession playing Magic with you guys.  I&#x27;m still scared as hell to what the future might bring, but I don&#x27;t regret my decision to leave and get that MBA.  I know its not my dream, but I know its the start of my dream.  You either do or you don&#x27;t.",
