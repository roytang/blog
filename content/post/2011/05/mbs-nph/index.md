Combining these sets into a single set recap because I didn't play a lot of either set. Actually just skipped the MBS prerelease altogether, the first in a long while.

### New Phyrexia Prerelease

The NPH prerelease we attended was on May 07 @ Eton Cyberpod. Notes below were recovered from my journal.

I taxied over to the McDonald's on Katipunan by 9:30am (way early ~~) to meet up with Alex and head over to Eton Cyberpod Corinthian to play in the NG prerelease. As I would discuss with a friend of mine later, Prereleases are basically terrible in terms of EV, since the cost is way more than just buying the six boosters for sealed; and buying six boosters doesn't even have a very high EV to begin with. Alex and I had tickets so we sped to the head of the line and started in flight B. Seems to be a lot less people in the NPH prerelease compared to earlier prereleases, could it be due to the early leaks of the set?!? I suppose wizards might comment on that later. We got handed our sealed pools to register and the one I was listing was pretty bad and I kinda apologized to the guy I passed it to that the pool was pretty bad. Then I was passed my pool (the guy who was registering it was actually the last to finish at our table and I had to wait a bit), and it too was pretty bad. No cash cards at all, and the power level of the cards was pretty weak. No choice but to work hard, eh?

I built a B/G poison deck, though I had some other alternatives like U or W with fliers and such, I felt like with the low power level of my cards overall I should just go with poison to give me a chance of blowouts. And sneaking in wins with Untamed Might. (That happened a few times). I don't think I need to make a blow-by-blow of every game and round, but I do know I did manage to win by poison every single time. I won rounds 1 and 2 handily, the guys were kinda new to tournaments. Round 3 put up a bit of a fight as it was kinda of a B/G mirror, though I had more infect than he did. After round 3, both Alex and I were 3-0 and as I was playing some practice matches with Nick Ortega I joked that there was a good chance (we later determined it to be 20%) that Alex and I would be paired against each other. And of course we were. While we were playing Ritchie showed up and watch us fight each other. I had some good fun with Alex by giving him an offensive GG (basically I told the judge who was sitting beside us on our second game that he could already write down that I won 2-0). As Karma for my offensive GG, my rares in the prize packs were terrible >.<. I gave the shirt to Alex as there was only one size (and I doubt it would have fit me anyway)

Side note: Kinda glad I got 4-0 in the PR, I don't think I've done this in a while. At least I still know how to play Magic ~
