<time>[2011-01-15 17:01] </time> Playing in ME4 sealed release event. OMG Oasis doesn't produce mana!

<time>[2011-10-01 18:01] </time> Had an extra M11 pack on MTGO, bots were only buying it for only 1 ticket so I just went ahead and opened it, got a Frost Titan #smallthings

<time>[22:28]</time> I dreamt that Inkmoth Nexus was reprinted in Innistrad. Dream me was not a very good set designer

<time>[22:33]</time> I still have a Scars draft set online. Time for a late night draft~

<time>[22:54]</time> During drafting, I wish there was a little indicator near each card that told me how many of it I already have

<time>[2011-10-15 11:46] </time> Wondering if I should play the horribly low EV MTGO prerelease events. Are the servers fine today?

---

<time>[2011-10-16 22:20] </time> I opened a Snapcaster in my pool earlier today on MTGO and sold it for 20tix; people are now buying at 16tix, 20% drop in a few hours

<time>[2011-10-16 22:38] </time> MTGO PTQs get more participants than Australian GPs. Just sayin'

---

<time>[2011-10-21 05:31] </time> What is a good mtgo bot to get commons/uncommons from?

---

<time>[2011-10-22 07:20] </time> My first innistrad draft: https://i.imgur.com/wKYc5.jpg

<time>[07:55]</time> Sigh, I often lose to poor keeps
