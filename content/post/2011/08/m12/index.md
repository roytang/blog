### Preview Season

<time>[2011-05-23 21:34] </time> The haste reminder text on Chandra's Phoenix makes me expect some new guy to hit me with bolt, reanimate phoenix then attack all at EOT

<time>[21:38]</time> Also I hope Chandra's Phoenix gives rise to a whole new generation of red decks capable of stronger comebacks

<time>[2011-06-17 14:26] </time> Does damage stay on PWs until eot? If gideon has 8 counters and activates 3rd ability then i bolt him twice in response, will he die?

<time>[2011-06-22 12:55] </time> Holy crap, bolt and incinerate, together again! #itsbeensolong

<time>[2011-06-26 10:35] </time> I'm sure I'm not the only one secretly hoping the Ravnica shocklands are in M12

### Prerelease

Jul 9 @ [Eton Cyberpod Mall](/locations/eton_cyberpod)

<time>[2011-07-09 17:32] </time> Went 3-1 at the #M12 prerelease. My strategy revolved around falling behind then hoping for Gideon to come and save my sorry ass

[17:37] Oh and our local prereleases apparently no longer have land stations or t-shirt prizes for those going 4-0 :(
