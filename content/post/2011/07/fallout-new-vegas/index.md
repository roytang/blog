<time>[2011-03-24 13:28] </time> Posted on r/gaming: [Fallout New Vegas: Is it still buggy/glitchy?](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/gaaau/fallout_new_vegas_is_it_still_buggyglitchy/)

> I didn't bother purchasing it before because of all the reported bugs, etc. Hs it gotten better?

<time>[2011-07-05 07:30] </time> Steam's summer sale finally made me spend money. Yay for cheap Fallout NV :D

<time>[2011-07-16 23:13] </time> I guess I'll restart Fallout: New Vegas in hardcore mode. Life is too short for two playthroughs!

<time>[2011-07-30 17:06] </time> Finished Fallout: New Vegas ~ Still a lot to do in the Mojave though

<time>[2011-08-15 00:21] </time> Posted on r/gaming: [Fallout: New Vegas mods and savegames question](https://reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/jiizi/fallout_new_vegas_mods_and_savegames_question/)

> If I install a mod and save my game with the mod enabled, then I later disable or uninstall it, will my save game no longer work?

<time>[2011-11-25 07:29] </time> Yay, Fallout:NV DLC on 75% daily deal today (really the only thing I wanted to get for this Steam sale, but we shall see lol)

<time>[2012-08-21 22:12] </time> The final boss in Fallout New Vegas The Lonesome Road was Bane from TDKR!

<time>[2012-08-23 07:12] </time> Fallout New Vegas The Lonesome Road: Something tells me there's a Futurama fan over at Obsidian
