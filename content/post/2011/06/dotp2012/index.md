title: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 (Steam)
---

Played a bunch of Duels 2012 - it's fun, and there's still the Archenemy and Revenge campaigns to play, but it feels like there are a lot less decks and options compared to Duels 2011. Might be because I already have two of the expansion packs for Duels 2011.

<time>[2011-06-10 08:03] </time> Duels 2012 is almost out, and I haven't even finished Duels 2011 yet!

<time>[2011-06-15 00:07] </time> I thought Duels 2012 would be out June 15th. Guess I need to be patient and wait one more day

<time>[2011-06-15 23:32] </time> Anyone here got DotP 2012 on Steam? Hit me up: My steam id is hungryroy

<time>[2011-06-16 00:18] </time> The Duels 2012 unlock on Steam seems to be delayed to 2AM, I guess I'll just install it in the morning. Meanwhile:

<time>[2011-06-25 18:01] </time> Okay, archenemy in Duels 2012 is way more fun than I expected

<time>[2011-06-27 00:11] </time> I have to say I'm impressed with how the AI handles combat tricks. #Duels2012

<time>[2011-09-18 12:56] </time> For the price of an MTGO draft, I could have Duels 2012 + expansion on Steam. Both offer limited card sets, but one provides unlimited play.

<time>[13:07]</time> I also like how they just name the Duels DLCs as "Expansion".  Apparently naming is hard.
