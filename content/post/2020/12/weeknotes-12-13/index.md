Time passes yet again. I think I have to get used to not having much personal stuff to report in the weeknotes on certain weeks (aside from the watching/gaming parts), especially given the pandemic where I'm at home 90% of the time.

Speaking of the pandemic, the UK started vaccinations last week, and the US FDA approved the Pfizer vaccine as well, so hopefully this is where things start to turn around. Sadly, it may be a while before vaccinations get widespread, especially here in the Philippines. I'm hoping things clear up by mid next year for us here, but I'm not optimistic about it. It would be really sad if the pandemic restrictions reach next year's holiday season.

Not that people here seem to realize there's still a pandemic going on, if pictures coming out of Divisoria are any indication. I get that not everyone has access to online shopping, but are there no other options for holiday gift shopping than walking through such dense crowds? This may be one instance where our generous gift-giving culture is bad for us, since people are still out trying to buy gifts when the pandemic is a perfectly good excuse for scaling back on the shopping. Capitalism ho!

The saddest part of this pandemic for me has that my brothers and their families can't come over to visit, which means my parents don't get to see their grandkids (and I don't get to see the pamangkins). Sometimes we push back a bit on that envelope, but it'll be a while before we all really get to see each other and enjoy company in person.

**Gaming**: 

- I managed to finish Batman Arkham Knight! The main story at least. Achievement completion seems unlikely, given the multiplayer achievements, and even some of the single-player ones seem a bit too challenging. I was able to enjoy the game despite the graphical issues I encountered early on. Lowering the settings helped a lot I think, though things still weren't 100% good. I really take to these style of games where there's an open world and you have a lot of things to collect and such.
- I ordered Fire Emblem Fates for the Switch yesterday! I was also considering Paper Mario Origami King, but that had some mixed reviews, so holding off for now.

**Watching Lately:** Currently doing a binge re-watch of The Big Bang Theory as my background watching, I'm up to season 7 at the moment. I think the show holds up better than some of its contemporaries such as How I Met Your Mother. I know the geek portrayals can be a bit exaggerated or patronizing, so a lot of geeks don't like it, but for me it's fine. I'm thinking of doing a bad comic book movie marathon sometime this month, covering the ones I didn't bother watching, stuff like Ben Affleck Daredevil, Michael B Jordan Fantastic Four, and the recently released New Mutants. We'll see if I get around to it.

Just under two weeks until Christmas!
