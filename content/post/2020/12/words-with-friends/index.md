title: Words With Friends
---

Words with Friends was a Scrabble variant played via a mobile game/app. I played it a lot from around 2011-2020. Towards the end of the period, the only remaining opponent I had was my mom. I just stopped playing shortly after 2020, just running out of momentum. Maybe I'll get back to it someday.

[@WordsWFriends](https://twitter.com/WordsWFriends/) :( Not everyone can take a turn everyday! Busy people can make words with friends too!

<time>[2016-11-12 22:12] </time> IDK how to react when people proudly post "nerdy" pictures of themselves playing scrabble and their board shows they're total amateurs #wut

<time>[22:13]</time> I'm totally losing all my current games of Words With Friends though, so maybe I'm not one to judge other people's scrabble games

<time>[2016-12-30 13:13] </time> When you just want to win your last [@WordsWFriends](https://twitter.com/WordsWFriends/) game of the year but 2016 isnt having any of it #fb

<time>[2017-05-10 23:51] </time> In words with friends i always play bingos even if it leads to my doom. There's a lesson to be learned here if only i knew what

<time>[2018-02-07 09:10] </time> I just executed the most well-planned-in-advance final move to come back from an 80 pt deficit in [@WordsWFriends](https://twitter.com/WordsWFriends/) and im just here silently cackling in glee to myself

<time>[2018-04-04 00:25] </time> A stranger with whom I was playing Words with Friends  messaged me to ask if I was a bot @_@

<time>[2018-05-23 00:49] </time> Itâ€™s weird when during the last few turns of scrabble/words with friends and when the point spread is so large that I already know if Iâ€™m going to win or lose, I still get stuck looking for the optimal play. I know why I do it but I should be chill about it more often lol

<time>[2018-06-24 09:30] </time> Dear [@WordsWFriends](https://twitter.com/WordsWFriends/) can I turn off your loot boxes? Iâ€™m never going to use them! Iâ€™m even at maximum coins!

<time>[2018-07-29 18:24] </time> Itâ€™s beautiful. Yet I must destroy it. [@WordsWFriends](https://twitter.com/WordsWFriends/)

<time>[2019-08-12 17:25] </time> dear [@WordsWFriends](https://twitter.com/WordsWFriends/) please give me the option to disable all of these little events and gimmicks your app has. I dont care for them and they only slow down the app, i just want to play
