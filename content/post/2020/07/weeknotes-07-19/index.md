My country:

- There are days when I have to consciously temper my rage at the shenanigans of this government. I can't write about them today.

My stuff:

- [This week's pandemic notes](/2020/07/covid19-07-19/).
- Had a busy work week again; at the same time I also picked up an older charity project where the client asked for UI updates. Had issues with running the old code, and it was small enough, so I decided to rewrite it in a new tech stack. Might write about it at some point.
- Gaming:
    - I am like 98% through the FF7R hard mode run. I'm totally making these percentages up, but I do have only one trophy left, and it's this annoying minigame.
    - I started trying out some of the new leaders/civs in the Civ6 New Frontier pack. Another drop should be coming this week, so looking forward to that!
    - MTG JumpStart is out this week! I tried it a couple of times on Arena. Some combinations are much better than others; the sad things is if you picked a miserable pair you have to stick with it longer before you can get your requisite two wins. Here's an (ongoing) [thread of my JumpStart results](/2020/07/1283901490206109698/) will probably update it through the month it's available.
- Quiz: 
    - Didn't win any online quiz this week, boo.
- Watching lately:
    - After watching Atomic Blonde last week, I watched the Old Guard for back-to-back Charlize Theron action flicks. Pretty fun, although some plot points might make you go what?
    - There's a bunch of stuff coming out in July that I might watch: new season of Umbrella Academy, and there's a Transformers anime coming out on NF, and well, there's also a long backlog of things to watch...
- Side projects: 
    - Nothing to note, too busy.
