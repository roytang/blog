The world:

- hm. I was a bit busy this week, so I wasn't paying too much attention, so I don't have too much to rail against today. Well of course, things are still ongoing. There's still the pandemic, fascist police state philosophy continues to rear it's ugly head in the US, PH gov't continues to be dumb, etc., but this week seemed a bit tame comparably.

My stuff:

- Busy with rebuilding the UI for the old project. I'm having fun with it, so that's something. I think this week went by more quickly for me because of it.
- Gaming:
  - Final Fantasy VII Remake completed! Review [here](/2020/07/ff7r-review/).
  - I played through a couple of Civ6 games, trying out the new civs and game modes from the New Frontier pass. Fun and challenging. Apocalypse mode: it's an insane feeling the first time you see a comet strike take out a city. I was actually streaming the gameplay to a friend on Discord when this happened and we both went "Woah!" and he said that pushed him to get the DLC as well. Secret societies: Only tried Voidsingers so far; their cultists are great for culture victory since they're a constant source of relics for tourism, and the Old God Monument gives you GW slots for them.
  - MTG: Still playing a bunch of JumpStart, but also put together Bant Ramp for Historic. Currently at Diamond 4, I'll see if I can grind Mythic for constructed before end of month. Related: I watched Maro's Comic-con stream for Zendikar Rising last night, but left kinda underwhelmed. Set boosters are neat, but I kind of wanted more info/spoilers about the set itself. It's hard to be excited about the set boosters when my MTG involvement is primarily through Arena these days.
- Quiz: 
  - Only played 2 online quizzes this week (the third one didn't fire due to not enough participants). There was a fun Scientists/Inventors round which I could have perfected if I had gone with my gut answer (Rutherford) and not listened to my teammates lol.
- Watching lately:
  - There's a new season of Family Guy on Netflix, so I've started to watch that in the background while I'm working on other things
  - I watched a [for-charity cast-reunion live-table-read for Scott Pilgrim vs the World](https://ew.com/events/comic-con/scott-pilgrim-cast-reunion-table-read/) last week. I enjoyed it so much, I went and rewatched the movie on Netflix as well.
- Side projects: 
  - Technically, this old project I'm revamping used to be a "side project".
