First week of May. At least two more weeks of quarantine remain. [COVID19 Diary](/2020/03/covid19/) still exists, only updated every so often. I stayed in the entire week!

The week was slightly more productive than the last one, at least in terms of personal projects. I moved a couple of them forward. And also spent a bunch of time spring cleaning and moving stuff around here on the site. Details to follow.

Quizzes: I watched the Geekfight, but I could only personally answer like 4 questions maybe. My teammate who was an official player did much better. We joined the PopQuiz one, but got a cursed ace and finished low. Looking forward to next week's quizzes, and there may even be a new organizer setting up an online quiz!

### Watching lately

I burned through the remaining 5 seasons of Psych and the 2017 Psych movie as well. Overall it's a really fun series, despite usually sticking to a formula. Chock-full of pop culture references and shout-outs and in-jokes and such, just the kind of thing I enjoy.

The only other thing I've watched this week was the Parks and Recreation reunion special (quarantine edition), fun episode and happy to see these guys all together again.

At least I can watch other things now!

I kind of want to be filling out a "things of interest" section in these weeknotes every week, basically collecting interesting things I found on the internet during the week. I do find/read a bunch of interesting things over the week, but the problem is I seldom log them down for future posting. Will need to correct moving forward.

### Gaming

Ikoria drafting is done for me, for now at least. You can view all my Ikoria drafts at the [MTGIKO tag](/tags/mtgiko).

My FF7 Remake Deluxe Edition copy [got delivered last Friday](/2020/05/ff7r/)! I briefly considered asking my brother to drive over and bring my PS4 home, but that isn't really essential travel so I thought better of it. Cloud and company will have to wait. I'm not in a hurry, and really, there's a bunch of other games to play.

[Humble Choice for May](https://www.humblebundle.com/subscription/may-2020) is out, but not too happy with the choices. I already have X-Com II, and it doesn't even come with the War of the Chosen DLC! Probably passing on this one.

Other things: Trivia team set up a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCptXvNbp4ETVttb_k-1oOww). I suspect the videos will be more gaming-related than trivia-related though.

Site updates: 

- cleanups of old content (mostly stuff that got mangled during import from Wordpress or elsewhere)
- together with the pass over the old content, I've been putting together some "media diet" pages. I've seen this in a few other blogs, where they track all their media (TV/movies/books) consumption. I'm already doing this more often with the [Watching lately posts](/blog/tags/watching-lately) (and in the weeknotes), and my [2020 movies list](/lists/2020/movies), but I wanted it to include other media types too (including games), so I started putting together the lists. For the older years, I have to reconstruct the media list from old blog posts and so on, so they're bound to be incomplete and probably inaccurate, but it is what it is. I started from 2002 and working my way back to the present. It's still WIP, but the list should be [here](/media/).
- adding some other new stuff/sections, but nothing linked publicly yet. Need to arrange everything correctly, may take a while.
