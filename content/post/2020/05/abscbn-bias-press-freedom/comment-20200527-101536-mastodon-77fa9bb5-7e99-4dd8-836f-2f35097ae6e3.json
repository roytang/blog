But you can&#39;t report everything (physically impossible), so the choice of what facts to present is already in itself is an editorial decision. In many cases, even the facts will be &quot;biased&quot; to some. For example Twitter tried to add a link to facts about mail-in balloting to Trump&#39;s tweets and he claims that&#39;s &quot;biased&quot;. One can try to be unbiased as much as possible, but you often can&#39;t avoid your own experiences affecting your tone, delivery, etc</p>",
