The world continues to be terrible. The PH government wants people to get back to work and everything to spur the economy (with health precautions and everything). A lot of people have no choice, but I'm fortunate enough to not have to go out there yet, and I'm sure people like me will still hold back. This all would have been a lot easier if the government had gotten control of this pandemic early on but it is what it is.

Still not writing blog posts apparently. I have a lot of thoughts swirling in my head, I'm sure they'll pop out sooner or later.

Gaming: Hey, I [finished Super Mario Sunshine](/2020/10/1314224120490389504/)! I started Super Mario Galaxy right afterwards. It's actually interesting playing through these 3d Mario games for the first time, since I can see how things evolve. Will hopefully have some good thoughts for the eventual review, probably after I also play Odyssey.

Still ongoing: [the Inktober thing](/tags/inktober2020).

Still ongoing: The site rewrite project. It's going reasonably well, and might be ready soonish (famous last words), so I started looking into the new server as well. I've also mentioned before that I've been planning to [migrate to a new webhost because GoDaddy etc.](/2019/03/rip-webfaction/), and I had been leaning towards getting a VPS on Linode so I tried to do that this week, but for some reason they kept rejecting my application, so I just went with DigitalOcean instead. They give free two months $100 credit, so I'm not paying for anything until December or such, so that's nice. I spent a couple of hours wrangling with Nginx + uWSGI + my app on Ubuntu, with permission problems and everything. I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually!

Some recent fun things on the internet:

- [Twitter thread about free indie games](https://twitter.com/Toadsanime/status/1312880060899233797). Not like I have time to play all of these, but I find it fun to browse these lists and fantasize about my lifelong dream of being an indie game developer that I still hope to eventually get back to someday (why not today)? Anyway, check them out.
- [100 Sequences that shaped animations](https://www.vulture.com/article/most-influential-best-scenes-animation-history.html). Some fun history of animation stuff to go through.
- [Why do mirrors flip horizontally but not vertically?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBpxhfBlVLU)(Youtube video). I always have trouble explaining this, so this one was nice to watch.
- [Sony released a PS5 teardown video](https://blog.playstation.com/2020/10/07/ps5-teardown-an-inside-look-at-our-most-transformative-console-yet/). My biggest takeaway from this is that this console is HUGE.
