  "text": "I failed to add the word \u201cindefinitely\u201d... there\u2019s no need to quit Facebook if you\u2019re just fed up, as it has its uses, and you\u2019ve invested in your contacts after all this while.  It\u2019s just useful to think of FB as a way to keep in touch, and to go on it once in a while. If you find that you go on it for the likes, or that an inordinate amount of time is spent on FB then go ahead.  Like anything, FB can become toxic... so siguro bala-balanse lang. Especially in this time of Covid, it\u2019s good to keep in touch with everybody.",
