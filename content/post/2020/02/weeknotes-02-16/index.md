The world's crises continue to settle in, but at least we have no new entries. The coronavirus continues to spread, will probably be a while before it tapers off. Our dear president, in his finite wisdom, has decided to withdraw from the US-PH visiting forces agreement. I'm sure our Chinese masters approve. 

The Oscars were held last week. Didn't watch or anything, but happy for the Parasite win, about time for a foreign language best picture. 

The world needs us to be better.

We went to a QC quiz night last Wednesday. To get to the venue, I found myself walking through the old neighborhood again, the one where I grew up. It's been a while since [the last time](/2013/02/unscheduled-trip-down-memory-lane/). Unlike last time where I only had a quick unscheduled glance, this time I went out of my way to walk down a few streets in the area, since I had the time. 

The streets I walked were narrower and shorter than I remember - I guess in my head I still see them through a ten-year-old's eyes. I recognize many of the houses I walk past, neighbors we never really knew. But I recognized their plants! One house still had a lot of greenery adorning their facade, same as I remember it. In the last post I wrote that our old lot had been replaced by three townhouses, but this time when I passed by I saw there were four identical ones side-by-side, and I couldn't tell which three replaced my grandmother's house. Was the fourth one added later, or did I simply miss it the last time I was here? 

There was also a KFC now along Anonas, to my left as I emerged from our old street. That used to be some kind of car repair complex, I think? Memories are hazy. I think to myself: "there should be a Google Maps version of the Wayback Machine, showing us what the streets looked like some time ago, for nostalgia's sake." I continue walking and take a break at a 7-11 across the street from [the old bakery](/2020/02/1228281070300299264/). 

(As for the quiz, we won handily, though I suggested that dominating so much might discourage future quizzes in the same area. Eh, whatever.)

[Three movies watched this week](/lists/2020/movies/), all of them very good. Aside from that, I've also been rewatching all of Rick and Morty. It's a fun rewatch, but I'm mostly doing it because it's a topic for a quiz next week, and it can be a very challenging show for that purpose, because most episodes are filled wall-to-wall with zany antics, it's hard to tell what needs to be remembered. 

I finished **Tales of Berseria** [last Friday](/2020/02/1228114501179977730/)! Well, the main story at least. I plan to still go for the platinum, though that'll probably take quite a bit longer. So the blog post/review will have to wait a bit. I feel like I'm already way over the typical hours for the first run though.

I had one of my regular checkups this week. Bloodwork all came back good, but the annoying thing was mild coughs/cold I was experiencing since the start of the week. Probably exacerbated by the cold nights. Now is not a good time to be remotely Chinese looking and coughing/sneezing in public! My doctor prescribed a bunch of things, including some nasal spray and a pill I have to dissolve in a glass of water. Hopefully they help; the cold seems to have receded by now, but I still have the coughs.

Site changes this week:

- not much in terms of blog posts last week. I did have some things in mind, just not the time or energy to sit down and fire one out
- did some work on the import backend for tweets, pockets links, etc. Mostly a revamp needed for future enhancements that I want. Fixed some bugs. Imported links from pocket are automatically shared to Mastodon now.
- started work on the planned redesign. Lots of things to think about re: layouts and I'll probably be trying out some CSS things. Referencing a number of blogs whose layout I like. I don't wanna rush it, so it may take a while. I previously said it would be limited to the home page, but looks like scope is creeping up!

This week I'm looking forward to:

- I have some actual work lined up. Not much, just some planning and estimation stuff. Not that I'm looking forward to it, but might be good as a change of pace.
- we might be doing two quiz nights next week.
- there's also some family birthdays, etc.
- site: continue the redesign things
- side project: work on some QoL improvements
- still haven't watched Birds of Prey
