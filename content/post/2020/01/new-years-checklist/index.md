title: New Year's Checklist 2020
type: post
---

It's a new year! I don't have any clever jokes or deep wisdom or long, introspective essays to share at this time (I have those the rest of the year though!). Instead, here's a checklist for the new year. 

In no particular order:

  * Greet your loved ones and friends and anyone else you hold dear. Maybe even those you disagree with
  * Ponder why people give so much significance to the transition between an arbitrarily-chosen pair of 24 hour periods
  * Take stock and reflect on the past year
  * Think about what you'd like to learn this year or how you want to improve
  * Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful
  * Change your passwords
  * Buy a new toothbrush
  * Set a target of how many books you'll read in 2020
  * Choose the first book to read
  * Throw away a few things you no longer need
  * Make a list of where you will travel to in 2020
  * Check out what movies are coming out this year and which ones you want to watch (see below)
  * Audit your financials -- where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc
  * Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that's gathered there over the past year
  * Make a list of projects you want to do in 2020
  * Choose something from the past year that you're going to stop watching or doing
  * Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great.
  * Get rid of 2019 calendars
  * Make a list for the new year!
  * Clean up the photos on your phone, tablet and computer
  * Delete all files downloaded 2018 or earlier
  * Follow up on the people who owe you money or things
  * Review your recurring luxury costs (Netflix, etc) and evaluate whether you still really need them
  * Export your FB, Instagram and Twitter data
