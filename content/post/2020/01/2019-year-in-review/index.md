title: 2019 Year in Review
---

Well, it has certainly been another revolution around the sun. I added the tag [yearnotes](/tags/yearnotes) for these end-of-year recap and statistic things.

2019 Statistics:

Work, Travel, Learning and Self Improvement:

  * Hours worked: 180-200 hours (estimated) - down from 1163 hours last year
    * I've been cutting back on my work commitments this year, preferring to spend more time on personal projects.
  * Programming languages/frameworks learned: Only 1 really new thing, that's the Ionic mobile app framework. (Down from 4 last year). Some other stuff though:
    * I did do a [miniproject](/2019/08/devnotes-miniproject-tt/) which let me try out a few new things.
    * I also explored a bit and learned a lot about web standards and [Indieweb things](/2019/11/indieweb/) this year
  * Books read: 4, same as last year. 
    * [So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport](/2019/11/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/)
    * [Utopia for Realists by Rutger Bergman](/2019/08/utopia-for-realists/)
    * [Wheel of Time: New Spring by Robert Jorden](/2019/05/wheel-of-time-new-spring/)
    * [Wheel of Time: Eye of the World by Robert Jorden](/2019/05/wheel-of-time-eye-of-the-world/) (Reread)
    * Action item: read more books
  * Duolingo streak: 355 days. I believe this is my longest streak ever since i started using Duolingo last 2015. (Whether I'm actually getting good enough at Spanish or Japanese is another matter)
  * Other countries visited: 1, 2 if you count the layover in South Korea. This year's [US trip](/tags/ustrip2019/) was totally unplanned, and cost like 30% of the year's expenses!
  * I also took a trip to Daet for the first time in 15 years!

Writing and Social media:

  * Facebook status updates: 315 (1081 last year). Operation: Reduce Facebook Usage is proceeding smoothly.
  * Tweets: 1124 (down from 1550 last year)
  * [Instagram](/source/instagram) photos: 108. Up from 21 last year, mostly due to travel and doing [inktober](/tags/inktober) this year.
  * Answers written on Quora: 0.
  * 0 words written forÂ [Nanowrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/)
  * 35 sketches submitted to [r/sketchdaily](https://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily)
  * 224 blog posts, 119529 words worth; up from 105 posts and 62888 words last year. A record for this blog's lifetime. It may be a bit above the volume I want though. 
  * Full stats for content on this blog and social media activity available [here](/about/stats/).

  * MTG paper tournament games win rate: 39% (See [my MTG stats](/about/stats/mtg))

  * Average points per turn in Words with Friends: 26, same as last year

Others:

  * Fitbit activity: 1,766,878 steps, 1,378.15 km walked. Down from 1,820,053 steps, 1,419.64 km last year. Roughly a 3% drop. I've been a lot lazier about walking, especially when the weather is too hot or rainy, which happens quite often. Need to find a way to get around this.
  * Donuts eaten: 1.5, down from 4 last year. This is a ridiculous statistic to track, but I suppose the downtrend is good.

  * Weddings attended: 2 (up 2)
  * Wakes attended: 1 :(
  * Things watched on Netflix: 416 (789 last year)
  * Quiz nights attended: 27 (winning 3 times) - waaay up from 8 last year.
  * Grab trips: 46 (down 55 from last year!))
  * Times I won the lotto: 0 (I kind of regret putting this number two years ago, as now I can't remove it without looking suspicious)
  * Bears defeated in single combat: 0
