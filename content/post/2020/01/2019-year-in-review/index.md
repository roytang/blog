Well, it has certainly been another revolution around the sun. I added the tag [yearnotes](/tags/yearnotes) for these end-of-year recap and statistic things.

2019 Statistics:

Work, Learning and Self Improvement:

  * Hours worked: 180 hours (estimated) - down from 1163 hours last year
    * I've been cutting back on my work commitments this year, preferring to spend more time on personal projects.
  * Programming languages/frameworks learned: Only 1 really new thing, that's the Ionic mobile app framework. (Down from 4 last year). Some other stuff though:
    * I did do a [miniproject](/2019/08/devnotes-tt-miniproject/) which let me try out a few new things.
    * I also explored a bit and learned a lot about web standards and [Indieweb things](/2019/11/indieweb/) this year
  * Books read: 4, same as last year. 
    * [So Good They Can't Ignore You by Cal Newport](/2019/11/so-good-they-cant-ignore-you/)
    * [Utopia for Realists by Rutger Bergman](/2019/08/book-review-utopia-for-realists-by-rutger-bregman/)

    * Action item: read more books
  * Duolingo streak: 354 days (as of 27/Dec). I believe this is my longest streak ever since i started using Duolingo last 2015. (Whether I'm actually getting good enough at Spanish or Japanese is another matter)
