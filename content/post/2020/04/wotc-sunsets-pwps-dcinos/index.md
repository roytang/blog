title: WotC sunsets PWPs and DCI numbers
---

It's the end of an era: Wizards is sunsetting PWPs and DCI numbers https://www.wizards.com/Magic/PlaneswalkerPoints/36918016

I had exported my own PWP data and DCI match history already, but posting here for posterity:

If you're looking to export your own data for any reason, I found this script: https://github.com/giventofly/exportpwp/blob/master/README.md from https://www.reddit.com/user/heyzeto/ to export everything to a CSV, I tried it and it's pretty good! (I can't recommend my own code, it's super messy!)

More of my own data, lifetime ranking: 230th in the PH isn't so bad, given how inconsistently I'd played through the years. (I tried to get my worldwide ranking too, but the site kept coughing up errors, too many people searching for their own data after the announcement?)
