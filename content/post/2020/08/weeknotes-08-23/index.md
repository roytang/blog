The week after I posted about phoning in the weeknotes, here I am with one where there's nothing much to report. Not that surprising, given how busy I was over the previous few weeks, I took the opportunity to take a more relaxing week.

There was a bit of work to be done, but very miniscule by comparison. Minor fixes here and there, including to some side projects.

I did get to write on the blog more, as expected. Let's hope I can keep it up.

These week's quiz nights were terrible for our team, but on the bright side, I got to [do a couple of sketches](/2020/08/quiz-night-sketches/).

Here are the things I've been watching and playing the past week:

- Continued drafting Amonkhet Remastered, although the last few drafts went a bit poorly. The [mtgakr tag](/tags/mtgakr/) on this site has all the records.
- After finishing D:OS2 and FF7R, I looked around for a new game to start and decided on Uncharted 4, which I guess I got free from Plus or something. I haven't gotten very far yet, but unsurprisingly Nathan Drake's antics still really challenge one's suspension of disbelief. He has to be one of the most peak-performance athletes in the world to consistently pull of the jumping and wall climbing stunts he regularly does. Not to mention being able to win over basically hordes of heavily-armed mercenaries in gunfights. Not that it's not fun and engaging as a game, it just feels so ridiculous.
- [DC Fandome](https://www.dcfandome.com) was today, I watched some panels and new trailers and such. I enjoyed the Suicide Squad reveals and the Wonder Woman 1984, Shazam 2 and Justice League Snyder cut trailers, plus previews for the new Gotham Knights and Suicide Squad games, looking forward to those. (I should probably get around to Arkham Origins first.)
- Continuing to play SC2 coop and Blood Rage with the regular groups

Not that there's anything wrong with a bit of relaxing downtime, but I am hoping to eventually ramp up to being more productive in the coming weeks, especially with the side projects.
