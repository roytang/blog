### Limited Notes

- No Quick Drafts here, so I would guess this was the last set before QDs were introduced. I tried the rare Traditional (BO3) draft here, which ended terribly.
- Most played archetype was WU Party, but apparently not the winningest one!
- This set also had a promo where you can collect full-art Zendikar lands for each draft you participated in

### 7-x Drafts
