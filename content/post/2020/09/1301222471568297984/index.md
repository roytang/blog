Just finished Disco Elysium. This game is fantastic

From the journal:

> I started and finished Disco Elysium during the first half of the week. Fantastic game, and I was probably unhealthily engrossed in it for like 2-3 days. I was so into the whole mystery thing, when the game warned me that I was at a critical point and that proceeding further would end other sidequests, I just created a save and pushed to the finish anyway. I went back later to load and finish the other side stuff. It's the kind of game you'd enjoy if you like getting your Speech skill to 100 in Fallout. It's very well-written and had some really great/shocking moments. Since it has very little actual "action" aside from delving inside the MC's thoughts, I understand that it's not for everybody, but it's certainly a worthwhile experience. I thought about writing a full review post, but maybe I'll save that for when/if I manage full achievement completion (looks tough!)

Playtime: Under 17 hours. 

Achievement completion: 9/45
