I'm thinking of getting a domain name and paid webhosting... there'sÂ [this host that's cheap and local][1]... . The main reason is I want to learn a web-based scripting language, maybe PHP. This is actually a no-brainer, as it's the cheapest of the things I'm thinking of getting... (new TV, new PC, DSL, new cellphone... ), but not yet, maybe by January...
