I got it same time as FFX-2. However, I can't get it to run... when I choose "Game" from the launcher, I just get the little spinning disc cursor for a while, then nothing. I've tried most of the stuff found in the accompanying troubleshooting doc, and I've sent Lucasarts a plea for help, but no response so far. Any help?

Actually I had the same problem with Neverwinter Nights when I first got it, and I was able to work that out by downloading the most recent patch. I'm guessing I'll need to wait for a KOTOR patch before I can play it. Oh well, it's not like I'm running out of things to play...
