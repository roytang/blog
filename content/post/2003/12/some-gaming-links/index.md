Today's random links:

[Insert Credit][1] 
   
- a nice website about gaming. I think the contributors all live in Japan, as they always seem to talk about prices in Yen. They've got some neat stuff, I wish I'd found their website before. Also, they keep talking about something called the GP32, and some of the things they say make me curious about it. It's some sort of gaming platform, apparently, but I'm too lazy to go through google and find out more details.

[Lost Levels][2] 
   
- covers games that were never made available to the general (well, American at least) public. They have this neat feature about the games that would have been Final Fantasy IV and Seiken Densetsu, but got cancelled; another nice feature is that they've uncovered a preliminary script for what would have been the NES release of the Japanese Final Fantasy 2... neat!
