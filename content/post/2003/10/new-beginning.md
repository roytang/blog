For as long as I have known about it, I have always liked this quote. It speaks of a certain ferocity, a certain stubbornness, a firm, unbending belief that whatever life throws at you, you will be able to not only handle it, but laugh in the face of its absurdity. This is how I would want my life to be; to be able to face any kind of adversity and address it without pause.

Enough rambling, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Roy, and this is my blog. Programmer, engineer, scientist, critic, gamer, dreamer, and kid-at-heart. I always thought I would find it preferable to code my own version of a blog, but time constraints have made me look for a simple, easy-to-use alternative. For now, I guess this blog becomes my main outlet to the internet. (Aside from email of course)

Hmmm... maybe I'll have more to say later. Until then, may the fates be kind to you.
