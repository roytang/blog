  "text": "Thanks for the info Ivy; I couldn&#x27;t find any definition through my quick reading of the relevant articles in the constitution, but I&#x27;m not a lawyer so I guess they have it hidden somewhere in jurisprudence or whatever. Out of curiosity, could they not have questioned the verification thing before the SC (or did they do that already? My recollection of the start of the trial is already weak...)    While I don&#x27;t have any concern with the use of technicalities per se (God only knows I&#x27;ve tried to use rules to weasel out of problems in the past), it becomes a problem when they become perceived mostly as being abused by the rich and powerful to get away with their shenanigans (and there were many instances of this during GMA&#x27;s time)",
