In this situation, I&#x27;m complaining because this is not a reason to celebrate. This process, if considered valid, will yield the same results against nearly anybody in government right now. That means the only distinction between impeached and legitimate is if one has not gotten in the way of the DOJ enough to warrant the same level of scrutiny.    This is a tool that has no safeguards beyond the fickle perception of the public. This is how we got GMA as president, and how Marcos rose to power. I&#x27;m not saying the same thing will happen, but just because the result *seems* favorable to people right now doesn&#x27;t mean that the means to get there were proper.",
