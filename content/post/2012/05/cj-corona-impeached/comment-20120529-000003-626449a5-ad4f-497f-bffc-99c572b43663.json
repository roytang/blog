  "text": "The problem is that the masses are so easily manipulated here. It&#x27;s not an improvement at all--it shows that those who are powerful can target those who are less powerful and break the rules if they can make it look good. This year, GMA is unpopular, so anything associated with her is fair game. Next year, Manny Pacquiao could declare that X is dishonest and through entirely the same process that just happened, arbitrarily get somebody impeached.    The law needs to be applied all the time, not just when it gives convenient results. In this situation, the only reason Corona was targeted was that it began with ad hominem attacks and because he voted in a way that displeased the DOJ. This exact situation could be applied to any political enemy now--because I&#x27;m certain that the vast majority of officials used exactly the same sort of technicalities to declare or not declare various aspects of their finances, thus anyone that votes in a way that is not kosher with the popular establishment can be tossed the same way under the guise of rooting out corruption.",
