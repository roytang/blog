  "text": "Ahem, YOUR bear driven system?    I think the major issue with the impeachment is that the public are not even aware that major shortcuts were taken during the proceedings. Unfortunately, the vast majority of the Filipino people will just see it as a victory of one of their boys against a filthy rich plutocrat. Most people seem to view politics like a teleserye, there&#x27;s always a humble hero and a rich villain.     In the end, I have a pretty poor opinion of the masses. Both sides played their hands as if they were in a penny theater rather than with proper respect for the rule of law, which is common enough in politics, especially in the Philippines.  &gt;_&lt;    It&#x27;s times like this I really really wish more Pinoys were educated in the things that matter.",
