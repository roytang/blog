  "text": "High five for being complainers! If only people would accept my bear-driven justice system...    I understand that people are being results-oriente d at the moment, that is a flaw of being human unfortunately. There is definitely a danger of abuse, but that danger has existed even before, since impeachment as enshrined in the constitution is a political process not bound by strict rules of evidence.    There is one safeguard against being victimized by this tactic - it&#x27;s by saying from the very start &quot;the law is vague about this point, I think I&#x27;ll interpret it in favor of transparency instead of my own interests&quot;; and that&#x27;s the kind of person we should be favoring as public servants.    At the very least, the trial has educated the public far more than the Estrada one did, because we stuck with the process until the end. If Estrada&#x27;s trial had happened after Corona&#x27;s, most likely the people would have been more willing to see Estrada&#x27;s trial through to the end.",
