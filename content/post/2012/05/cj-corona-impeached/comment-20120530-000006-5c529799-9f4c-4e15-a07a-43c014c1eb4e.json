  "text": "I think the Bear system is much more fair. At least we know that the bear is a bear, and it never pretends to be anything else.    To me, the danger of abuse in this situation is very, very high. We have a president that was only elected because his mother died at the right time. His signature platform is rooting out corruption... and now he has the tools to threaten and get his way and while his popularity rating is high enough, it is a positive feedback cycle--he just got rid of somebody for getting in the way of prosecuting GMA at lightspeed, now he can prosecute GMA at lightspeed, then he can get rid of a, b, and c, or threaten them into following what he wants, with each &#x27;success&#x27; a propaganda victory that tells the public what it wants to hear.    Being an official that is transparent isn&#x27;t even really a defense. How many documents were produced by the prosecution without a valid source? How many months of demonizing public press releases happened? By playing to the public, the current power-holders can create the impression of dishonesty with ease, and even if one turns out to technically be honest, an impeachment proceeding could vote a person out anyway, and in so doing, the impeachers ensure their own positions.",
