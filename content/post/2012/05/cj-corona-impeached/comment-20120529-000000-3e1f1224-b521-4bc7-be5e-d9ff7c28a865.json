  "text": "One shouldn&#x27;t be able to break the rules in trying to enforce them. This auto-invalidate s the case in countries that follow the rule of law. You can&#x27;t set aside the word of the law for the spirit of the law--who decides what that is? Secrecy of foreign accounts is the law, technicalities are the law, the congressmen having to read the complaint first before voting on it is the law.     The last time this happened, where extralegal shortcuts were taken because everyone was indignant we got GMA as president. The consequences of today are much longer lasting--it&#x27;s concrete proof that the law does not matter here in the slightest--popu lism, popularity and mob manipulation rule, and not the law.",
