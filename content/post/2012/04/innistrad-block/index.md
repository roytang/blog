Rolling all 3 Innistrad Block sets into a single recap.

<time>[2011-09-20 07:33] </time> Back from the Brink: If you exile a DFC creature, the token will be a copy of the front face and it won't be able to transform. - why not?

### Innistrad Prerelease

Attended the prerelease on Sep 24, 2011 @ [Eton Cyberpod](/locations/eton_cyberpod)

<time>[2011-09-24 20:25] </time> Some good pulls at today's #MTGINN prerelease, though I only managed to go 3-1 http://yfrog.com/kf3cfmyrj

{{% img src="24092011168" %}}

<time>[20:25]</time> I really wish I could find a local tournament venue that didn't offer hot, cramped playing areas and better chairs though :/

<time>[20:28]</time> The #MTGINN limited format seems fun, but it's kinda hard to not miss werewolf transforms on occassion.

<time>[2014-09-25 10:36]</time> These are all the rares I got in 9 packs at the #MTGINN http://yfrog.com/khbi9upgj Only 11 rares/mythics? Some people got 10 in six packs

### Dark Ascension

Wow, I played no paper events at all between Innistrad and Avacyn Restored prereleases!

---

<time>[2012-02-22 20:55] </time> Is it weird that Dark Ascension begins on MTGO right on Ash Wednesday?

---

<time>[2012-02-13 08:32] </time> Watching the Pro Tour Dark Ascension semifinals is gonna make me late for work

---

<time>[2012-02-24 12:59] </time> 3-1'd my sealed pool. Only loss was to Lingering Souls. Yes, both games

---

<time>[2012-02-26 13:33] </time> I've got to start drafting nonwhie

---

<time>[2012-03-03 13:54] </time> Just one sealed pool with Lilly, Garruk and Sorin would be great

---

<time>[2012-03-05 23:55] </time> all i want is to cast undying evil on a wurmcoil engine, is that so bad?

---

<time>[2012-04-25 22:01] </time> Still thinking about whether to attend the AVR prerelease. If only the prerelease card was better lol

### Avacyn Restored Prerelease

Attended the prerelease on Apr 28, 2012 @ Titan Hobby Shop

<time>[2012-04-28 05:45] </time> Went 3-1 at the midnight #MTGAVR prerelease. Hooray

People at the #MTGAVR prerelease kept talking about the helvault. The fools, that card isn't even in this set!

People at the #MTGAVR prerelease kept high-fiving me when I played this girl: {{% img src="hICGS" %}} Not sure why

Aaaaaand here's stuff from the helvault: 

{{% img src="28042012185" %}} 

Okay, I'm done tweeting about the #MTGAVR prerelease for now
