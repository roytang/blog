When I was growing up, our mom would make this sandwich spread concoction that was a mix of cheese, butter, sugar and milk. I loved it, and when my mom told young me what the ingredients are I quickly gave it the name "Cheetergarmi" (I'm sure you can figure it out). She still occasionally makes some for us to this day, just had some for a midnight snack!

Also, I pretty much wrote this post so that I could have a Google search term that returns a single hit to a blog post of mine.
