<time>[Fri, Sept. 14, 2012, 9:14 p.m.]</time> The new XCom is looking good, based on the RPS preview: https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/09/13/hands-on-forty-hours-with-xcom/ Kinda tempted to preorder it on Steam

<time>[Sat, Oct. 6, 2012, 8:03 p.m.]</time> I gave up resisting and went ahead and preordered XCOM

<time>[Sat, Oct. 13, 2012, 1:16 a.m.]</time> If I try out XCOM now, I might not get any sleep so I guess I'll save it til tomorrow.

<time>[08:31]</time> TFW you encounter a game-breaking bug one hour into an AAA game and you haven't saved yet

<time>[21:03]</time> PC games need to be able to respect second monitors - I want to be able to watch homeland while fighting aliens

<time>[Thu, April 17, 2014, 1:23 p.m.]</time> LP: X-Com Enemy Unknown Classic Ironman

Testing video capture. I don't have a mic, so no VO.

This covers only the first mission. Classic Ironman, so I'll probably die horribly a few missions in.
