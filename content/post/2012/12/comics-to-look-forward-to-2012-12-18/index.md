Well, missed posting about last week's comics due to some technical difficulties with my home computer, let's see if we can't get back on track.

There's a lot to look forward to this week on the Marvel side. There's <strong>All-New X-Men #4</strong> where we'll finally get to see Cyclops face off with his younger/older self. My other favorite so far of the Marvel NOW! books has the second issue this week: <strong>Avengers #2</strong> continues   the introductory arc to Jonathan Hickman's Avengers epic, let's see how he handles the large cast he's playing with. <strong>Hawkeye #5</strong> (David Aja returns!), <strong>Daredevil #21</strong> and <strong>X-Treme X-Men #8</strong> are all out this week, and while none of these are Marvel NOW! titles, they're currently some of the best books Marvel has to offer so they're always on top of my reading list. <strong>Uncanny X-Force #35 </strong>ends Rick Remender's celebrated run, hopefully <em>Uncanny Avengers</em> starts to get a lot better now that he has one less ongoing series. Also looking forward to new issues of the better Marvel NOW! books: <strong>Indestructible Hulk #2, Thor God of Thunder #3</strong> among others.

DC is still not too exciting for me at the moment, but I'm gonna be reading the books that continue their mini-crossovers. That's <strong>Green Lantern #15 </strong>and <strong>Green Lantern New Guardians #15 </strong>for <em>Rise of the Third Army</em> which has been a bit mediocre so far. Then <strong>Supergirl #15 </strong>for <em>He'l on Earth.</em> And of course there's <strong>Nightwing #15 </strong>and <strong>Red Hood and the Outlaws #15</strong> for the <em>Death of the Family</em> tie-ins. I heard Orion is getting introduced in the New 52 in <strong>Wonder Woman #15, </strong>hopefully I can catch up on that series soon.

Outside of Marvel/DC, this week also brings us a new issue of Brian K. Vaughn's new masterpiece - <strong>Saga #8 </strong>should easily be on the top of my reading list. If you haven't read it yet, <em>Saga</em> is some strange mix of <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> meets <em>Star Wars</em> meets <em>Lord of the Rings</em> and easily one of the best new series recently so you might want to check it out.
