<time>[2012-02-22 20:55] </time> Is it weird that Dark Ascension begins on MTGO right on Ash Wednesday?

---

<time>[2012-02-25 05:24] </time> It's 5:30am and I just 3-0'd a draft. Good start?

<time id="173208103481917440">[08:50]</time> Still thinking about whether to join the "top 8 sealed" release event at 9am. I'm not sure if I can take an 8-rounder today

<time id="173271265447129089">[13:01]</time> Currently 3-1 in my sealed event. Trying to convince everyone else in the event to just let me win.

<time id="173272302090321920">[13:05]</time> They should print a card that's "Creature Land - Forest Bears"

<time id="173278090070470657">[13:28]</time> There's nothing quite like the feeling of winning from 1 life :D

<time id="173307114779971584">[15:23]</time> Yes, 6-1! Win and in~

<time id="173320165725962240">[16:15]</time> Argh so close T_T Top 16 isnt so bad, but still

---

<time>[2012-03-06 00:16] </time> May not have been a good idea to start an MTGO commander game at midnight

---

<time>[2012-04-07 07:36] </time> Okay, so I decided to try out the MTGO cube https://i3.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/234/739/fa5.jpg

{{% photos fa5 %}}

Seriously, I have no idea what I'm doing. The first pack I opened had 3 mythics~ Holy crap that Taiga looks nice 

I had to cut a titan from my deck. This feels so ridiculous lol

Felt great keeping a one-lander, turn one Ancestral Visions, then going on to win the game

I'm glad I only have to fight annoying deck with top once per #mtgocube

---

<time>[2012-04-25 09:10] </time> [@mtgonline](https://twitter.com/mtgonline/) is there a way for me to check how many rewards points I currently have on mtgo?

---

<time>[2012-05-04 20:59] </time> Need to de-stress a bit. I think I'll play some cube

<time>[21:50]</time> p1p1 in mtgo cube: what's your pick?

{{% photos uzy6L %}}

<time>[23:24]</time> Yay 3-0'd my draft!

<time>[2012-05-05 16:59] </time> I always find myself gravitating to Esper colors in the MTGO cube

<time>[22:11]</time> Most interesting play today: blocked a Strangleroot Geist with a Puppeteer Clique. Still knew enough rules to predict I'd end up with both!

---

<time>[2012-06-22 10:51] </time> Raredraft much? https://i.imgur.com/heL77.png Those 2 mythics alone pay back this draft, and more. #mtg

<time>[19:48]</time> Played 3 drafts on MTGO today; the only round I lost were due to me watching Superman Returns during a crucial play =/ #mtg

<time>[19:48]</time> Still up around 30 tix, so it's still a good day. #mtg

<time>[2012-08-19 15:57] </time> Okay, i suck at mtgo today so i guess i should stop

---

<time>[2012-08-19 17:37] </time> MTGO seems to have crashed when I tried to save a 5,000+ card deck. I wonder if I should file a bug report.

---

<time>[2012-09-01 08:24] </time> Eternal Witness getting back Cryptic Command, leaving four mana untapped. So much value. #mtgpc

---

<time>[2012-09-01 10:07] </time> I've forgotten how ridiculous Momir Basic is

---

<time>[2012-10-21 09:28] </time> MTGO needs a shortcut for "tap this land for whatever color of mana, I dont even care"

<time>[10:30]</time> My flaky internet connection killed me in the last round of a sealed event again. =/

---

<time>[2012-11-03 08:38] </time> Quite possibly the most ridiculous rakdos draft ever: what do I cut?!?

{{% photos bBSpA %}}

<time>[08:40]</time> Well okay, I could have used a couple more Gore House Chain guys or whatever they're called

<time>[11:00]</time> What is best in life? Traitorous Instinct on an opponent's Wild Beastmaster, that's what

---

<time>[2012-12-01 10:20] </time> Sometimes you just ignore all the signals and just put together a ridiculous pile of cards that you hope will win through sheer force. #mtg

<time>[11:55]</time> I hate it when my impatience loses me a game. Damn fog effect =/ #mtg

<time>[14:52]</time> Note to self: If you have a bad draft, don't try to do another one. That's how tilt streaks happen #mtg

<time>[15:24]</time> Ugh, that was a bad idea #vaguestatus

---

<time>[2012-12-04 07:32] </time> Might've been a bad idea to draft while this sleepy #mtg

---

<time>[2012-12-29 09:14] </time> Guy complains about being manascrewed twice in a row when he has like six lands to my three in play. #mtgo

<time>[09:16]</time> "yeah, but you're still casting" Maybe it's because I have a smaller curve and only two colors? Jeez #mtgo

<time>[09:24]</time> When your opening hand is 2 forests, a green card and 3 white cards and you think "surely I'll draw a plains!", that's not mana screw #mtgo
