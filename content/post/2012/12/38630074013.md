<p>For some reason I remembered today this D&amp;D roleplaying session with some people a while back (I wasn&rsquo;t participating, just observing). The party had come into a village tavern looking for information, and there was this tavern wench who was acting a bit suspiciously in their eyes. As she exited the main tavern room (presumably to get more ale or whatever), one of the party members who for some reason was armed with a pitchfork declared that he would stop her from leaving the room by throwing the pitchfork in her path. A couple of disastrous rolls later and the tavern wench had died from a thrown pitchfork. Things escalated quickly and soon the party was holding the tavern patrons hostage inside the building as the local watch was trying to get in. The D&amp;D session didn&rsquo;t last long as I recall. Fun times!</p>
