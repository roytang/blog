#### Posted on r/hardware: [Looking for a replacement video card, around $100-$120 budget, suggestions?](https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/14y3fz/looking_for_a_replacement_video_card_around/)

My GTX460 vid card just died and I'm looking to buy a replacement tomorrow. I can't buy online, so I've been looking at price lists of some local stores.

I was planning to get an Inno3d GTX650, but the store I plan to buy from is out of stock of those. They have an Asus GTX650, but it's like 50% more expensive =/ (Not sure if there's a large difference between the brands). What alternatives should I be considering before I go out to the mall tomorrow?

I'm a gamer, but I'm not really the "play on ultra-high settings" kind of guy. The most graphically intensive game I've bought recently is probably Skyrim. 

I prefer Nvidia, but aside from preference, not many Radeon cards are being sold around here. Here's a sample price list from one of my local stores: http://i.imgur.com/onK51.png - prices are not in USD, they're in PHP, but roughly my budget should be around 5000+ or less in local prices. There's not many choices if I can't find an Inno3d GTX650...I'm willing to spend a little bit more if it will be more "future proof", but I'm not sure which of these cards would be a good buy at higher prices.

<time id="280643777062903808">[20:01]</time> Testing of the new video card: Skyrim, XCOM, Starcraft 2 all performed well.

<time id="282479315965321218">[2012-12-22 21:34] </time> I'm sure I was satisfied with my PC's performance before the vid card replacement, but now I kinda want an SSD and more RAM.
