<time>[Wed, Dec. 12, 2012, 8:29 p.m.]</time> Posted on Superuser: [Video card displays graphic artefacts](https://superuser.com/questions/518306/video-card-displays-graphic-artefacts)

When I came home today, my video card started displaying graphic artifacts, and logging in to windows 7 would cause the computer to reboot. The computer was working fine when i last shut it down last night.

Here's [a video of what's happening][1]. I have two monitors, in the middle of the video I pan to the second monitor. At about 0:24, I attempt to login and the machine reboots. My video card is an NVidia GeForce GTX 460.

Some more symptoms I've encountered and stuff I've tried over the course of several reboots:

- was able to login normally once, but after launching a few apps (chrome, tweetdeck), graphic artifacts started appearing again and the machine eventually froze
- am able to login successfully in safe mode
- sometimes the display is fine during the start up, and only starts getting wonky a few seconds after I go to the login screen by selecting a user to login with
- have encountered Windows failing to start up at all a couple of times (blue screen during startup)
- have tried System restore/repair a few times. i've already tried all the restore points available
- have tried uninstalling the vid card driver; machine boots and lets me login and use apps as normal but of course i'm at a low resolution (and won't be able to play games). tried to reinstall the vid card driver using automatic update; after the reinstall, same problem occurred

Now I'm not sure how to proceed; all signs point to the video card being damaged and probably in need of replacement; my question is are there any other things I can try first? 

Like, is it possible there's just something loose in the connections internally and I can try to remove and reconnect the card first? Or some alternative video driver to try? Or would a shop tech be able to do something to save the card? 

I don't have time to take apart the computer at the moment, probably I'll do it this weekend, but I'd like to know my options ahead of time.

#### Posted on r/hardware: [Looking for a replacement video card, around $100-$120 budget, suggestions?](https://reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/14y3fz/looking_for_a_replacement_video_card_around/)

My GTX460 vid card just died and I'm looking to buy a replacement tomorrow. I can't buy online, so I've been looking at price lists of some local stores.

I was planning to get an Inno3d GTX650, but the store I plan to buy from is out of stock of those. They have an Asus GTX650, but it's like 50% more expensive =/ (Not sure if there's a large difference between the brands). What alternatives should I be considering before I go out to the mall tomorrow?

I'm a gamer, but I'm not really the "play on ultra-high settings" kind of guy. The most graphically intensive game I've bought recently is probably Skyrim. 

I prefer Nvidia, but aside from preference, not many Radeon cards are being sold around here. Here's a sample price list from one of my local stores: http://i.imgur.com/onK51.png - prices are not in USD, they're in PHP, but roughly my budget should be around 5000+ or less in local prices. There's not many choices if I can't find an Inno3d GTX650...I'm willing to spend a little bit more if it will be more "future proof", but I'm not sure which of these cards would be a good buy at higher prices.
