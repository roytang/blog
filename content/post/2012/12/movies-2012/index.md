#### Shaun of the Dead (2004)

<time>[2012-04-06 07:50] </time> Watching: shaun of the dead #fb

#### Avengers (2012)

<time>[2012-04-25 16:19] </time> Avengers was very enjoyable, funny and action-packed. Re-reading Ultimates v1 now lol

#### Superman Returns (2006)

<time>[2012-06-22 16:12] </time> Watching Superman Returns. I don't think the movie would work without the John Williams soundtrack.

<time>[2012-07-02 19:46] </time> I don't know how they expect Peter Parker to be taken seriously as a tech guy when his default search engine is Bing

#### Amazing Spider-Man (2012)

<time>[2012-07-01 19:01] </time> Just saw Amazing Spider-Man. It's a completely different movie than Sam Raimi's version (and better IMHO), much more serious and drama tho

#### Lord of the Rings trilogy (2001-2003)

<time>[2012-07-01 01:07] </time> Spent the second half of the day watching the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

#### The Dark Knight Rises (2012)

<time>[2012-07-19 15:03] </time> TDKR spoilers: Wow. Nolan knows how to end a trilogy

<time>[2012-07-19 15:28] </time> TDKR: Fantastic movie, especially for people who've followed the Batman comics. Great ending!

#### Kung Fu Panda 2 (2011)

<time>[2012-08-05 21:45] </time> I accidentally watched kung fu panda 2

#### Bourne Legacy (2012)

<time>[2012-08-08 21:51] </time> Bourne Legacy was okay, though the ending was a weak. The last 1/3 of the film will be much more enjoyable for Filipinos than foreigners

#### Batman (1989)

<time>[2012-08-18 22:49] </time> Watching Batman (1989). In an alternate world Burton and Keaton continued the series after Batman Returns. Perhaps a better world.

And of course, in this fictional universe we get the first ever African-American Two-Face played by Billy Dee Williams

#### Bad Boys 2 (2003)

<time>[2012-09-23 13:37] </time> Watching Bad Boys 2, wondering why there are no cop movies in the Philippines

#### Skyfall (2012)

<time>[2012-11-03 19:30] </time> Re: skyfall, was it just me or was bond's plan terrible?

#### The Prestige (2006)

<time>[2012-12-01 20:27] </time> Now watching: the prestige

Re: The Prestige, great movie, though I was a bit disappointed with what tesla's machine turned out to be

#### Rurouni Kenshin (2012)

<time>[2012-12-08 00:48] </time> Woohoo, Rurouni Kenshin was great! Makes me want to rewatch the anime lol.

<time>[00:49]</time> Did you see the Rurouni Kenshin post-credits scene? Samuel L Jackson showed up to recruit him
