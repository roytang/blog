The previous night I played FNM using Naya Pod @ Titan Hobby Shop.

I said [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/roytang/statuses/208607465959460864/):

So, FNM last night was, as I put it on twitter, an unmitigated disaster. I won the first round and made a mental success baby pumpfist, but then went on to lose the next 3 rounds due to really bad decisions. For my round 2 opponent who was monoblack infect, I kept a hand which was 6 lands and a borderland ranger, which is ridiculous. There is no deck on earth which would ever want to keep that seven! I don't know what I was thinking. Ok well, yes I do, I was thinking "Surely I'm going to draw spells!" Remember, hope is not a valid strategy! And for the record, I drew three more lands in a row =/)

Round three was UB control. My play was generally tight, but I made a bad call in the third game playing my Zealous Conscripts too early to no real benefit. The sad fact of it is that I had even mentally called that my opponent was holding back for a Snapcaster + Doom Blade play and that my plan to kill him that turn wouldn't work at all, but I went ahead and risked it anyway. If he didn't have the play I would have looked like a genius, but instead, well. Bah.

Round four was RG aggro, and I made a boneheaded play at the start of game one when he swung an elf into my empty board after tapping out to play a sword of war and peace. I had the restoration angel to block, but only played it at end of turn. Doh! Of course the next turn that same elf gladly carried the sword and took me to school. And my ancient grudges never showed =/

Well, at least I learned a lot about how to play the deck, and that I still need to improve my own mental toughness a lot in prep for the GP. Next Saturday there's a PTQ so I'm looking forward to that. Hopefully I can clean up my sideboard too, I need to have it be a bit tighter. And my play too! Tight plays!
