Well i actually won a couple of packs this time but still #somanybadplays, went 4-3 at today's ptq

<time>[2012-06-10]</time> PTQ notes:

The venue actually seemed ok and was relatively accessible (via MRT), maybe I should have started coming here more often. I signed up and go!

Round 1 was vs Zax Ozaki with Solar Flare. He hit a bad patch of no blue lands in game one so I took it easily. Game two he fought back a bit but didn't draw much defense. We played a third game just for testing which he won with Blade Splicers into Sun Titans and stuff, so lucky that wasn't official.

Games: 2-0 Rounds: 1-0

Round 2 was vs Jan Ang with Restoration Delver/Mageblade. I won game one of an explosion of Hero of Bladehold + Gavony Township. Lost game two to a quick pair of Restoration Angels + sword of feast and famine. In game three I almost lost but he made a misplay that allowed by Birds of Paradise to survive his gut shot (thanks to the township!), preventing him from swinging for lethal.

Games: 4-1 Rounds: 2-0

Off to a great start! I was joking to Alex that I should just go home undefeated at this point lol.

Round 3 was vs Ralf something, I've played him a couple of times before. He had normal delver and steamrolled me two games. He gave me a few tips afterwards, on how he sideboards and stuff. Learning experience!

Games: 4-3 Rounds: 2-1

Round 4 was vs Jason Ascalon with Restoration Delver/Mageblade. I lost game one easily to two restoration angels (I need more maindeck ways of killing them - thinking of using Thunderbolts lol). In game two I made a stupid play of using an Acidic Slime to take out his third land after he had used phantasmal image to copy my borderland ranger. I later lost to an unanswered Feast and Famine. He pointed out later that I should have just reserved the Slime for the sword, since he had already gotten a land off the borderland ranger anyway.

Games: 4-5 Rounds: 2-2

A bit dejected, but I fight on!

Round 5 was vs Monored aggro. I turned game one around quickly with a mid-combat restoration Angel switching a Fiend Hunter and clearing his side of the board save a tiny Berserker. Game two he kept a six-hander with only one land and never drew a second one.

Games: 6-5 Rounds: 3-2

Round 6 vs UW control, I aggro'ed game one and brought him down to 3 life before he stabilized with Tamiyo. Game two I never got any good aggro footing in.

Games: 6-7 Rounds: 3-3

Round 7 (last round) was vs UR Delver (?) but the player was pretty loose. He would get blown out by cards he had already seen in my hand due to Gitaxian probe (he wasn't taking notes). I only lost the second game because I miscounted my Bladehold swing and thought I had him dead when it was only down to one life. Third game I pod into Acidic Slime to slow down his lands, into Titan for finisher but he bounces it for a while so I just bladehold him a bit before playing the Titan again at six lands. I realize then that he can play land into zealous conscripts into two gut shots to kill me, but luckily he doesn't have gut shots whee.

Games: 8-8 Rounds: 4-3

Not a very good showing, but at least it's nowhere near as disastrous as my FNM last week. And I managed to win two packs for my trouble! Though the two packs had nothing too exciting inside.

Need to tweak my deck a bit for the GP. I want to be more aggressive, and need more answers to Restoration Angel. Right now I'm considering adding Wolfir Avengers and Thunderbolts, and probably cutting Titan and Conscripts from the main. Maybe I'll also ask around on the MTGS forums for advice.
