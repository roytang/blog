Author's note: This story takes place before the start of FF6.

"Stop, thief!"

He heard the shopkeeper shouting after him, and grimaced. A couple of
years or so ago if someone told him he'd be stealing food off merchants in South
Figaro, he'd laugh in their faces. He was a different man then, with different
worries. The man he was today couldn't be bothered to think about such things as
honor or ethics. He was too busy thinking about food, and money. And his
research of course. He had to do his research. What did it all mean otherwise?
The months of living off stolen food and money, moving from place to place,
robbing scholars and merchants alike, living as a thief. Damn, he said to
himself. These aren't the thoughts to be having while being pursued by Imperial
Troopers. 

"Hurry up, Biggs, he's getting away!"

His somewhat stout companion was lagging a step or so behind him,
adjusting his brown helmet. But he couldn't afford to slow down and wait for
him, he thought as he saw his quarry turn right into the next alley. This had
been the chance they were waiting for, a chance to prove themselves to their
superiors. He sped up the chase as his prey knocked down a couple of merchant
stalls in his haste to get away. He looked around and tried to figure out where
his target was heading. Biggs was still right behind him, panting, but still
running. They had known each other since they were kids back in their hometown,
dreaming of becoming Imperial Generals. He looked back to his friend and shouted
an unnecessarily rough command.

"Biggs, he's headed for the west side exit! Get the Guards to cover that
side!"

Biggs nodded at Wedge words, and turned down the next corner to alert
the Figaro Guards on the west side. He was a bit miffed at Wedge' tone. They
were, after all, of equal rank, having been Sergeants in the Imperial Army for,
what, two years now? His mind flashed back to the time he and Biggs were
promoted, how happy they were that they were one step closer to their dream. He
remembered that dream and forgave his friend's words. He was merely excited
after all, since this capture would undoubtedly lead to a promotion. He caught
sight of the Figaro Guardsmen at their post, and stepped up his running a notch. 

Damn, he's still right behind me, the object of the soldiers' attention
said to himself. He was a pretty fast runner, but this guy was hot on his tail.
He glanced back at his pursuer as he jumped down the steps from the rampart to
ground level. He looks young, he thought to himself, probably hasn't even been
in the service five years, a private or a sergeant at most. He considered
stopping and pulling out the dirk in his belt, as the guy probably wouldn't
stand a chance. But he hated killing, and avoided it whenever he could. Besides
the guy just needed to hold him off for a few minutes before the Guard could
surround him. No, I'll just stick to the plan -- out the west side wall and off
to Narshe. He turned the corner, stopped and fell back as he caught sight of the
seven or eight Guards at the gate, with an Imperial Soldier commanding them. Oh
well, it was a bad plan anyway. He looked back to see the other soldier about to
pounce on him. He drew his blade and parried just before the sword cut off his
left arm. 

"Hey, take it easy! I'm a thief, not a murderer!" Not yet, at least.

"Hmph. I know who you are." Wedge made a feint, hoping to fake out a
counterattack. "We've had reports of your activities in this area for some time
now. And your time is up." When his opponent failed to counter, he followed
through, hoping to catch him in the right shoulder with a quick thrust.

"Sorry, kid," the thief said as he knocked the incoming blade to the
side.
"But there's no way I'm letting myself get caught here." He turned around
quickly, letting the man's thrust slide harmlessly behind him, and proceeded to
knock him down with the hilt of his blade. He heard the soldiers coming before
he saw them, so he started running again as his opponent fell to his knees,
hands massaging the back of his neck.

"Wedge, what happened?!"

"Don't worry about me, just go get that guy!"

As Biggs attended to his defeated partner, the thief looked back to see
seven Figaro Guards in hot pursuit. Damn, I guess I'll have to go out the other
side. I guess I'll be hiding in a cave again for a couple of days. He changed
his mind when he saw the guards gathered at the east side entrance. He sighed to
himself as he turned and ran up the stairs to the ramparts. Why did I always
come back to South Figaro anyway? South Figaro was well-manned, both by Figaro
Guards and Imperial Soldiers, mainly because most of the trade between the
Empire and Figaro passed through here. That meant a lot of merchants to steal
from, but it also meant you had a hell of a time escaping. Uh oh, he muttered as
he saw the two Imperial Soldiers who had chased him earlier right in front of
him. He looked around, jumping off the rampart was out of the question, there
were three guards on the ground level just waiting for him. And the other four
were right behind him. He stopped, shrugged, and turned to the two Troopers, a
despondent look on his face. It's not like he was worried about getting
captured. After all, he'd been captured before, and he would probably be out
again in a couple of days. What bothered him was that the chase was over. That
was all he really lived for these days, the thrill of the chase. That and
his...research of course.

"I guess you got me."

"Like I said, your time's up. By order of the Imperial Magistrate, you
are
under arrest, Locke Cole."

Biggs produced a pair of shackles and Wedge grabbed Locke, pinning his
arms
behind him. He was about to snap on the shackles when the Figaro Guards came up
to them.

"Release this man to our custody," the Guard Commander said to the two
Troopers. "He's wanted by the King of Figaro for crimes against the nation of
Figaro."

"What? This man is wanted under Imperial Law, and we came here
specifically
to bring him to the Emperor's justice." Wedge said. Although officially, they
were just stationed here as part of the "diplomatic envoy" to Figaro, they had
taken it upon themselves to prove their abilities to their superiors by catching
a notorious thief. "It is our duty to bring him back to the Imperial Capital for
summary execution."

Execution? Yeah, right. Locke wasn't worried about that. He felt a bit
miffed though, being fought over by two sets of soldiers.

"I'm sorry, Sergeant," the Guard Commander said, emphasizing Wedge's
rank.
"But this man was captured on Figaro territory, and the King's Guards get first
crack at him. We're allies, yes. But that doesn't give your Imperial Army
authority in these lands."

----------------

He was here again. It seems he was here every night. Wherever he was,
his
dreams almost always brought him back to this place. A place he hadn't visited
for little more than a year now. Kohlingen.
It seemed only yesterday he was living in this quiet little town, an
aspiring treasure hunter. He used to love this place. He wasn't very well off,
but he had a house here, a cozy little place he had inherited a long time ago.
He loved the people here, the atmosphere, and the scenery. And Rachel. Of
course, there was always Rachel.

"Don't be silly Locke," Rachel had said to him as they sat at their
usual
table at the town's only restaurant. "You've been in those caves a million
times. What makes you think you'll find anything new today?" She always needled
him about his 'job', or lack of it as the case may be. But she loved him. Of
this he was sure. He would never be able to provide for her in the way her
parents wanted, but he knew he loved her as well, and that he would always take
care of her.

"Just a feeling I got," he had said with his usual air of confidence.
"There was an unusual cleft I saw the last time I was in there. I'm pretty sure
that there are other artifacts in there like the last one." He had found an
ancient spear in the cave before, and a scholar had verified for him that it was
indeed an artifact, from the War of the Magi perhaps. Which was why he wanted to
explore the caves more. Rachel always worried about him, and he hated worrying
her. But a few more artifacts like that, and the two of them could probably be
set for life.

"No good will come of these 'artifacts' you know," had Rachel said in
her
most lecturing tone, "the War of the Magi ended a thousand years ago, and
digging up long-forgotten weapons won't help the peace any. Who knows, one of
these weapons you excavate could catch the interest of the Empire. What would
happen to Kohlingen then?" Rachel's father was a scholar, a historian who
studied the War of the Magi. So her father always told her of the horrible
struggle that ended a thousand years ago, and how they should all learn from
history's mistakes. She smiled at him, "After all, if something were to happen
to our little town, where would we live when we got married?" Locke's face went
red at the memory of her smile.

----------------

Locke woke up to the sound of a voice from the other side of his cell
wall.
Oh well, he said to himself. I've dreamed the same dream a thousand times
anyway. The voice behind the wall repeated itself.

"What?" Locke said to the wall.

"Hey, you're awake. I heard the guards talking about you. Is it true
you're
Locke Cole?"

"Yeah, what of it?" he responded cautiously.

"Wow! I've always wanted to meet you! You're my hero! I've heard all
about
your 'jobs' back in the Empire!"

Locke sighed. It's bad enough he was a thief. Now he was a famous thief.
With an enthusiastic fan. He curled up and tried to get back to sleep. "You're
thinking of someone else, just let me sleep."

Apparently his excited prison mate hadn't heard him. "I'm Lone Wolf, the
pickpocket. I mean, I'm just a pickpocket now, but someday I'm gonna be a famous
thief like you! So, when are you planning to escape? You are planning to escape,
right?" Another two-bit crook, Locke figured. They were being held in the prison
in the basement of Figaro Castle. The Guards had taken him here after a rather
heated argument with the two Troopers. He figured he'd stay for a couple of
days, if only to take advantage of the free food. But his 'friend' behind the
wall didn't need to know that.

"I'm not gonna escape. Just go to sleep."

"What? You can't be serious! I mean, they probably won't execute us like
the Empire would, but--"

The voice trailed off at the sound of the far doors of the prison
creaking
open, something eerily noticeable in the darkness. A couple of guards walked up
to his cell, one of them carrying a candle. Behind them, Locke could see the
silhouette of a tall, robed man.

"Locke Cole?" The robed man turned to the guard for confirmation. "The
King
wishes to see you."

Locke wondered what the King of Figaro would want with him as the Guards
opened his cell and brought him to his feet.

"Be strong, man!" His unseen friend spoke out to him again, albeit in a
more subdued voice. "You can get out of this!" He never heard from that guy
again.

----------------

Edgar Roni Figaro, king of the small nation of Figaro, was in his throne
room. You'd think someone who was royalty would be surrounded by servants
willing to do his every bidding. But Edgar didn't really like servants hovering
around him, except for the occasional pretty servant girl perhaps, but not
today. Today, there were greater concerns to be met.

The king of Figaro was conversing with a bearded old man standing in
front
of his throne. If not for the throne, one might think Edgar actually deferred to
the old man, instead of being the king that he was.

"Are you sure about this, old friend?" Edgar asked the old man.

"He would be a great help to us, I'm sure," came the reply, "and you
know
we need all the help we can get."

"How can you be sure he'd agree?"

"Just leave it to me." The old man smiled knowingly.

The Chancellor of Figaro, wrapped in his flowing red robe with golden
trimmings, strode into the throne room. "Beg your pardon, your majesty, but the
prisoner is here."

"All right, bring him in." Edgar nodded briefly to the old man, who then
moved conveniently to the shadows in the far wall.

The two guards nudged Locke into the throne room. He complied and walked
into the room with no hint of awe or majesty at Figaro's throne room. It was
majestic, yes, worthy of a king, but nothing he had not seen before. The guards
brought him before the throne.

"Kneel." The guard gruffly ordered, and Locke felt his head pushed to
the
ground.

"Get up, you know I hate that." Edgar said. The guards complied, lifting
Locke back to his feet. Locke looked up at the king of Figaro. He's younger than
I thought, Locke said to himself, what does he want with me?

Locke looked around the room and took note of any means of escape. There
were six other guards, aside from the ones holding him, and two more outside the
door; the fat old chancellor who had taken him out of his cell; and an old man
standing to the side, trying to remain unnoticed. Who is he? Some sort of
servant?

He heard the king speak again and focused his attention to the throne.
"Thank you for bringing him here, Chancellor. Please leave us, I wish to speak
to him in private."

"But your highness," the Chancellor started, a bit ruffled, "We can't
leave
you alone with this--"

"It's alright." Edgar looked at the guards. "And please remove his
shackles."

The guards looked at one another before complying. Locke felt the
shackles
come off, and rubbed his wrists to warm them. He saw the king nod to the other
guards, and they accompanied the chancellor out the throne room.

"With all due respect your highness," Locke finally said, "You sure you
wanna be alone with me? I'm a dangerous thief you know."

Edgar smiled. No respect for authority in this one, he thought to
himself.
He looked to the shadows on the wall, and the old man stepped forward. Locke
finally got a good look at him, although he still couldn't recognize the man.
The old man spoke.

"Yes, we know all about you Locke Cole. A very daring thief, who has
conducted various operations throughout the imperial domains and beyond over the
past few months."

"You've got quite a reputation you know," Edgar said, looking directly
at
him, "You're wanted for about twenty-seven charges of theft, breaking and
entering and evading arrest in Figaro alone. You're lucky we don't execute
thieves like the Empire does."

"The Empire..." Locke thought a bit before speaking again. "Listen, I
don't
know what dirty work you and your allies want me to do, but I don't care. I may
be a thief but there's no way I'm doing Gestahl any favors!"

"Well said." The old man spoke again. "Just what we would have expected
from you. And just what we wanted." He paused before going on. "We are not the
Empire."

"What are you talking about old man? Figaro's practically Imperial
territory with all those soldiers running around and your king bowing and
scraping to that old dog of an Emperor--!"

"Hey, hey," Edgar interrupted. "The king of Figaro doesn't bow or scrape
to
anyone. The Empire and Figaro are allies, yes. Equally? No. They forced this
alliance down our throats, knowing we had no choice, but Figaro will never bow
down to the Empire."

"So what are you doing here, then?" Locke sneered, "Hiding in your
desert
castle while Imperial Troops harass your people and tax your merchants."

"Allow me to explain," the old man said. "Edgar here, king of Figaro,
and
myself, are members of a small underground group working to destabilize the
Empire."

"Rebels?" Locke said incredulously. "You've got to be kidding. There's
no
way Figaro's army could stand up to the Empire. They've only used a fraction
their power to dominate the Southern Continent, and even the King of Doma is
having a hard time against them!"

"That's exactly why Figaro is still openly an ally of the Empire." Edgar
explained. "We have no intention of meeting them in war, as that would only
result in a bloody loss. But once Doma falls, it's pretty certain that Figaro
will be their next target."

"We have no means of fighting them, really," the old man continued,
"Except
with our hearts and with our minds. We have supporters scattered throughout the
Empire, waiting for our word. We have people disrupting Imperial supply lines,
sabotaging their machinery. We may not be able to topple them today, or anytime
soon, but we will eventually. But we need help. We need more people."

"People like you," Edgar said, looking directly at Locke.

"What do you think I can do?" Locke said, "I'm just a thief. I can't do
anything against an Empire!"

"'A small stone may make a ripple at first, but someday it will be a
wave.'" Edgar said, "An ancient quote."

"You are no ordinary thief, Locke Cole." The old man said, "You were
once
the best treasure hunter in Kohlingen. We need someone like you, someone who can
work their way through Empire lands, disrupting their communications and supply
lines, providing and gathering information. And most importantly, to contact our
allies. It has become increasingly dangerous for me to meet with our allies like
the king here."

"If the Empire finds out we've been meeting with our allies in secret,
it's
hard to tell what they'd do." Edgar said, "Especially since some of our contacts
are deep inside the Imperial hierarchy. What do you say? Not much pay, but you
don't really do these things for the money do you?"

Locke paused for a while. These guys knew him inside out, and his
conscience begged him to help them out. But there were other things he had to
do, something else he was fighting for.

----------------

His memory flashed back to that fateful day. He had wanted to show
Rachel
the buried ruins he had found in one of his explorations up on Mt. Kolts. With
all the artifacts there, he was pretty sure they would be pretty much set for
life. It had taken him a while to convince her to come with him, but he
eventually got her to agree.

"Don't worry, I'll watch over you every step of the way." He grinned at
her
as they strode up the mountain path.

"I'm sure you will," Rachel replied, "the same way you were watching
over
that bar girl the other night, eh?" She smiled at him teasingly.

"Hey, I told you, she looked just like my cousin!" Locke smiled right
back
at her. "The cave's just beyond the next bridge."

"We'd better hurry," Rachel said, pulling close to him. "If my parents
find
out I've been gallivanting with you--"

"--they'd chase me out of Kohlingen, right. Don't worry, I'll just show
you
what I've found, and have you back in Kohlingen before your father can give you
one his trademark lectures." Locke stopped and faced her, made a stern face and
started to mimic her father. "I don't know what you see in that Locke fellow!
He's a regular rapscallion, that he is! He'll do you no good, you hear!"

Rachel laughed at him and slapped him lightly on the chest. "Knock it
off,
okay? I can see the bridge already."

Rachel had stopped at the summit just before the bridge. She looked off
into the southward horizon, at the small town seemingly a lifetime away.

"South Figaro looks so... small from up here." This was the first time
she
had ever climbed a mountain, and the natural beauty she could see amazed her. "I
could see for miles... everything is so... pristine..."

"C'mon Rachel, you're the one who told me to hurry!"

"Oh... yes." She said, hurrying over to him. "I would be a little more
excited if you maybe told me what it is we're going to see."

"You're not gonna believe what awaits us up here!" Locke said as he
crossed
the bridge. "Come on, it's worth a fortune!"

Everything else had seemed to happen in slow motion. It was a moment he
had
relived time and again. His footing had been wrong, and he had felt the bridge
begin to give way. He heard her shouted warning, but had been caught unawares
when she threw herself at him. He had been so surprised that he wasn't able to
put up any resistance. He had felt himself pushed back to the far end of the
bridge. He had stumbled clumsily, and his instinct took over as he jumped clear
of the collapsing bridge. He had looked back, and she was not there. He ran to
the edge of the ravine, shouting her name without hearing anything. He had
climbed down after her, and everything else was a blur. Rushing her back to her
father's house, the worried looks on her parent's faces, the relief when the
doctors said she'd be fine, and finally, that blank look on her face when she
woke up to him. No gleaming eyes or bright smile. Simply an emotionless stare,
as if she had never seen him before.

Her parents had been outraged, but he had just sat there, not knowing
what
to do or say. He tried to speak, but Rachel's father wouldn't even hear of it.
He was chased out of Kohlingen by nightfall, nowhere to look or turn.

He couldn't remember how he had wound up in South Figaro, or how long he
had been there. He didn't know how he was able to survive, living off food he
found or stole off the streets. Somehow, he found himself under the care of an
old scholar who had retired to South Figaro. The weeks of desperation had taken
their toll on him and he was bedridden for several days. But he had found
comfort with the old man who listened to his story, the only one he ever told it
to. He had poured his heart out, sometimes with tears running down his face, as
he recounted Rachel's tragedy. Luckily, his newfound friend had with him a
glimmer of hope that brought him out of his stupor.

"I can't be sure about this, you know," The old scholar had droned in
his
monotone voice, "But I seem to recall an old chap a while back who had done
research on this sort of thing... memory loss and recovery, I believe." Locke
remembered how his face had lit up when he realized what the old man was saying.
A cure? Rachel's condition can be cured?

"Well, as I said, it's somewhat of a long shot," the old man said, "but
I
think the old chap was one of the Empire scientists."

And so his hunt had began. After thanking his benefactor, he had set off
for Imperial territory, determined to find a cure for her recovery. He lived by
stealing off merchants and Imperial officers, traveling throughout the Southern
continent, asking scientists and researchers about this so-called cure.

And all for what? Locke asked himself as he considered the offer being
made
to him. He had been searching for almost a year now, with not even a single
clue. He was wanted for numerous crimes throughout the empire, but he couldn't
even sneak into the fortress at Vector to question their scientists. Maybe, this
job was the right thing for him to do? No, he decided. He had already devoted
too much time and effort to what he was doing, it all had to mean something, he
had to do it, for Rachel.

"I'm sorry," He replied to Edgar and the old man, "I understand your
needs,
but there are some things I just have to do, some things that are more important
to me."

Edgar frowned a him. "I don't think I have to remind you that you're a
criminal under my jurisdiction." He looked straight at him, "I hold your life
in my hands."

"Is that supposed to be a threat?" Locke said mockingly, "I've escaped
worse fates than this before." He stood there defiantly, as if daring Edgar to
strike him.

"Now, now, no need to be hostile to each other", the old man said
soothingly. The two backed down a bit. He looked at the young king. "Edgar, no
need to be rough with him, is there? I'm sure you can arrange a 'pardon' for
this young man, can't you? So that he can consider our offer." He turned back to
Locke. "Please take the time to consider it, you don't have to decide now." The
old man looked at Edgar, "Well?"

"All right, tell you what," Edgar sighed resignedly, "I'll tell some of
the
guards at the night shift to take an early break around midnight, okay? Just
don't hurt any of my guards."

The old man nodded and turned back to Locke. "We can't force you to help
us, that isn't our way. But please think about it. If you wish to contact me,
talk to Arvis of Narshe, I'm sure you know him." He smiled at Locke. "My name is
Banon."

"Or, you could just get yourself caught again," Edgar grinned as he went
to
call the guards back.

----------------

Locke nudged his chocobo to go just a bit faster. He was anxious, and at
the same time worried. He hadn't been back to Kohlingen for the past year, but
he needed to go back now. He needed to reassure himself that he was doing the
right thing, to remind himself what he was fighting for.

His conscience had been bothering him since the guard brought him back
to
his cell. He had wanted to catch a couple of hours sleep before midnight, but he
kept thinking about what it is that he was he was doing. He was on a wild-goose
chase, he could recognize that, for some cure that may or may not exist. But he
had to do it, because he owed it to her, to fight for her. To protect her. But
now, he had turned his back on people who needed him, people he could help, to
pursue this unknown cure. Had he met the right choice? He would know when he saw
Rachel again.

Sure enough, the guards left around midnight, and Locke had been the
only
prisoner awake. He had looked around warily, still not sure what to make of the
situation, but then started to work on the cell's lock. Nothing too difficult,
he was out of the dungeon in three minutes. He had promised not to hurt any of
the guards, but he had to knock a couple of them unconscious and steal a
chocobo.

And now here he was, just a couple of miles to Kohlingen now, and he
would
see her again. He didn't need to talk to her, just to see her. To remind himself
of what he was doing, and why.

Off the horizon, in the direction of Kohlingen, he sighted a thick
pillar
of black smoke rising from the ground. Worried, he kicked his chocobo into high
gear.

----------------

The sight was disturbing. The slightest traces of dawn had begun to
appear,
and the rays of light seemed to grotesquely outline the destruction that had
happened here. Several houses were burned to the ground, some had collapsed on
themselves, now simply a heap of wood and rubble. As Locke rode into the city
and through the empty streets, he could feel several eyes looking out of the
houses that were still standing.

"What the hell happened here?" Locke pondered for a moment before his
heart
took over again. "Rachel!"

He got off his Chocobo, and took a shortcut down a narrow alley. Looking
around, he saw that most of the brick-and-mortar houses here had survived
whatever it was that caused this carnage, so he figured Rachel and her family
would be alright. His stomach turned as he saw the remnants of their house
collapsed on the ground like a random pile of rocks. He stood there gaping for
several moments before he heard someone call out to him.

"Master Locke!" Seymour, Rachel's family's manservant, came running up
to
him. He was a skinny man in his late forties, and he was often sympathetic to
Locke and Rachel's relationship even when his master didn't approve.

"Seymour!" Locke said in relief, "What happened here? Where's Rachel?"

"It was the Empire, sir!" Seymour spilled, as he stopped in front of
Locke,
gasping for breath. Even though he was almost fifty, he had always insisted he
was healthy enough to run a marathon. "They came through here last night, saying
'Imperial enemies' had been hiding here." He looked around. "They burned down
and destroyed houses and buildings with some new weapon they had. MagiDuck, or
something such, sir! A ghastly meld of monster and machine, a weapon of
destruction..." He looked at Locke, "It's good to see you again, sir, despite
the circumstances..."

"Rachel!" Locke almost shouted, "Where is she? Is she alright?"

Seymour hesitated before replying. "Best you go see for yourself sire,
she's at Largo's right now."

Locke nodded, and hurried off. "Thanks, Seymour. Get some rest, you
hear?"

Putting aside his concerns for Seymour's health, Locke made his way to
the
herbalist's shop. Old Largo, the medicine man of Kohlingen, had done many good
things for him back when he was still climbing mountains and all. Hopefully,
Rachel would be alright.

----------------

He had been sitting on this bench for half a day now. He felt so
useless.
All his efforts, all his sacrifices to find a cure for Rachel, and what happens?
He's not there for her at the time she needed him most. Largo had told her what
happened, how their house had collapsed on top of them. Seymour and the others
had dug through the rubble, expecting to find only their dead bodies. Rachel's
parents didn't make it. But surprisingly, Rachel did. She had been holding
something in her hand when they found her, gasping for breath, bruised and
battered all over. She had been delirious and weak as they carried her to
Largo's for treatment, mumbling all the way. Once they laid her down on a bed,
she had promptly collapsed and had not awakened since. She had dropped whatever
it was she was holding, a small pendant which had given her something to live
for, which Largo had seen fit to give to Locke.

He fingered the small pendant Largo had given him, and opened the
locket,
the same way he had been doing for the past few hours. The picture inside was a
bit burned at the edges, but he could nonetheless see their faces so clearly.
Locke and Rachel. They had taken this picture several months before the
accident, and she had promised to treasure it forever. He closed the locket and
slammed his fist into the ground as he recalled Seymour's words. "She was
mumbling your name all the way, sir, even before we found her in the rubble, and
up to the time she fainted."

"So bloody useless," he muttered to himself, "What the hell have I been
doing this past year, what the bloody hell has it all been for?"

He remembered Largo telling him about her condition. He said she was in
bad
shape, and that it was a miracle she survived. He had given her some medicine to
keep her from the brink of death. But that was the best he could do. He didn't
know whether she could be revived in any way. The herbs would keep her like
this, in a form of suspended animation, for a long while, but that was the best
he could do. For all intents and purposes, it was as if she were already dead.

Bloody useless, Locke repeated to himself. What could he do now? Raise
the
dead? A slight rain began to fall.

"Master Locke," he heard Seymour's voice behind him, "You should get
some
rest. And get out of the rain, sir."

He ignored him for a while, and eventually Seymour's voice vanished from
his hearing.

The next dawn found him still in the spot, staring lazily at the
herbalist
shop across the street. The rain had stopped a few hours before, but he was
still quite drenched. He felt his eyelids starting to fall, for the umpteenth
time now, and snapped himself awake. He heard footsteps behind him.

"I'm sorry." The voice was the old man's. The one he had met in Figaro
Castle. What did he say his name was? Oh yeah, Banon.

"I came up here as soon as I'd heard." The old man sat down beside him.
"We
knew of your history with the girl here in Kohlingen, and we knew that was why
you didn't want to join us. Too bad things had to be like this."

Locke's silence disturbed him but he went on, "Listen, about the
offer..."
Banon wasn't sure what to say, but he decided to press on, "...we understand if
you choose to decline. After all it must be a difficult time for you ri--"

"I'll do it."

"--ght now. Eh?" Banon turned to him in surprise.

"Rachel would've wanted me to help you guys, I guess," Locke said
resignedly, "She always said the Empire would someday threaten Kohlingen. I
never really listened to her."

"Locke--"

"Don't worry about me. I've had a long time to think about things. I
sacrificed a lot of things trying to bring back the Rachel I knew, only to have
the Empire take her away again. I owe it to her to fight for the ideals she
believed in. I have to do this now, or else, it all has no meaning."

The old man nodded. "Very well. I'll be staying at the inn. When you're
ready, just look for me there alright?"

Locke nodded. He stood up and looked down at himself. "I guess I should
clean up a bit, huh? Maybe Largo's awake already." He started towards the
herbalist's shop.

"Oh and Locke," Banon started to say.

Locke looked at him questioningly.

"Welcome to the Returners."
