### Movies

#### DC League of Super-Pets (2022)

Watched on 2024-02-03: ★★★★



{{% photos dc-league-of-super-pets-2022 %}} Watched this with 3 of the pamangkins and all 3 sat with rapt attention throughout the movie, a sure sign of a good animated kids movie. Some great jokes in there too.

#### Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014)

Watched on 2024-03-03: ★★★



{{% photos teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-2014 %}} I think overall this was ok as an adaptation even though (a) the Turtles are huge; (b) Splinter learned Ninjitsu from a book?!? Kinda weird to tie the Turtles' origin directly to April's childhood, but it kinda worked. I like the tongue-in-cheek addressing of the rumors that Michael Bay would make the Turtles aliens.

#### Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows (2016)

Watched on 2024-03-07: ★★★½



{{% photos teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-out-of-the-shadows-20 %}} I didn't actually know this sequel existed until I saw it on NF. This actually landed a bit better for me than the first film. The audacity to have a live-action Krang! And Bebop and Rocksteady were great! (Even if they were all CGI lol). Surprised to see Arrow and Sheamus in this film! Disappointed at Baxter Stockman not being mutated.

#### American Fiction (2023)

Watched on 2024-03-16: ★★★★½



{{% photos american-fiction-2023 %}} This was unbelievably good and also unbelievably meta and I just couldn't help smiling at the irony of that ending. It is a comedy, but as one of the characters themselves say, it's not a ha-ha comedy, more of a sad comedy.

#### Dune: Part Two (2024)

Watched on 2024-03-18: ★★★★½



{{% photos dune-part-two-2024 %}} I don't remember much of the book's plot, though I think the film largely follows it, with some divergences. The film is visually spectacular, as one would expect from this director. I saw it in the cinema on like the fourth week so there weren't a lot of people so I was able to find a good seat. I saw the first one at home and watching this one in the cinema made a huge difference in the visual impression and meant being able to enjoy much better sounds than at home. It also means no pausing for pee breaks, which was challenging for 2.75hr movie; towards the end I was already out of my seat and in the hallway waiting for Muad'dib to get it over with so I could run to the toilet. Luckily there was no post-credits scene.

Favorite scene: attempting to ride the sandworm.

#### Ricky Stanicky (2024)

Watched on 2024-03-20: ★★★½



{{% photos ricky-stanicky-2024 %}} Felt very much like a Farrelly brothers movie. Even managed a feel-good ending somehow. Enjoyed Cena's performance. This is the first Zac Efron film I have ever seen.



---

#### Road House (2024)

Watched on 2024-03-23: ★★★½



{{% photos road-house-2024 %}} I've never seen the Swayze original. I liked this one. Jake Gyllenhall was great. I saw this with my mom and I don't think she's seen any of his movies, so I ask her to guess who he is, and she's like "Isn't he Spider-Man?" So close.

Plot was not very surprising but it's some good action and the fight choreography is great and there are some clever bits in there that made me LOL. McGregor is great for his role, he's so pyscho.

### TV

#### Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan season 3 and 4

Previously: [season 1](/2018/10/october-2018-watching-lately/), [season 2](/2021/08/movies-tv-may-aug-2021/#tom-clancys-jack-ryan-season-2)

I think Season 3 was my favorite one of this entire run, maybe because in my head I mostly associate the Jack Ryan character with the cold war stuff, and someone goading Russia and the US into a war felt like classic Jack Ryan/Tom Clancy. Fourth season was meh and a bit short and I have trouble taking Michael Pena seriously after first taking notice of him in Ant-Man.

#### Abbott Elementary season 2

Previously: [season 1](/2023/03/abbott-elementary-s1/)

Season 2 was mostly more of the same. They introduced a rival school and more character backstories. The series remains extremely good for light-hearted background watching. Season 3 is already up on D+, not sure when I'll watch it.

#### Others still ongoing

Have been enjoying so far: Shogun, Invincible S2, X-Men 97
