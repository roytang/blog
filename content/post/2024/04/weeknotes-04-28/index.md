### The world

US colleges are experiencing a wave of pro-Palestinian protests demanding Universities cut their ties to Israel, etc. Some authorities have responded with militarized police forces breaking up protests and arresting protestors, giving everyone a valuable lesson in what fascism looks like.

The US has banned Tiktok! Bytedance is now forced to either sell their stake or Americans lose Tiktok (or they challenge it in court). As a [word person](/2022/11/word-web-persons/), I don't especially care for Tiktok, but I dislike the whole concept of banning apps because we don't like the country they come from. That's not what the internet should be about, and risks a chain reaction that leads to a balkanized internet. If Tiktok's behaviors are problematic, especially from a privacy POV, then ban those behaviors instead. But then again, US Big Tech wouldn't like that would they?

### My Week

We had immunotherapy session no. 6 last Monday. It went ok, except there were a lot of patients this time and for some reason we were processed last, so we were basically in the hospital all day. At least it gave me some to get some administrative paperwork done and filed with the hospital properly, a process that involved some long queues.

The week was generally less exhausting than the prior two weeks, thankfully. This meant I started to get back to my old rhythms and started work again on some long-stalled side projects (including something I wanted to implement on this blog/site).

There were a couple of birthdays in the family this past week, but we are only getting together to celebrate later today. We did go out for a celebratory breakfast at one point (just the household members), but turns out we underestimated how early restaurants would be open and ended up wandering around the nearby shops until we found one that was already open.

Yesterday outside the church there was a couple selling hopia and other snacks from the back of a van, which seemed kinda shady. I later found out my dad had bought some. The hopia were good!

Being at home more often however meant suffering more under the sweltering hot weather, especially in the afternoons. Sometimes we get scattered rainshowers, but these are minimal relief at best, and right after we can feel the increased humidity making the heat indexes much worse. I've tried various interventions to make my room more comfortable, but it is a challenge. No matter what, the heat starts to become unbearable around 3pm to 5pm, when I generally have to leave the comfort of my desktop for the comfort of an airconditioned room or downstairs. I can still do stuff on my laptop, but those are generally less productive hours.

Trivia team was supposed to attend a quiz night last Thursday, but that got postponed TWICE so no more quizzes until next month.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still just mostly just playing **Stellaris** when I can. Might give the game a break again after the current run. I installed **Fallout 4** (see below) and **Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes** which just dropped on Game Pass this past week; not yet sure which one I'm actually gonna start. Logically it should be the one I've never played before, but it kinda depends on my mood I guess?
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Thunder Junction drafts are going reasonably well, though with only one trophy so far. I have already hit Platinum rank, at which point the drafts always get harded, so I might wait a few days for rank reset before proceeding!

  
- **Reading**: Not a lot this week, a few comics here and there maybe. I have fallen waaay behind on my reading targets.

- **Watching**: Shogun had it's finale this week, and I almost immedaitely started writing [my review](/2024/04/shoguntv/). Am only one episode into Prime Video's **Fallout** TV show, and it already made me want to wander the wasteland again. Still haven't started: Star Trek Discovery final season. 

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 70,035 steps. First time hitting the target again after a couple of busy weeks! I briefly considered just lowering my weekly target during these sweltering hot months, but it's not like I'm super strict with myself anyway. 10k steps a day is still good to aspire for, even if I don't always hit it.

I've been trying out walking with one of my mom's walking sticks recently, mostly so I have something to help fend off dogs that are sometimes very hostile especially when walking late at night, but I find they are also generally helpful for the walking part, essentially distributing my weight to a third leg, and it is nice to have a walking stick when I pass by the uneven sidewalks, some of which have steep rises. Still, probably not gonna be a regular occurence.

### Website Changes

Not much publicly available yet this week. Working on some things on the backend.

Looks like some answers to the [triviabot](https://botsin.space/@triviastorm) have been getting delayed or lost recently, had to make some fixes.

    TBH, I never got around to figuring out how passkeys were supposed to work, every explanation seemed to require me to trust either Apple or Google or whatever so I just ignored them mostly

    I can only imagine how godlike it must feel to be one of the engineers who managed to successfully remotely debug software running on 46-year old hardware some 24 billion kilometers away. It would surely feel like the pinnacle of one's career and craft!
