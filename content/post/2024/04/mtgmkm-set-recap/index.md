### Set Notes

- The previous set [Lost Caverns of Ixalan](/2024/01/mtglci-set-recap/) was my all-time worst limited performance for an Arena premier set. I was actually doing much better with MKM, at least until I hit Platinum! Oh well, I'm just happy to finish at an above 50% win rate!
- Despite having trouble at Platinum rank, I still kept drafting because honestly, MKM is a fun draft format. Disguise is a great upgrade to morph and I love those hybrid discard cost creatures that fit in multiple decks. The format felt very aggro/tempo focused and you wanted to be playing as many cards as possible each turn (well, this is generally true of MTG) and having disguise cards definitely helped with that. Two drops that could compete vs the 2/2 morphs were high value!
- I kind of favored the controlly-side of the limited format though, favoring black decks in general with their plentiful removal. I really liked Extract a Confession since it could easily handle the inevitable turn 3 disguise plays from your opponent. 
- This was the first set that replaced draft boosters with play boosters, and that was certainly an adjustment and a challenge, since you are likely to be getting multiple rares per pack, so the temptation to raredraft and wreck your draft was pretty strong!
- Flavor-wise, I get the complaints; I certainly did not instinctively feel like this was a Ravnica set. But I think they hit the "murder mystery" flavor out of the park!
