### The world

Israel's Gaza genocide lost further support as they "accidentally" killed some aid workers from World Central Kitchen. China continues to bully and harass PH ships in our own territory. Earthquakes and eclipses. This weekend is Wrestlemania weekend.

### My Week

We had our 5th infusion session last Monday, it went okay, although there were a lot of people around this time. Aside from that, it was one of those rare weeks where I had my own medical errands to run as I was due for my regular tests and consultation with my doctor. As is typical, I spent way too much time in the doctor's waiting room. I finished a book while waiting!

My mom has been going through the stuff in the spare room to see what we can throw out, and I've had to pop in there occasionally to check and make sure she doesn't toss away anything I want to keep. (I want to keep a lot of things).

Last weekend Globe told me my rewards point were expiring so I cashed them in for some Grab vouchers (after some struggling with the terrible GlobeOne app). So this week I found myself ordering GrabFood a couple of times to start making the most of the vouchers.

The weather continues to be very hot during most of the day, making my walking endeavors challenging.

On the blog: [Movie/TV reviews for Feb and Mar](/2024/04/movies-tv-feb-mar-2024/), [the 2024 site update](/2024/04/2024-site-update/), and reviews for [Tales of Arise](/2024/04/tales-of-arise/) and [Interesting Times](/2024/04/interesting-times/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finished **Tales of Arise**, review linked above. Thinking of taking a short break from RPGs, at least until Eiyuden Chronicles comes out in a couple of weeks. and am working on post-game stuff. Finally finished a War in Heaven in **Stellaris**! (It ended in Status Quo.)
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Mostly wrapped up with MKM drafting, so I will write my set recap post soonish, as the next set drops next next week I think.

- **Reading**: Tried to re-kickstart my book reading (haven't read a book since January), so I started with a short one, predictably a Discworld book. Finished reading **Interesting Times** (review linked above). Comics-wise, mostly finished with my Guardians of the Galaxy runs, just need to go through some one-shots and annuals.

- **Watching**: No new movies watched this week. Finished watching the back half of Invincible S2. Shogun and X-Men 97 still ongoing (and still very good). Final season of Discovery has also started but I haven't gotten into it yet.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,237 steps. I might be busy on some days this coming week, so I suspect I will not hit the target next time.

### Website Changes

2024 site redesign is up! Or at the first part is at the very least. There's still a lot of other stuff to do. Details linked above.

### Some Links of Interest

Last few weeks have been sparse. Consequently, my feed reader backlog has gotten a bit long and I have saved so many links that look interesting. 

- [Cap Watkins – The Sliding Scale of Giving a Fuck](https://capwatkins.com/blog/the-sliding-scale-of-giving-a-fuck)

    > "Similarly, if I'm a ten-out-of-ten on every single decision I'm ever a part of, how can anyone know or trust me when I say something's very important to me? Having an internal barometer for what's important and what's less critical is incredibly useful for helping others trust your responses to ideas and proposals."

    Good to keep in mind; I sometimes (often?) find myself going all out on topics or discussions that I don't actually care too much about.

    (TW:Medium) Long, rambling, highly opinionated post about leadership failures, short-term thinking, Boeing, Warner Bros, Disney, Valve, etc

    > "Similar to smartphones, gaming consoles are polished, user-friendly, walled gardens that guide you down a pre-destined path. Gaming on computers are more like “the web.” Open. Expansive. Chaotic."

    I still love consoles, but only for games I couldn't otherwise play on PC.

    Re: open source maintenance. Post is from Dec 2022, but seems relevant in light of the recent xz issue.

### This Coming Week

- a balikbayan friend is in town and that usually means we get together for boardgames and such, so might have a few such days in the coming two weeks or so.
- I think new Fallout series drops on Prime Video this week.
