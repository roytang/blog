title: Weeknotes 2024-04-14 Spring Cleaning
---

### The world

Iran launched a drone attack on Israel. Trump's first criminal trial begins this coming week. The weather continues to be punishingly harsh.

### My Week

My week was exhausting, mostly because I was out of the house for most days, disrupting my regular routines. Tuesday and Wednesday were holidays over here, but that didn't really matter.

A friend from the US is back in town, and our usual activities involve getting together to play boardgames and other stuff while he's here and this time we're attempting to finish another [Arkham Horror LCG](/2023/04/arkham-horror-lcg/) campaign over the course of his two week visit and it is kind of a punishing schedule, especially since this new one seems tougher than the last campaign we played and we ended up having to redo the first scenario TWICE. We did manage to finish the first four scenarios over the week, so we will probably take a couple of days next week to try to finish the other half of the campaign.

Household spring cleaning is still going strong, and I have begrudingly agreed to go through some old computer stuff to see which ones cold be thrown out. We ended up tossing a very old laptop, an old printer (I had no way to even test if it still worked since it had no ink!), a couple of old monitors (it's possible one of the still worked, but I still had two other less-older extra monitors hanging around so I just agreed to let them go), and a LOT of mice, speakers, cables, etc. I like going through old junk, but throwing them out not so much.

Later in the week we visited with one of my brothers and their storage room was much more crammed than our extra room and I was like, see, we didn't really need to throw out so much stuff!

Thursday night we attended [quiz night at a new venue](/2024/04/don-conejos-jason-quiz/). 

Spent most of Saturday travelling to and from the south side of the Metro to visit with mother's side relatives. It is so far away and we had to take a Grab both ways which turned out really expensive. Good to see that side of the family again though (a rare occurence since the pandemic), lots of catching up and stories about the olden days, Canada, and all of us getting older.

On the blog: I rambled on about [the neighborhood](/2024/04/neighborhood/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Mostly just playing **Stellaris** when I can. Started a new run, trying to play tall and with a federation.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Had to miss a bunch of daily quests in Arena since I was out of the house most of the time.
  
- **Reading**: Not a lot this week, a few comics here and there maybe.

- **Watching**: No new movies watched this week. A bit behind on most shows, but I took the time to catch up on X-Men '97 because I heard episode was a doozy (it was!). This past weekend was Wrestlemania weekend, but for some reason Disney+ did not retain the shows after they live-streamed them, so I have not seen this year's Wrestlemania (yet?)

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 63,883 steps. I am frankly amazed I managed to hit 6 out of 7 days at all, so I'll count this as a win.

### Website Changes

Did some minor tweaks to the new site design after someone complained.

### Some Links of Interest

Didn't have a lot of time for the internet this week, so not a lot to share. The feed reader backlog grows.

- [NYC Chicken Shop Replaces Cashier With Woman in Philippines On Zoom](https://www.404media.co/sansan-chicken-zoom-cashier/)

    That is... certainly something. Pinoy pride! Wut
