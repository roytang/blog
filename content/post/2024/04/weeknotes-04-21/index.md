### The world

Trump's criminal trial is proceeding apace, finishing jury selection just as a man chose to immolate himself outside the courthouse. The whole Iran / Israel conflict has not yet escalated... so far. Bitcoin halving is done! Tesla had to recall all their cybertrucks! OJ Simpson has died.

[Post.news is shutting down](https://post.news/@/noam/2fJw4PYRFjya343RpiToiyEQr0x). Post was one of the erstwhile Twitter clones that popped up after Musk started to kill it. I don't really use it but I think I have an account because I occasionally receive an email titled "Weekly Post roundup" or something like that, which I actually found a bit useful for reminding me about things that have happened during the week.

### My Week

This week was another exhausting one, as I was out and about most days. Things to attend to included prep for the next immunotherapy session, an optha appointment, meeting up with relatives who were about to fly back to the US, finishing up the boardgame sessions with friends. Thursday night we attended [a comedy-themed quiz night](/2024/04/popquiz-comedy/). 

The weather continues to be punishingly hot, especially since I was moving about during the day. I may or may not have used the term "sea of fire" to describe my commute to a friend's house. 

Given I was out of the house a lot, I don't really have a lot to write about today. I did manage to roam some old haunts in between all these things I had to do, but that isn't really of interest. Well, there are some stories to be told, but probably deserving of their own blog posts.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still just mostly just playing **Stellaris** when I can. Started a new run, trying to play tall and with a federation.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Have not had much time but managed to sneak in a couple of Outlaws of Thunder Junction drafts over the past couple of days. They have not gone well. I did manage to hit [infinite in Marvel Snap](https://roytang.net/2024/04/112290970255509124/) for the 3rd time though!
    - Been playing [some boardgames with friends](/2024/04/thunder-road-innsmouth/) over the past couple of weeks!
  
- **Reading**: Not a lot this week, a few comics here and there maybe. I have fallen behind on my reading targets.

- **Watching**: Nothing of note. Keeping up with the ongoing TV series though. Shogun continues to be excellent and I am very much looking forward to the finale next week. And there are a bunch I want to start! So many things to watch.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 60,500 steps. Almost a whole day off the usual target, but I'm good with that given how busy the week is. Actually it gives me a bit of confidence that even if I returned to a full time working schedule, I could maybe possibly still maintain this walking pace?

### Website Changes

Not much on the frontend.

Ugh, server resource consumption has been spiking again recently, had to ban another AI bot user agent this morning. 

### Some Links of Interest

- [I pray you're born with gills](https://www.10yearstosavetheworld.com/comics/ren-galeno)

    A comic about climate change anxiety

- [Scrabble: Mattel launches new version of game which is 'less competitive'](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-68769981)

    As someone who used to kinda play Scrabble competitively this is sooo not my preference, but I understand the need to make things more accessible for people of different temperaments

- [Making version noir](https://anhvn.com/posts/2024/making-version-noir/)

    I liked this discussion of how a new homepage design was made, especially the part about making the comics responsive

- [We Need To Rewild The Internet](https://www.noemamag.com/we-need-to-rewild-the-internet/)

    > "Our online spaces are not ecosystems, though tech firms love that word. They’re plantations; highly concentrated and controlled environments … that madden the creatures trapped within."

### This Coming Week

- Being out of the house so often has generally meant falling behind on my usual routines; I am looking forward to a lighter week that lets me catch up on things I have missed
- Immunotherapy session #6 tomorrow
- We are probably attending another quiz night on Thursday
