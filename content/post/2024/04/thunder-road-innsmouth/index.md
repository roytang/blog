Our friend from the US was back in town again for a couple of weeks, and that meant getting together and playing some tabletop games he brought along.

### Thunder Road Vendetta

Our main plan was to play another campaign of Arkham Horror LCG, which [we first played last year](/2023/06/boardgames/), but our fourth party member was a bit late to the first meeting, so first we decided to play **Thunder Road Vendetta**. It is a post-apocalyptic death race game where teams of cars race across a field full of obstacles and car wrecks and slam into other cars trying to be the first across the finish line. My aggro strategy to race ahead backfired when my two opponents conspired to take out all my cars early, so sad. Despite that, the game is fun and each turn typically involves cars slamming into each other multiple times, sometimes fatally.

### Arkham Horror LCG: The Innsmouth Conspiracy

Once the party was complete, we all chose decks and strapped in for another 8-scenario **Arkham Horror LCG** campaign. This time we were running through *The Innsmouth Conspiracy*. I played a bookish clue-getting-type of person last time so this time I chose Tony Morgan, whose focus is on combat using guns and switchblades. Basically taking out the bad guys to keep the other investigators alive while they figure all this nonsense out.

Our run started out terribly as we had to start over the first scenario TWICE. Technically we could have kept going, but we preferred to restart while early in the campaign. That took most of our entire first day!

We did a bit better on the second day, powering through scenarios 2-4, though we actually failed the objective in one of the scenarios (it was a murder mystery and we basically accused the wrong suspect because we ran out of time!). Day three was again very challenging, Tony Morgan died in both scenarios 5 and 6, accumulating trauma, but giving his companions time to escape.

The final day with two scenarios was incredibly close, especially scenario 7, which went down the wire! With the agenda deck advancing at the top of the turn, we had one chance to fulfill the scenario objectives and our clue-getting person needed to hit all his investigate attempts to get us there. But he used all his pumps and on the final roll we needed to pull a +0 or better to survive, with multiple curse tokens in the bag. If you've played the game you know these were really bad odds! They passed the bag to me to make this high-pressure roll, and surprisingly I managed to pull the blue star token, guaranteeing victory. It was an epic moment. Final scenario was not as epic, but I enjoyed the idea of Tony Morgan staring two huge ancient onces in the face to keep them occupied as his companions disrupted the dark ritual to win the scenario.

All in all it took us four whole days of playing to finish the campaign! And our US friend was only in town for two weeks this time, so our schedule was super cramped (last year we had a few months to finish the Carcosa campaign). Luckily our schedules were relatively free and there were holidays during this period. The scenarios all felt very difficult; I think the last campaign also felt about the same level of difficulty, but this time we took a lot more time, maybe 3-4 hours per scenario and often going down the wire with the agenda deck. Overall the game remains very exciting and nerve-wracking and probably still best played a scenario at a time over months instead of our crammed schedule!
