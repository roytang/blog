I finished **Tales of Arise** earlier today! I played the [very short PS4 Tales of Arise demo in 2021](/2022/01/playstation-wrapup-2021/#_) and I was planning to get it after beating **Tales of Xillia 2** on PS3 first but never got around to that game. *Arise* came out for PC Game Pass in late February, so I finally got a chance to play it and it took me around a month and a half. This is a fairly good pace; the last Tales game I played was [Tales of Vesperia](/2022/05/tales-of-vesperia/) in 2022 and that took me around 4 months! 

### Quick Review

Quick review: I enjoyed the combat, but the story is full of anime tropes, which is typcal for a [Tales series](/tags/talesof/) game anyway.

I remember thinking about halfway through that the combat may be the best the Tales series has ever had, but towards the end my opinion of it has tapered off a bit. Later battles felt a bit repetitive and too straightforward and there wasn't a lot of late game challenge. (A lot more of my deaths were due to misjudging enemy levels in the mid-game.) I think I played the game on the default difficulty (whatever that is). That being said, I still largely enjoyed the combat. I liked those team-up attacks they do.

Story-wise: Kinda middling, nothing too exceptional, perhaps a bit too "we are fated to be together" at some points, but that's anime for you. The whole long-term plot revealed later in the game seems unnecessarily complicated and I suspect it wouldn't hold up if I looked into it more closely.

### Character breakdown

- Alphen: Most used character. Unsurprising because he's the lead but he's also the most versatile combat-wise, good mobility, has some range attacks and good air combo possibilities.
- Rinwell: Second most used character. Easy to use point-and-shoot magic user. Most useful Boost Attack. I like her as a character but disliked her character design, so I had her dressed as a farmer for most of the second half of the game lol. Maybe my favorite character.
- Law: Distant third most used character. He's kind of a less versatile Alphen, he doesn't really have any long range attacks and even his melee attacks feel like they don't have any range/AoE. When he's first introduced I kind of thought he would be a cunning plotter type character, but he turned out to be a kind of dense insensitive idiot lol.
- Shionne: Primary healer. Didn't use much. Her range attacks are fine, but her bomb attacks are a bit challenging to use because I think you have to be at a specific range? Kind of annoyed by her voice. Typical tsundere protagonist who softens up by the end.
- Dohalim: Secondary healer. Introduced as a potential villain, but that hair just tells you he's going to be a party member. I found his physical attacks hard to use as they tend to move him around a lot so chaining them together wasn't straightforward.
- Kisara: Tanky person and team fisherperson. Found her the most challenging to use in combat, very slow and low mobility and low aerial combo potential. Her boost attack could be useful, but the window to activate it effectively is often vanishingly small for my slow reflexes.

### A Video

I streamed the first hour and a half or so of the game a while back:

### Completion

Perhaps in a bid to make the series more accessible, completion was much easier for *Arise* than previous games in the series. None of the achievements are missable, and everything can be done in a single run (making enabling the New Game+ bonuses a bit useless). I hit all 47 of the main game achievements, saving the fishing minigame completion for last because I find fishing minigames dreadfully boring. Thankfully I was able to power through the one here in about an hour.

I did find myself a bit disappointed in the post-game content though. I found the cameo battles kind of boring and uncreative in the choice of cameos. I guess that is the cost of easier completion.

The game pass achievement list includes those for *Beyond the Dawn* DLC, which seems like a decently-sized expansion, but I currently have little interest in getting it.

**Total playtime: Around 64.75 hours**. [How Long To Beat](https://howlongtobeat.com/game/68118) has average completionist runs for this game at around 73.5 hours, so I am ahead of the curve!

### Screenshots

Not a lot of screenshots for this one, especially compared to Vesperia/Symphonia/Berseria. Honestly it's mostly because I find the screenshot hotkey for PC Game Pass games to be so much more cumbersome than the Steam one!

### What's Next

I have had a copy of **Tales of Xillia 2** for PS3 that I've been meaning to play since 2021. *Arise* was the last released Tales games, so hopefully I get around to Xillia 2 before another one comes out! Meanwhile, I believe Eiyuden Chronicles releases on Game Pass later this month, so I might check that out.
