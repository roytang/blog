### Spoiler-free Review

The final episode of FX's **Shogun** miniseries aired today and I watched it as soon as it was available on Disney+. The [original remains one of my favorite books](/2018/11/shogun-and-the-rest-of-james-clavells-asian-saga/), so I had been looking forward to this adaptation and it did not disappoint. While I have my nitpicks here and there and overall I wish the series had been longer and had retained more details from the book, I am generally happy with it as an adaptation and must note the fantastic performances by the main cast. The costuming and set design and everything was generally on point and very immersive. The show had so many great moments as well.

One concern is that people who haven't read the book may have built up some wrong expectations for how the show ends and may find the eventual ending anticlimactic. More on that later!

In addition to watching the show itself, I also listened to the official podcast which gives some BTS details for each episode ([YT playlist here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIDyzBpnfjqnotNeH1fcGvu6K_BfpjBcN)). Aside from giving insights to some of the decisions behind changes in the show, the podcast also gave me a greater appreciation of the historical context and characters upon which the novel was based.

### Spoliery Show Notes

I have been wanting to talk about this show since it started, especially the differences between the book and the show, and I think I'm going to get into some detail. Liberal and unmarked book and show spoilers follow.

The first couple of episodes already had me very impressed, as I felt they were very faithful adaptations of the book's plot, if a bit compressed in terms of timeline, understandably because they only had 10 episodes to work with. While the events of the show generally follow the pace and tone of the book, there are some notable differences:

- a lot of the names, both of places and major characters, have been changed. I understand from the official podcast that many of the changes were made for the sake of historical accuracy, as the many of the names in the book would not have been appropriate for the time period
- in the book, Blackthorne's main task for Toranaga is training a regiment of musket-bearing soldiers. In the show, this is changed to training the regiment in the use of Blackthrone's cannon, which is superior to anything the Japanese had ever seen before. Again from the official podcast, this is because historically the Japanese had already been using firearms for at least 70 years, so training a musket regiment didn't make sense
- the book has a lot of internal dialogue, the sort of thing that doesn't really translate well to a visual adaptation. They sort of work around this a bit, but overall I felt like a lot of detail and nuance in the characters' decisions was lost due to being unable to expound on their motivations via internal dialogue.

#### Blackthorne

- the show shifts Blackthorne's character arc significantly, in a way de-emphasizing his relationship with Mariko. In the show Blackthrone and Mariko are only "together" a couple of times, despite how close they are. In the book, their affair goes on for a long time and they have a lot more open, intimate conversations discussing their relationship. In the book, Blackthorne's primary motivation for the second half of the book is primarily to protect Mariko and hence he was loyal to Toranaga. Show Blackthorne is much more useless in the second half of the show and attempts to find his own path separately from Toranaga.
- I was also surprised that they cut Blackthorne's sepukku attempt in Anjiro when Yabu threatens to punish the villagers. This whole subplot of requiring the villagers to help him learn Japanese does not exist in the show and it felt like they cut out an important part of Blackthorne's charater arc since it was that point that book Blackthorne began to understand the Japanese perspective on life and death
- Instead, the sepukku attempt happens in the very last episode and Blackthorne's whole character arc was shifted to end here with his "rebirth" and acceptance of everything he has lost and his fate in Japan. Having Toranaga himself quickly step in to save him was a nice touch, though I wish he hed acknowledged Blackthorne's chutzpah a bit and not just suddenly smack him around with the idea to build a new ship and fleet, which kind of came out of nowhere. I wish they had instead kept that part of the book where Mariko left a letter behind for Blackthorne, giving him the idea of building a new ship; I think it would have given Blackthorne more closure.
- Cosmo Jarvis gave an excellent performance here, playing the fish out of water trying to make the best of his situation very well.
- Also, they kind of butchered the context of my favorite Anjin quote! (See below)

#### Toranaga

{{% photos toranaga %}}

- I feel like the inability to use internal dialogue has affected the character of Toranaga the most. Show Toranaga (played masterfully by Hiroyuki Sanada) feels a lot more serious and constantly with a grim expression on his face, coldly making all his decisions. Book Toranaga felt more like a full person, since we read about all the things and plans he considers, and all of his internal joys and turmoils. Book Toranaga is often internally so excited and joyful when he gets new information that could help his cause, while show Toranaga can only show the outer stoicness required of him.
- I was worried about how they would handle the book's second "climax": Toranaga's internal monologue where he admits to sacrificing *Erasmus* and manipulating Blackthorne and Mariko and everyone else and that he had been plotting to become Shogun all along. The show works around this by having Toranaga be Yabu's second at his sepukku, allowing him to admit all his plans and monologue to Yabu, just as a classic Bond villain would!
- Without the internal monologue, show Toranaga also feels less hyper-competent compared to book Toranaga; events like Naga's surprise death make it seem like he's simply getting lucky and stumbling along instead of taking advantage of long-running machinations bearing fruit. In the book, I believe he machinated Sugiyama's defection from the council instead of it happening independently of him.

#### Mariko

- In many ways, Mariko is a more important character to the book and the show than Blackthorne, and sometimes even Toranaga himself. Aside from cutting back her relationship with Blackthorne, show Mariko retains all of the depth and background of the character, losing very little in the adaptation, and in fact getting additional backstory as she is revealed to have been childhood friends with Ochiba, a relationship that was not in the book.
- Mariko is involved in some of the most tension-filled scenes in the show, and not just the action-y ones (though she gets those too!). I easily predicted that the climax of her character arc, and arguably the main climax of the book itself, would happen in episode 9: her attempt to free the hostages from Osaka castle and sepukku attempt and the subsequent shinobi attack. Everything that comes after is simply tying up lose ends. The show acknowledges this when Toranaga says that's what Crimson Sky actually was - Mariko prying open Osaka castle - and not the grand war plan that the book describes.
- Anna Sawai easily gives the best performance in the entire show, perhaps an award-winning performance even.

#### Yabushige

{{% photos yabu %}}

- If Mariko was the character who had retained most of her depth from the book, Yabushige (or Yabu, as I still refer to him in my head) is arguably the breakout star and most improved character from the book. The scheming, treacherous, and self-serving lord was already an interesting character in the book but the show and Tadanobu Asano's portrayal gave the character even more idiosyncrasies like putting together a book on the best death and making outrageous statements constantly being befuddled and surprised by the show's events and the nonverbal chemistry between him and Blackthorne is just great. Show Yabu feels a bit less cunning and mean than book Yabu (though still every bit the psychopath), and even provides a bit of comic relief throughout some of the most tense moments of the series. 

#### Other Characters

- Fuji (Fujiko in the book), although mostly a minor character, is also vastly improved from the book, with Moeki Hoshi's quiet reaction faces adding a lot to every scene she's in. The character even gets a different ending in this one, opting to move on from her family's shame to become a nun instead of the implied "accidental" death she is granted in the book.
- Notably missing: Toranaga's eldest son and heir Sudara, whose wife is actually Ochiba's sister in the book. The first episode mentions that Ochiba went to Edo to visit her pregnant sister (Toranaga's daughter-in-law), but she and Sudara are never shown on-screen. Instead, Ochiba's childhood relationship with Mariko is used as a way to expound on her character.
- Hiromatsu and Nagakado surprisingly get killed off where their book equivalents did not. Nagakado's accidental death gives Toranaga time to scheme and is kind of ironic given his dreams of glory, while Hiromatsu's seppuku is a tense moment that takes the place of Toranaga disowning Sudara as the climax of the meeting where trason is discussed. I guess this was appropriate, because their book equivalents weren't actually very relevant to the second half of the book.

#### The ending

As mentioned, some show viewers may be disappointed if they were expecting a big showdown with Ishido in the series finale. During Toranaga's monologue to Yabu he implies what he expects to happen at what will eventually be the battle of Sekigahara, but it was never going to be the sort of show or series that would end with a huge setpiece battle. I do wish that the ending had given us a more solid hint of where Toranaga's story was going, even with a short text blurb at the end (mirroring the short text intro at the start of episode 1). In the book we at least see Toranaga making his initial plans and giving out orders for the first skirmishes of the coming war and how he plans to deal with the regents, and we get the short blurb at the end describing what happens when he and Ishido eventually meet on the field. 

That being said, the rest of the ending was pretty good, with callbacks to earlier episodes and giving good conclusions for each of the major characters (and even some minor ones), even giving us a fake-out in Blackthorne's "flash forward" dream sequences.

#### That's It

I have already written way too many words about this show! I honestly held back from commenting on the many excellent scenes and details otherwise this post might never have gotten done!
