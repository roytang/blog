title: 'Books: Interesting Times by Terry Pratchett (Discworld #17)'
---

Finished reading *Interesting Times*, Discworld book #17. This book focuses on Rincewind and his adventures while accidentally fomenting revolution in the Agatean Empire, the Discworld analogue to China.

There are actually two halves of the plot here; in addition to Rincewind as the revolutionary Great Wizzard, we also see the return of Cohen the Barbarian as he and his elderly motley crew also attempt to overthrow the Agatean Empire (and maybe attempt to understand a bit of civilization along the way).

My favorite thing about this book is Rincewind's reunion with Twoflower - a character last seen in the first two Discworld books and never heard from again, until this one. It's been so long since I read *The Colour of Magic* and *The Light Fantastic* that I have no record of when I actually read them (I'm sure it was when I was already working so probably the early 2000s). I actually heard of the name "Twoflower" before ever reading a Discworld book, as there was a fanfic author using that nickname back in the 90s.

This was pretty good as far as Rincewind books go, even though Rincewind himself is often the least interesting character in the books as he has a one-track mind of just running away from everything but getting into hijinx anyway.

This brings us to [21/41 Discworld](/page/discworld/) books read! Halfway through!
