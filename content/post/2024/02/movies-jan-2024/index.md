#### 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003)

Watched on 2024-01-02: ★★★½



{{% photos 2-fast-2-furious-2003 %}} For some reason I found this more enjoyable than the first one, despite still knowing nothing about cars and racing. Maybe having a clear-cut villain was more interesting? Was also surprised at no Vin Diesel in this one, since it feels like the later films are all about him. LOLed at the cutting edge early-2000s cgi

#### The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006)

Watched on 2024-01-04: ★★★½



{{% photos the-fast-and-the-furious-tokyo-drift-2006 %}} Glad to see the series tackle street racing culture outside of the US. Surprised to see a completely different lead in this one. Always happy to watch things set in Tokyo. That final race was intense, though it felt a bit silly that the audience was following through those tiny flip phones

(I still don't know anything about cars)



---

#### Fast & Furious (2009)

Watched on 2024-01-05: ★★★



{{% photos fast-furious-2009 %}} Action set pieces are still on point, but the plot here felt a bit contrived to be able to bring Dom and Brian on the same page, with a twist you could see coming. Oh and also not sure if I just wasn't paying enough attention, but there was a part here about a fingerprint lookup that didn't make sense?!?



---

#### Fast Five (2011)

Watched on 2024-01-10: ★★★½



{{% photos fast-five-2011 %}} The Rock has joined the franchise! I enjoyed the ensemble cast coming together (but how is Han alive?!? And that other person?!?) and the stunts and action set pieces were good as usual, though I suspect there are some laws of physics being violated in there somewhere. It helps my suspension of disbelief that I don't know much about driving - but the film never takes itself too seriously anyway. I also liked the transition from a street racing focus to a heist focus, as I generally enjoy heist films more.



---

#### Fast & Furious 6 (2013)

Watched on 2024-01-11: ★★★½



{{% photos fast-furious-6-2013 %}} Found this one a bit boring compared to the last one, at least until the final set of action set pieces at the end of the film. And ok, the tank reveal was fun. Still need to suspend a lot of disbelief! Tanks can't go that fast! This can't happen before Tokyo Drift, they still had flip phones there, this timeline makes no sense! And the weird height perspective scene between The Rock and Vin Diesel is here lol. I will admit to being entertained though, so maybe that's enough.



---

#### Furious 7 (2015)

Watched on 2024-01-13: ★★★½



{{% photos furious-7-2015 %}} "I think we went past ridiculous 3 or 4 movies ago."

Sooo many over the top stunts! Still fun to watch, as long as you try not to make too much sense of everything.

Feels like Dom accepting the whole God's Eye plan was unnecessary, Shaw wasn't hard to find, he kept coming at them. Deckard Shaw acts much more like a blunt instrument compared to his brother.

I kind of assumed they would kill off Brian due to Paul Walker's death, but apparently not? I suppose I'll see what happens to him in the next film. His face looks a bit weird in some of his scenes here, probably because they just cgi'ed him onto the standins.



---

#### Kung Fu Panda 3 (2016)

Watched on 2024-01-13: ★★★★



{{% photos kung-fu-panda-3-2016 %}} After seeing the Kung Fu Panda 4, I realized I've never seen this one, luckily it was on Prime Video.

A fun little adventure, if a bit predictable. I can only sympathize with Tigress' exasperation at how silly it all is lol. JK Simmons played a great villain and Bryan Cranston was great as Po's dad, and the rest of the pandas were a fun addition as well. It's nice that the story filled out Po's origin story and at the same time explained why Oogway made that choice in the first movie in the first place.



---

#### The Fate of the Furious (2017)

Watched on 2024-01-16: ★★★



{{% photos the-fate-of-the-furious-2017 %}} Plot was kind of weird, because Dom reacting to the blackmail/hostage situation felt a bit out of character; felt like he would have gone against Cipher guns blazing instead. Then again, we are well past the point of ridiculousness here.

There is still a lot of spectacle and action sequences to enjoy and I liked how they brought the Shaws into the fold somehow, but this one felt like a bit of a step down from the last 2 movies.



---

#### F9 (2021)

Watched on 2024-01-18: ★★★



{{% photos f9-2021 %}} It feels like they start development of each film in this franchise with "what ridiculous things can we do to top the ridiculous things from the last film?" I had more than enough "WHAT THE HECK" moments in the first 20 minutes alone and the third act was much more insane.

I like how Roman acts like the audience surrogate who understands how ridiculous everything is and even calls out their plot armor. 

Also, I would have had Vin Diesel and John Cena play their younger selves as well, that would have been hilarious.

Still quite entertaining, as long as you're not expecting anything sensible!



---

#### The Equalizer 2 (2018)

Watched on 2024-01-20: ★★★½



{{% photos the-equalizer-2-2018 %}} Entertaining movie, but maybe a bit worse than the first one. Actual bad guy identity was kinda predictable, and their end game plan was stupid; they had the kid, why go to where McCall was and not just make him come to you?

Really good kills though.



---

#### The Equalizer 3 (2023)

Watched on 2024-01-21: ★★★½



{{% photos the-equalizer-3-2023 %}} This one felt closer in tone to the first movie: long stretches of slow, even idyllic, buildup interrupted by sudden action sequences punctuated by brutal kill scenes. For some reason (only explained much later in the movie), our protagonist finds himself wandering around Sicily and enjoying the lazy Italian country life.

I like all the scenes where Washington and Fanning interact; the last time they were in a movie together in 2004's Man on Fire, Fanning was just a little kid!

There was a scene here where the baddies were plotting their revenge while eating some spaghetti and that spaghetti looked really good and made me crave spaghetti.

My one complaint about this movie/series is that McCall is a bit too indestructible. One feels very little concern that he might lose to the bad guys, so it feels like the stakes are low and the consequences, if any, are likely to be born by the innocents around him instead.



---

#### Fast X (2023)

Watched on 2024-01-22: ★★★



{{% photos fast-x-2023 %}} I came into this one not knowing it's a 2-parter and I was super worried when there were 20 mins remaining and so many things were still left to be resolved.

This is the second 2023 movie I've seen that has someone driving a car down those steps in Rome.

Still some pretty good action and set pieces in here (to be expected), my current favorite happens early on off a bridge in Rome.

It's probably a good idea to be wrapping up this series soon. The ensemble cast for this series has gotten so big each person only gets one or two real action scenes. Somehow Dom's kid had a different set of mixed ethnicities than he did in F9.

Jason Momoa plays an excellent villain. A lot of the plot still doesn't make sense though.



---

#### Star Trek Beyond (2016)

Watched on 2024-01-23: ★★★½



{{% photos star-trek-beyond-2016 %}} This was a fun one; lots of action and nice small character moments. Feels like an extended version of one of the modern series actually.

It's too bad we're not likely to get another movie in the Kelvin timeline with this crew. I kind of missed this cast, they're actually pretty fun together. I particularly liked Simon Pegg's Scotty, must be the accent. I didn't realize the bad guy was Idris Elba until later on!



---

#### Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023)

Watched on 2024-01-27: ★★★



{{% photos aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-2023 %}} This was... fine? It feels a bit like a mediocre second film in the vein of Dark World or Iron Man 2. It's basically a buddy cop movie between Arthur and Orm, and a bit of a redemption arc for the latter. Some fun moments here and there, but the plot is kinda predictable. I always enjoy Randall Park making an appearance as normal human who is in way over his head though.



---

#### The A-Team (2010)

Watched on 2024-01-31: ★★★



{{% photos the-a-team-2010 %}} This was fine, kind of an ok action movie with a plot that was a bit confusing (not sure if even the bad guys knew who betrayed who). I liked the callbacks to the 80s TV series; I don't remember a lot about it but I do remember they did constantly have to knock BA out to get him on a plane!
