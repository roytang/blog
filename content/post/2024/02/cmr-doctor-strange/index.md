### Previously

This is the part 7 [^1] in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED**. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run). This one is all about Doctor Strange.

*(Note: All volume nos. are based on [the Wikipedia listings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(D-E))*, except where they don't make sense [^2])

Note: This entry is quite long, you can use the TOC to navigate.

Similar to the Daredevil installment, I will cover all the Doctor Strange series that have been finished, up to the present day. Unlike Daredevil however, Doctor Strange has never had a truly continuous long-running series of his own. A lot of the character's history happens in anthology titles like *Strange Tales*, *Marvel Feature*, and *Marvel Premiere*, or team books like *Defenders* or the 2000s *Avengers* books. I will not cover any of those here, focusing only on Doctor Strange-specific titles. (This is actually kind of annoying, as many of the character's more well-known villains/supporting cast are first introduced in these anthology series.)

### 1960s

First appearance: *Strange Tales v1 #110 (1963)*.

#### Doctor Strange v1

- *Doctor Strange v1 #169-183 (numbering continued from Strange Tales v1)*
 
*Strange Tales* transitioned to a Doctor Strange solo book with #169 but it didn't last very long. Volume 1 was trippy and briefly introduced a weird "masked superhero" version and also a different secret identity. It didn't last very long either. Lots of dealing with Dormammu and Eternity. During this period, the Ancient One is still alive, and Strange's title is "Master of the Mystic Arts".

### 1970s-1980s

#### Doctor Strange v2

- *Doctor Strange v2 #1-#81*
- *Doctor Strange v2 Annual #1*

Volume 2 came a few years later and was a much more solid volume and the second-longest run Doctor Strange has ever had. Strange starts this volume already the Sorcerer Supreme. (The Ancient One died and passed the title to him in Marvel Premiere). This volume probably featured Strange at the peak of his powers (kind of a "precrisis Superman" equivalent), with him regularly wiping many people's memories with ease and restoring things to how they were and sometimes even travelling through time. He still kept his identity secret, which often necessitated some of the above tricks. Of note is probably his most powerful action in this volume: he rid the Marvel Universe of vampirism. (Presumably forever, but of course this was later reversed.). This volume ends on a cliffhanger as the Sanctum Sanctorum is heavily damaged and all of Strange's mystical artifacts were stolen.

#### Limited Series, One-shots, OGNs

- *Doctor Strange: Into Shamballa (1986)*: A graphic novel by JM DeMatteis and Dan Green. This is a very stylized comicbook, with little dialogue and mostly narrative with a hand-painted aesthetic. Not really a superhero story, more of a mysticism one.
- *Doctor Strange & Doctor Doom: Triumph and Torment (1989)*: This graphic novel by Roger Stern and Mike Mignola sees Strange prove his worthiness of the title Sorcerer Supreme before the Vishanti, and afterwards he commits to helping Doom free his mother's soul from Mephisto. I liked this one, maybe because I like Doom as a comics character.
  
### 1990s

#### Doctor Strange Sorcerer Supreme

- *Doctor Strange Sorcerer Supreme #1-90*
- *Doctor Strange Srocerer Supreme Annual #1-4*

This volume started out pretty good and the first half was generally in the same vein as Volume 2. The second half kind of took a turn for the worse. First, Doctor Strange refused to fight a war on behalf of the Vishanti and because of this he lost the ability to invoke most of his regular spells and he had to explore different sources of magic. He also got involved with the Midnight Sons, a Marvel grouping in the 90s revolving around supernatural characers; I remember reading about it in ads back in the day. 

Since this volume took place mostly in the 90s, this included a number of crossovers with the "Infinity Saga" trilogy of events (Gauntlet/War/Crusade) where Doctor Strange often had a big role.

The worst part was when after a battle with an extradimensional foe, Strange had to hide himself off in a hidden sanctum and was unable to leave. To continue his outside world adventures, he created two magical construct: one was named simply "Strange" and looked like an edgy 90s version of his old "superhero" version from v1; the other was Vincent Stevens, a businessman who invested in "technomagick". During this time he also had a falling out with Wong over Strange's failure to save Wong's fiance. 

This part was a drag to get through and Strange eventually had to handle the two "Strangers" himself. The "Strange" version was merged with a character from the Dark Dimension to help Clea in her war against Dormammu. That subplot was prompty dropped when Warren Ellis did a few issues late into the run, where it was revealed that Doctor Strange eventually agreed to fight in the Vishanti's war and thus regained his normal powers.

The volume kind of ended abruptly with #90 in 1996, I suspect it was cancelled. The whole later half of the volume felt like Marvel not knowing what to do with the character and trying out different things to see what would stick. I suspect Doctor Strange was always a challenge to write because he was so powerful. Strange would not have another solo ongoing series until 2015!

#### Limited Series, One-shots, OGNs

- *Spider-Man/Dr. Strange: The Way to Dusty Death (1992)*: I was hoping this would be a fun Spider-Man romp, but it was a kind of way too serious and kinda sad follow-up to some earlier crossover stories they had involving the Death Dimension
- *Strange Tales v3 #1 (1994)*: Okay, this one was kind of an anthology book, but I decided to include it anyway because it's a one shot. In this book, Doctor Strange assists The Human Torch and The Thing and their Native American friend Wyatt Wingfoot with an ancient demon manifestation. Kind of appropriate casting since those three heroes shared a lot of Strange Tales v1 issues. The book overall has kind of an eerie, horror movie feel.
- *Doctor Strange v3: The Flight of Bones #1-4 (1999)*: This Marvel Knights limited series (which Wikipedia counts as v3 for some reason) has Strange investigating some kind of cult that turns out to be Dormammu machinations. It's always Dormammu! This was kinda meh.
- *Dr. Strange: What Is It That Disturbs You, Stephen? (1997)*: This is a retelling of the story from the first Doctor Strange annual and I had a very weird sense of deja vu while reading it. The names of the related characters and locations have been changed, and I'm not sure if both stories are canon (which means Strange must have had some deja vu himself!)

### 2000s

#### Limited Series, One-shots, OGNs

- *Strange #1-6 (2004)*: This one is a retelling of Strange's origin story by Straczynski. Wikipedia lists this in the character's publication history, but it's actually an alt universe version; while reading it I was wondering why Wong and Clea were so different!
- *Doctor Strange: The Oath #1-5 (2006)*: A limited series by Brian K Vaughn. This one is pretty good and involves Doctor Strange investigating one of the worst villains from the real world: the pharmaceutical industry! Also I believe this series has the one and only time he Stephen Strange has been involved with the Night Nurse.
- *Strange v2 #1-4 (2010)*: A limited series by Mark Waid. In this series he meets a young woman named Casey Kinmont who kind of becomes his apprentice, but the series ends in tragedy as Casey's soul is captured by an otherworldly demon. Waid would later revisit this hanging thread in the 2018 series.
- *Mystic Hands of Doctor Strange (2010)*: This was a black and white collection of four short stories. The stories were okay, but not very deep and the black and white format was not that appealing.

### 2010s-2020s

#### Doctor Strange v4

- Doctor Strange #1-26, 1.MU, #381-390 (2015) 
- Doctor Strange v4 Annual #1
- Doctor Strange: Last Days of Magic 
- Doctor Strange: Damnation #1-4
- Damnation: Johnny Blaze - Ghost Rider #1

I think vol 4 was the first one where I started following Doctor Strange regularly as the comics came out. I didn't remember too many of the details though, the re-read helped!

##### Jason Aaron

The first half of this volume was by Jason Aaron, with Chris Bachalo as his primary artist. I'm a big fan of Bachalo's quirky style and he seems perfect for Doctor Strange!

Aaron starts the volume off with a storyline that lays out how Doctor Strange's use of magic actually works, and at the same time adding a bit of a limiter to his previously overpowered abilities: Every time Strange casts a spell there is a price to be paid, and often that price comes in the form of unimaginable pain or misery or changes to his own body (he can no longer enjoy normal Earth food for example). Strange finds some ways to mitigate or get around this, but no matter what the price has to be paid.

The second story arc is the one I remembered the most from this volume: The Last Days of Magic. In this story arc, Doctor Strange and the rest of the Earth's magic-users face the threat of the Empirikul, a science-based dimension-hopping cult determined to excise magic from all the worlds. Strange eventually manages to defeat them, but at great cost: the amount of magic in the world is almost completely drained and for the foreseeable future, Strange finds himself reliant on his own physical skills (he wields an axe for a good amount of time) and whatever scraps of magic or mystical items he can still find.

Notable introduction by Jason Aaron in this volume is the character of Zelma Stanton, a librarian who eventually becomes Doctor Strange's apprentice (and whom he eventually pisses off like he usually does.)

##### Donny Cates

After Jason Aaron's run ended he turned the reins over to Donny Cates, who largely presided over crossover stuff. 

The first major story arc for Donny Cates involved Loki somehow becoming Sorcerer Supreme and Strange retiring to become a vet. Strange eventually regains his mantle, but along the way Loki accidentally kills a dog Strange had enchanted with the ability to talk, and as an apology brings him back as a talking ghost dog named Bats, who would become Strange's companion up to the present day.

After that, Strange spends some time trying to save Manhattan from the Secret Empire crossover. The final story arc of the volume is related to how Las Vegas was destroyed during Secret Empire. With the best of intentions, Doctor Strange does his thing and brings Vegas back, except it turns out Vegas had been in hell and Mephisto had taken residence, and he was brought back with the rest of it. The Damnation miniseries covered how Strange and his friends were able to defeat Mephisto and install Johnny Blaze as the new ruler of hell. (I'm sure I'll find out more about it when I eventually cover Ghost Rider!)

#### Doctor Strange v5

- Doctor Strange v5 #1-20 (2018)
- Doctor Strange v5 Annual #1
- Dr Strange #1-6

This volume is primarily written by Mark Waid. He starts off with a story arc called "Sorcerer Supreme of the Galaxy", which sees Strange travelling to space in an attempt to rekindle his failing powers. He ends up befriending an alien technomancer named Kanna and they become partners recovering magic artifacts. Waid gives us a look at how magic is viewed elsewhere in the universe (although given that the Empirkul focused on Earth, we can assume most of the magic in the universe came from there).

The rest of the volume sees the short-lived return of Casey (from *Strange v2*), Strange encountering a mysterious accounting agency that tracks the price being paid for magic everywhere (this mystery has never been resolved!), and Strange becoming a Herald of Galactus when the world-eater is sent to the mystic realms and threatens all of reality. That final part ends up with the universe collapsing and Strange needing to reconstruct it all under the supervision of Eternity, and preventing Galactus from being banished from the physical universe in the first place.

Waid ended v5 with a story that saw Strange's injured hands restored to their pristine state. This led to a short series titled "Dr. Strange" with the subtitle "Surgeon Supreme", where he attempted to once again practice medicine, splitting his time with his duties as Sorcerer Supreme. This of course predictably leads to a situation that threatens everyone in the hospital where he works. I don't think he worked at a hospital again after this.

#### Death of Doctor Strange (2021)

- Death of Doctor Strange #1-5
- Death of Doctor Strange: Avengers #1
- Death of Doctor Strange: Blade #1
- Death of Doctor Strange: Bloodstone #1
- Death of Doctor Strange: Spider-Man #1
- Death of Doctor Strange: White Fox #1
- Death of Doctor Strange: X-Men/Black Knight #1
- Strange Academy Presents: Death of Doctor Strange #1

This event marks the beginning of writer Jed McKay's turn with Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange has been murdered! And the only one who can solve his murder is... young Doctor Strange? The associated one-shot books mostly cover the impact of the death of the Sorcerer Supreme without an heir apparent to take over.

#### Strange v3

- Strange v3 #1-10 (2022)

With Strange's murder solved, Clea takes up his mantle as Sorceress Supreme! And her primary goal: to bring Stephen Strange back to the world of the living!

#### Strange Academy 

- Strange Academy: Finals #1-6
- Strange Academy: Miles Morales #1
- Strange Academy: Moon Knight #1
- Strange Academy: Amazing Spider-Man #1

Decided to include this here as it's at the very least Doctor Strange-adjacent. I [read Strange Academy v1 in 2022](/2022/08/iron-man-v1/#other-comics), so I'm not including it in this post's issue count. I didn't really talk about it back then, so: Strange Academy features a magic school (big surprise) where Doctor Strange and other magic users, including Zelma, train younger magic users from across the dimensions. The cast of students is wide and varied, including Asgardians, a Frost Giant, Dormammu's "son", and of course there are also some normal human misfits. It's a fun, high-school themed adventure with some great art by Humberto Ramos.

#### Limited Series, One-shots, OGNs

- *Marvel Vault: Doctor Strange (2011)*: One-shot written by Roger Stern about Stephen Strange's first night at the Sanctum Sanctorum.
- *Doctor Strange Season One (2012)*: A story about Stephen Strange's first mission under the Ancient One's tutelage, alongside Wong with hair!
- *Doctor Strange: Mystic Apprentice (2016)*: Turns out this one is actually an MCU-related story, though it also reprints older stories from Strange Tales.
- *Doctor Strange and the Sorcerers Supreme #1-12 (2016)*: A fun time-travelling romp where Stephen Strange works together with past and future Sorcerer Supremes, with some surprising pulls from history.
- Doctor Strange: The End (2020): This is a "potential future" story where Doctor Strange is the last surviving mystic on Earth, and as he is dying he uses all his remaining resources to bring back his heir to the title Sorcerer Supreme. 
- *Doctor Strange: Nexus of Nightmares (2022)*: Doctor Strange vs Nightmare and Baron Mordo!
- *Doctor Strange: Fall Sunrise #1-4 (2023)*: This was a fantastic and very weird limited series with very trippy visuals (see the sample page below). A lot of people put it on their "best of 2023" comics list.

### We Have Caught Up!

After Strange v3, the latest volume of Doctor Strange by Jed McKay is still ongoing. [^3]

### MCU Comparisons

The biggest notable difference from the MCU version is the existence of Christine Palmer as Stephen Strange's love interest; that character does not exist in the comics at all! While Strange has had multiple love interests his most common love interest is Clea of the Dark Dimension, who was introduced in *Strange Tales v1*. She and Strange were together for almost all of v1, v2 and Sorcerer Supreme; after DSSS ended she was kind of forgotten and just left in the Dark Dimension to deal with Dormammu, I am glad she has been brought back to the fore with McKay's tenure with Strange.

Another big thing is that other Dormammu and Mordo, none of Strange's regular villains have made appearances in the MCU. I felt that Multiverse of Madness was kind of a missed opportunity as they used it to resolve Wanda's storyline and cover multiverse stuff instead of delving deeper into Strange's lore. Up until I was in the theatre, I was hoping the film's villain was secretly Nightmare. They even had a giant tentacled one-eyed monster in there and didn't bother relating it to Shuma-Gorath!

### Panels I Have Saved

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 339

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 41

Total issues covered so far: 3,502 + 339 = 3,841

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30)[^4]: 34,474 (+286 from 2 months ago)

Progress: 11.14% (up by 0.9% from the last post) [^5]

### Up Next

I'm considering covering either of the following next, possibly both:

- Guardians of the Galaxy. Should be another small set; the old series lasted < 100 issue, and the modern GoTG team didn't come together until the late 2000s.
- Heroes Reborn (1990s). I want to do this set because it lets me proceed to the remaining modern Iron Man/Captain America/Thor stories.

These entries continue to be quite long! This one is over 3000 words long. I ask myself if it's really necessary to describe every single series, especially when I'm covering so many in a single post, but I think it's useful for future me as a reference for what happens in these series!

[^1]: Numbering these entries was always a foolish endeavor, much like numbering comics perhaps! But we'll keep it going for a while longer.
[^2]: It's kind of frustrating that Marvel doesn't have a standard volume numbering method. I use Wikipedia as my primary reference for what to read, but it's not even internally consistent; the ["List of Marvel publications" pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(D%E2%80%93E)) will sometimes disagree with [the Publication History section for the specific comic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Strange_(comic_book))! And wikis like Marvel Fandom will sometimes have their own numbering method. The usual differences arise due to Marvel's practice of going back to Legacy Numbering whenever they feel like it! 
[^3]: So far, Daredevil and Doctor Strange are the only characters were I have covered most of their main runs, so for their succeeding series I'll just cover them when they're done, when I can.
[^4]: I have still not found a better reference reading order.
[^5]: Progress still isn't that good, but I suspect when I revisit all of the older series I've already previously read, it will be somewhere in the 40-50% range, optimistically!
