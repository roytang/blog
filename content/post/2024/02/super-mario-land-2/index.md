title: 'Retro Game Review: Super Mario Land 2 (Game Boy)'
---

I never had an actual Game Boy, so I thought I'd try playing some old Game Boy games via Nintendo Switch Online. The first one I tried was **Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins** (IDK why the first Super Mario Land is not available on NSO). This game was Wario's first appearance and he is this game's villain, and Mario must gather the titular 6 Golden Coins to face him. Each of the 6 golden coins is held by a boss in each of 6 "worlds" that you can tackle in any order.

I managed to stream the first three "worlds" of this game:

Overall not super happy with the experience. The controls were a bit weird and the jumps were a bit too floaty and I found it hard to be precise. Something about the way NSO emulates the GB made playing challenging for me - not sure if it was the framerate or the green monochrome palette or what, but I easily got dizzy as I played the game.

I also had to do a controller button config swap because I found it challenging to run and jump in the original button configuration. I put the "B"/run button where the "Y" button normally is and the "A"/jump button where "B" normally is, that way I could hold down run and tap jump with my thumb easily.

I later completed the remaining 3 worlds off-stream; I could only play the game for small bursts at a time before getting dizzy. Each world consists of 3-4 stages and is relatively straightforward and not too challenging. Each stage has multiple paths you can explore to get more coins or 1ups, but I generally found that unnecessary and usually just went for the shortest/easiest path I could fine. 

Each world had a unique "gimmick" and to be fair, a lot of these felt ahead of their time, and it's easy to see elements introduced here that are reused in later Mario games. It only took me a couple of weeks to get through it because I could only play it in short bursts.

Once you have the 6 Golden Coins, you can access the final stage where you face Wario at the end. While the 6 individual worlds were easy, the final stage is insane and bears the hallmarks of the era's "Nintendo Hard" level of difficulty. It's basically a long series of rooms/obstacles with very few recovery powerups and no checkpoint so you need a LOT of lives and practice to get through it in one go. I guess this is where I sort of regretted not getting enough extra coins/lives from the other stages! After struggling with this stage for a week or so (playing only in short bursts), I finally caved and "cheated" by creating and using save points using the NSO emulation layer. I ended up making two save points inside the final stage. Wario himself was a multi-stage boss, but I managed to beat him on the first try. The stage itself was harder!

The game is relatively short; I think each "world" can be done in like 15 mins or so, and then if you had enough lives the final stage can probably be done in like an hour or maybe two.

I'm only giving this one 2/5 stars, mostly because playing it made me dizzy and also because that final stage difficulty spike is ridiculous. TBH it kind of turned me off the idea of trying any of the other available GB games. I later found out however that when playing via the NSO Game Boy emulator you have the option of playing in Game Boy Color mode, and the game looks much better that way compared to the monochrome green palette! (I had been playing in the original Game Boy mode.) So maybe I'll try some of the other titles using GBC mode and see if that's better.
