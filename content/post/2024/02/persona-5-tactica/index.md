title: Persona 5 Tactica
---

The first RPG I finished this year is **Persona 5 Tactica**! I haven't played *Persona 5 Royale*, so this is my first time back with the P5 crew since I finished the original game [way back in 2017](/2017/06/review-persona-5-you-never-saw-it-coming/). *(what, has it really been that long?!?)*

The Phantom Thieves find themselves thrown into a strange version of the Metaverse, where things work a bit differently than they are used to. The art style in this game is a bit different from the original, a lot more super-deformed. I like the aesthetic! As you would expect, a lot of the BGM is pretty good too.

The gameplay is the usual tactical RPG gameplay with some twists. You have 3 party members (and sometimes a guest) and each character can move as much as they want within their move range before they do an action. During your turn, you can freely move around any of your party members and can take their turns in any order you wish, which leads to some interesting puzzle-like scenarios, especially with the later stages where just moving around can activate switches that open doors or move platforms.

The usual elemental strengths and weaknesses mechanics of the main Persona series are gone here, replaced instead by a cover system, where attacking enemies that are out of cover will knock them down and grant you bonus "ONE MORE" actions. Elemental abilities are replaced with different effects; for example, the Wind/"Garu" attacks now always blow enemies away, maybe pushing them out of cover. Electric/"Zio" attacks can cause a Shock status and Ice/"Bufu" attacks cause Freeze status, etc. Surrounding knocked-down enemies with all three party members in a triangle formation allow a powerful "Triple Threat" attack (with animation reminiscent of the "All-In" attacks from the previous games.)

The Phantom Thieves still use Personas; each member can use their main Persona, which comes with a skill tree of unlockable abilities and bonuses, and a secondary Persona that can have one or two other abilities. As you'd expect, you still have a Velvet Room and you can fuse your secondary Personas to try to complete your Persona compendium.

The game itself isn't too long (for a JRPG at least); it's divided into four "Kingdoms" (your enemies are flavored specifically to the Kingdom's theme), with I think 51 story battles and a number of "quests". Each battle has an objective and optional "awards" you can earn for bonus XP and money; usually there's an award for finishing within N turns, etc. The quests are side missions that explore the game's mechanics more, some of them being more puzzle-like with objectives like bringing an object to a target area or defeating all enemies in one turn. I had some trouble with the first few ones when I didn't understand the mechanics too well!

The game isn't particularly difficult, but I will say the later stages started to get a bit tedious; especially the third and fourth kingdom stages with having to move platforms around and everything. In terms of sotry/ambience/theme I will say the fourth kingdom is much weaker than the others as well. The overall plot and the new characters were okay though.

One complaint I have about the gameplay is that there is no overhead camera view of the entire battlefield, your view is always centered around one of your party members. This seems like quite an oversight for a tactical RPG.

### Stats and Completion

{{% photos stats %}}

Play time: 28.5 hours. My saves say the playtime is only 20hrs, not sure why. There was never any need to reload, since there is no penalty for retrying battles. 

HLTB says 24 hours for a normal run and 38 hours for completionist, sounds about right.

Achievements: I only got 31/39. I completed all the collecting things (awards, quests, etc) EXCEPT for the Compendium. Going for completion would have needed me to grind for levels and money and also start a partial second walkthrough. While the game looked great, I did not enjoy the gameplay enough to go through more of it unnecessarily.

### Screenshots

My screenshots are mostly of dialog and none of the actual gameplay/battles lol.
