I had an exhausting weekend (the good kind) so these weeknotes are coming in a bit late, and possibly quite rushed!

### The World

Netflix's Avatar:TLA live action series has unfortunately gotten middling reviews.

MTG dropped a whole bunch of previews for multiple upcoming sets later this year all at the same time! It's kind of a lot.

### My Week

We had the third infusion day earlier this past week, but as usual it used up our entire day. The rest of the week was fairly chill, with a not a lot of off-site errands to be done. Gave me some time to work on some side projects.

The weekend was exhausting because we had a staycation with the rest of the family over at Seda Manila Bay (not even a year old!) to celebrate my dad's 75th. My dad really loves it when all the grandkids are together, it's always a fun and chaotic time. We were really tired by the time we got home earlier today though.

Our Cignal account was finally activated late last week, a whole TEN DAYS after it was installed. And right after SkyCable announced that the acquisition would **not** be going through and their service would continue, so now we have two Cable TV services hooked up. Will have them both up for a week or so to let the parents decide which one they want to keep.

Mastodon has been dealing with a spam wave this past week, [it has been challenging](/2024/02/111971151235763302/).

On the blog: Wrapped up [the Doctor Strange part of the complete marvel run](/2024/02/cmr-doctor-strange/), and also [wrote a game review](/2024/02/persona-5-tactica/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finished Persona 5 Tactica! (Review linked above). Still playing a bunch of Stellaris. Tales of Arise dropped on PC game pass, so another JRPG to dig into!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Karlov Manor quick drafts have not gone super well for me, might wait for monthly rank reset before continuing lol.

- **Reading**: Finished the Doctor Strange run! Have yet to read any non-comic books for the month of February.

- **Watching**: Started watching Reservation Dogs, but it hasn't really grabbed my attention so far, possibly because I've been side-watching it. Not all shows are good for that.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,437 steps. Was tempted to break the quota a couple of times, but luckily I didn't because I decided not to push the quota today (Sunday) since I'm kind of dead tired, and I only allow myself one skip day every month. (This policy is only on it's second month lol)

### Some Links of Interest

- [With the rise of AI, web crawlers are suddenly controversial - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24067997/robots-txt-ai-text-file-web-crawlers-spiders): 

    > "But robots.txt is not a legal document — and 30 years after its creation, it still relies on the good will of all parties involved."

    > "They believed that the internet was a good place, filled with good people, who above all wanted the internet to be a good thing. In that world, and on that internet, explaining your wishes in a text file was governance enough. "

### This Coming Week

Very much looking forward to the Hulu adaptation of Shogun dropping this week. Shogun is probably [my all-time favorite book](/2018/11/shogun-and-the-rest-of-james-clavells-asian-saga/) and the early reviews say this adaptation is fantastic!

More errands, etc.
