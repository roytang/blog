As you may be aware, there are two federated decentralized social media protocols that are pretty big right now; ActivityPub and ATProto. Per my previous notes on both:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>ActivityPub</strong> is a federated social networking protocol that enables users to interact across different servers and platforms used by popular projects like Mastodon, Pleroma, and PeerTube. It\u2019s been around since 2017 and is born from previous projects like Statusnet and Ostatus. It\u2019s in full federation right now, mainly serving as the underpinning to Mastodon, a microblogging server.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>ATProto</strong> is a newer protocol developed by Bluesky, a public benefit company born from the ideas from former Twitter engineers. The protocol\u2019s main advantage is that it provides true account portability and can scale up with search and discovery. Since it was originally developed to be the successor to Twitter, it also has hooks for composable moderation and algorithms. It\u2019s not federated at the moment, but the only instance using it, the self-titular Bluesky (bsky.app) says \u201cits immenent. Indeed, the company just took down the waitlist and <a href=\"https://starrwulfe.xyz/2024/02/bluesky-open-no-waiting/\">opened up registration to everyone</a> worldwide a few weeks ago.</li>\n</ul><a style=\"text-decoration:none;\" href=\"https://starrwulfe.xyz/2024/02/bluesky-open-no-waiting/\"><img style=\"width:100px;height:100px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/starrwulfe.xyz/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Starrwulfe-dark-pxl-removebg-preview.png?ssl=1\" alt=\"Bluesky takes the velvet rope down ????\" />Bluesky takes the velvet rope down ????Bluesky has opened up and requires no waitlist now, so if you were searching for a Twitter alternative, then here you go: Once registered, find me here: For reference: FeatureBlueskyActivityPub/Mastod\u2026</a>\n\n\n<img src=\"https://res.craft.do/user/full/e09bfa88-b541-db43-4c63-c7deabc34ec1/doc/622D9929-46BE-471B-932C-D52B190D607C/8e1ce62f-b572-4678-bd26-90878da9ea57\" alt=\"OIG1.jpg\" style=\"width:483px;height:auto;\" /><h4><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">So what the hell happened?</span></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, someone built something that can connect both networks together in a sense and a bunch of people who likely don\u2019t really know the technology\u2019s underpinnings instead proceeded to blow up their victim status to trigger everyone else and brigade the developer who was asking for constructive dialoge and ideas <strong>before</strong> he got too far in the development process.</p>\n\n\n<a style=\"text-decoration:none;\" href=\"http://snarfed.org/2024-02-12_52106\"><img style=\"width:100px;height:100px;\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/snarfed.org/iraq_square.jpg?ssl=1\" alt=\"snarfed.org\" />snarfed.orgsnarfed.orgFediverse!

You\u2019ll be able to follow people on Blu\u2026</a>\n\n\n<p>Now I must note, I\u2019ve been using Ryan\u2019s <a href=\"http://brid.gy\">Bridgy</a> site and suite of crossposting tools ever since I got into the <a href=\"https://indieweb.org\">Indieweb</a> movement as it ticks all my boxes for making my content go all over the web and whatever comments and discussions take place out there, I can track and archive them on my site without worrying if I\u2019ll get taken down, or the site goes dark. Bridgy already has bridges for Mastodon, Reddit, Facebook, and even supported Instagram and Twitter before they became\u2026 drunk with power. I am eagerly awaiting the day when I can sit on Bluesky and follow Mastodon folks or sit on Mastodon and comment on Bluesky posts\u2026 Or better yet, tag everyone in both places from this blog right here. ActivityPub and ATProto are open source and its pretty easy to make tools like this unlike feeling around in the dark with undocumented APIs that may get shut down at any second; That\u2019s why we can\u2019t do this with Instagram!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s no secret the fediverse is the social media of choice for those who feel voiceless and vulnerable on the other \u201cbig\u201d networks; you can gain a sense of community and comradery on an instance with others sharing the same experiences. However, it is still <em>a <strong>social</strong> network.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Social</strong>:</span> relating to or involving activities in which people spend time talking to each other or doing enjoyable things with each other.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\"><strong>Network</strong>:</span> a system of devices, or entities including people and animals that are connected and can communicate with each other.</li>\n</ul><p>So in regard to having a bridge to connect the two together\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer and I thought everyone else was looking forward to having it like myself.

This is the internet and it wasn\u2019t designed for you to have your entire-ass identity tied to it. This is truely the reason social media is some bullshit sometimes. The internet is supposed to be a communication tool, not some MMORPG for y\u2019all to live your whole existence. If anything, your IRL personality should extend INTO it, not the other way around. Dude could\u2019ve just cut the bridge on, posted Github links and lol\u2019d all the way to the way to the next project and there wouldn\u2019t be much you or I could say; the fediverse has no Ts&amp;Cs to violate!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Attempt to learn the technology before you postulate whatever opinions around it.</strong> Don\u2019t come up with some off-the-cuff hot take on how you think the bridge is suddenly going to aim 3 million users of Network A at your posts on being a furry/inanimate-curious who happens to be in a cross-species relationship with a hubcap from a 1993 Chevy Corsica that happen to be publicly available on Network B. That\u2019s not how network bridges work. Understand that whatever you\u2019ve posted publicly anywhere is subject to someone reading it and deciding to give you a like or give a hateful comment. They don\u2019t need a bridge to do it; they can <em>already just make an account on the network you\u2019re already on and fuck with you.</em> It\u2019s actually easier for them and less traceable!</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>We already have bridges now.</strong> Consider this post is on my own personal blog powered by WordPress. It\u2019s being cross-posted <a href=\"https://starrwulfe.xyz/2024/02/on-the-subject-of-connecting-federated-social-media-networks/www.indieweb.org/POSSE\">POSSE-style</a> to wherever you\u2019re reading this or got referred from, whether it was through an automatic script, or I manually cut and pasted over. My blog <em>is already acting as a bridge</em> and there are many others like it. It\u2019s been that way in the past, and someone was bound to create this technology. If it\u2019s not @snarfed, then it\u2019ll be someone else. But mark my words, it\u2019s gonna happen.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Learn the difference between protocols and applications.</strong> Bluesky is an application on the ATProto protocol. Mastodon is an application on the ActivityPub protocol. Both are facets of the wider fediverse. Don\u2019t conflate these things. This blog is an application on BOTH those protocols and also does webmentions and other cool things. Once ATProto is fully federated and opened, it\u2019s only a matter of time before I can snag an ATProto plugin in the same manner as the ActivityPub one and have it not even need to rely on a \u201ctranslator\u201d like Bridgy for that part. (If I just lost you with the technobabble, now you see why it\u2019s important to seek to understand this technology before reacting to some perceived threat.)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>You\u2019re not in a walled garden on the fediverse.</strong> You\u2019re in the open and as such you more than anyone should understand and respect the right to choose. The power here is in your hands and you have the ability to block, but your right to do so ends at the tip of your own nose and doesn\u2019t come anywhere near mine. Also realize both ActivityPub and ATProto were designed for openness first; if you seek privacy and isolation, then you need to grab Signal and create some rooms there with some buddies away from the open internet.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Assholes exist everywhere.</strong> Don\u2019t conflate the tech of one place with the ability to keep bigots, fascists, bullys, and jackasses from your timeline. Moreover, don\u2019t shoo away people that are trying to do things that are inevitable anyway from doing it correctly! Understand federation is going to happen with or without your input if not by this project, by someone else. There\u2019s no hiding, there\u2019s no \u201csafe place\u201d except the one you create and control yourself within or without these places.</li>\n</ol><blockquote>\n<p>Letting you connect to other people you care about is not unethical or immoral. You have a lot of options for whether you want to participate in the BS bridge\u2013either by managing your follows directly, by blocking users from that domain, or by blocking the whole domain. This is how federation works. You have absolute control over who you interact with.</p>\n<a href=\"https://social.vivaldi.net/@evan@cosocial.ca/111925732614920143\">Evan Prodromou (@evan@cosocial.ca)</a></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\u2019m approaching this line of thinking from my longtime use, contribution and propagation of FOSS/open-source software and the use of my actual social media of choice, the <a href=\"https://starrwulfe.xyz/2024/02/on-the-subject-of-connecting-federated-social-media-networks/indieweb.org\">indieweb</a> which is best summed up here:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://werd.io/tag/IndieWeb\">#IndieWeb</a> is for everyone, everyone who wants to be part of the world-wide-web of interconnected people.

However, it is still a social network.\n\n\n\nSocial: relating to or involving activities in which people spend time talking to each other or doing enjoyable things with each other.\n\n\n\nNetwork: a system of devices, or entities including people and animals that are connected and can communicate with each other.\nSo in regard to having a bridge to connect the two together\u2026 Yeah, it\u2019s kind of a no-brainer and I thought everyone else was looking forward to having it like myself. Boy was I wrong:\n\n\n\n\nYou need to make this opt IN not opt OUT. It absolutely fucking sucks that you want to force the majority of decentralized posts here into content for Jack fucking Dorsey.\nCyrus (still a bit spooky tbh) (@Cyrus@zirk.us)\n\n\n\n\nhonestly fuck you. Do you really expect everybody to have enough space in their bios to opt-out of your fucking bs? How many opt-out bs am I supposed to put there?\nJoshix ???? (@joshix@fosspri.de)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Take:\n\n\n\nI honestly don\u2019t get the vitrolic knee-jerk posts I saw coming left and right from some corners of the fediverse, then I started noticing the pattern: It\u2019s mostly people not understanding what the goals of both ActivityPub and ATProto are as a protocol and their equating it to Mastodon and Bluesky as \u201cpsudo-corporations\u201d that have some level of control\u2026 And even perhaps Ryan\u2019s attempt to bridge both protocols with free and open source software that is literally already working to bridge other social networks as I type this, as some imaginary invasion mob coming to victimize them on the internet. ????\n\n\n\nAllow me to say this as a member of a marginalized group of people in real life who has had my share of internet trolls come at me: (I\u2019m a Black man from the USA, and I have yet to lose my Black Card, am a refugee repping #BlackTwitter into the Fediverse on both Bsky and Masto so I think I can speak on some things.)\n\n\n\nGet out of your feelings. The animosity is unwarranted and uncalled for. This is the internet and it wasn\u2019t designed for you to have your entire-ass identity tied to it. This is truely the reason social media is some bullshit sometimes. The internet is supposed to be a communication tool, not some MMORPG for y\u2019all to live your whole existence. If anything, your IRL personality should extend INTO it, not the other way around. Dude could\u2019ve just cut the bridge on, posted Github links and lol\u2019d all the way to the way to the next project and there wouldn\u2019t be much you or I could say; the fediverse has no Ts&Cs to violate!\n\n\n\nAttempt to learn the technology before you postulate whatever opinions around it. Don\u2019t come up with some off-the-cuff hot take on how you think the bridge is suddenly going to aim 3 million users of Network A at your posts on being a furry/inanimate-curious who happens to be in a cross-species relationship with a hubcap from a 1993 Chevy Corsica that happen to be publicly available on Network B. That\u2019s not how network bridges work. Understand that whatever you\u2019ve posted publicly anywhere is subject to someone reading it and deciding to give you a like or give a hateful comment. They don\u2019t need a bridge to do it; they can already just make an account on the network you\u2019re already on and fuck with you. It\u2019s actually easier for them and less traceable!\n\n\n\nWe already have bridges now. Consider this post is on my own personal blog powered by WordPress. It\u2019s being cross-posted POSSE-style to wherever you\u2019re reading this or got referred from, whether it was through an automatic script, or I manually cut and pasted over. My blog is already acting as a bridge and there are many others like it. It\u2019s been that way in the past, and someone was bound to create this technology. If it\u2019s not @snarfed, then it\u2019ll be someone else. But mark my words, it\u2019s gonna happen.\n\n\n\nLearn the difference between protocols and applications. Bluesky is an application on the ATProto protocol. Mastodon is an application on the ActivityPub protocol. Both are facets of the wider fediverse. Don\u2019t conflate these things. This blog is an application on BOTH those protocols and also does webmentions and other cool things. Once ATProto is fully federated and opened, it\u2019s only a matter of time before I can snag an ATProto plugin in the same manner as the ActivityPub one and have it not even need to rely on a \u201ctranslator\u201d like Bridgy for that part. (If I just lost you with the technobabble, now you see why it\u2019s important to seek to understand this technology before reacting to some perceived threat.)\n\n\n\nYou\u2019re not in a walled garden on the fediverse. You\u2019re in the open and as such you more than anyone should understand and respect the right to choose. The power here is in your hands and you have the ability to block, but your right to do so ends at the tip of your own nose and doesn\u2019t come anywhere near mine. Also realize both ActivityPub and ATProto were designed for openness first; if you seek privacy and isolation, then you need to grab Signal and create some rooms there with some buddies away from the open internet.\n\n\n\nAssholes exist everywhere. Don\u2019t conflate the tech of one place with the ability to keep bigots, fascists, bullys, and jackasses from your timeline. Moreover, don\u2019t shoo away people that are trying to do things that are inevitable anyway from doing it correctly! Understand federation is going to happen with or without your input if not by this project, by someone else. There\u2019s no hiding, there\u2019s no \u201csafe place\u201d except the one you create and control yourself within or without these places.\n\nLetting you connect to other people you care about is not unethical or immoral. You have a lot of options for whether you want to participate in the BS bridge\u2013either by managing your follows directly, by blocking users from that domain, or by blocking the whole domain. This is how federation works. You have absolute control over who you interact with.\nEvan Prodromou (@evan@cosocial.ca)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019m approaching this line of thinking from my longtime use, contribution and propagation of FOSS/open-source software and the use of my actual social media of choice, the indieweb which is best summed up here:\n\n\n\n\nThe #IndieWeb is for everyone, everyone who wants to be part of the world-wide-web of interconnected people. The social internet of people, a network of networks of people, connected peer-to-peer in human-scale groups, communities of locality and affinity.\ntantek.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, one more thing:\n\n\n\n\nThe most important lesson, I\u2019ve ever learned about online privacy is this one: If you want something to be private online, don\u2019t put it online in the first place.\nDavidB (@DavidBHimself)\n\n\n\nUpdates & Errata\n\n\n\nPardon the typos, grammar bombs and double negatives in my \u201cstream of consciousness\u201d manner of writing this particular post. My years of journalism prowess still requires fresh eyes and a fresher cup of coffee. Being that this is my blog and not a column in a major publication, I\u2019m a bit lax so ????????\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2026fuhgeddaboudit!\n\n\n\n????
