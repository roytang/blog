Also your further thoughts on saving comments. The same thing drives me, because many users regularly delete their Mastodon posts and have the right to do so. Am I then allowed to save them, even if I want to? My solution is to query them via webmention.io via client script when loading the page. If a post is gone ... well then it&#39;s gone.</p>",
