title: 'Weeknotes 2024-02-11: Gong XI Fa Cai'
---

It feels like when I was a kid "Kung Hei Fat Choi" was the more common Chinese New Year greeting around here, but these days I more commonly see commercial establishments post "Gong Xi Fa Cai" instead. I guess modern Chinese communities are more inclined towards Mandarin these days?

### The World

Huh, apparently [Nitter is dead](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/issues/1155). Too bad.

### My Week

We are back to straight-up scorching hot weather. That usually means I have to take my walks earlier in the day or later in the night. By the time 7:30am rolls around the sun is already quite intense.

This week was a bit busy, with nonmedical stuff this time, and I even managed to stay productive. Got some stuff done, moved forward some old dormant projects, etc.

Wednesday I took my parents to a passport renewal appointment I had set up, mostly because my brother has been pestering us to take them on a trip. When I did my passport renewal in late 2022 I think I had an afternoon appointment and spent like half an hour or more in the queue, but this time we had an 11am appointment and there were practically no other people there and they were done in 10 minutes. Just need to wait for the passport delivery! We had lunch at the mall, bought some CNY stuff, and after that I left them to go complain about something at the Globe store.

Thursday [we attended a quiz night and won](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-hobby-stadium)!

For some reason PLDT has decided to end Sky's cable service by Feb 27. If it were just me I would just not have cable TV, but the parents watch a lot of it (even though most programs they watch are actually also up on Youtube, etc), so I had to shop around for a new one. Cignal finally called me back last Friday and so later this week we're expecting an installation team to come over. Looks like the cost might end up cheaper than what we were paying for SkyCable, so that's a plus.

Over the weekend we had family meetup that doubled as a CNY celebration combined with multiple birthdays. It's always chaos when all the pamangkins get together!

On the blog: Only other post this past week was [the retro game review for Super Mario Land 2](/2024/02/super-mario-land-2/)


### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Trying to power through **Persona 5 Tactica** now that Persona 3 Reload is out! But I also started playing **Stellaris** again!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Maybe also **Eternal** sometimes. New set dropped on Arena this week, but I've only had time for 2 drafts so far and have not yet gotten a trophy.
    - Others: Trivia team has still been enjoying playing Cine2Nerdle battle (probably a bit too much). 

- **Reading**: No book readng this week, but I am making good progress on my comic book runs. I have finished two volumes of Doctor Strange over the past week, and quite a few limited series as well. The modern runs are always so much easier to read than the older ones! Also, I have fallen behind with my RSS feeds and the unread counts are starting to get unwieldy!

- **Watching**: Nothing new this week!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,227 steps. Feeling a bit better despite the hot weather.

### Some Links of Interest

- [How to set your domain as your handle - Bluesky](https://bsky.social/about/blog/4-28-2023-domain-handle-tutorial): I have very little to zero interest in using Bluesky, but I did thing the idea of using your domain as your handle was neat, so now I have the account "@roytang.net" https://bsky.app/profile/roytang.net

- [Today’s YouTubers are repeating the mistakes of yesterday’s bloggers – A Whole Lotta Nothing](https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2024/02/05/todays-youtubers-are-repeating-the-mistakes-of-yesterdays-bloggers/): Honestly don't care about how Youtubers make money, but I enjoyed the parallels with how advertising infected the blogging world

### Site Changes

- My efforts at cleaning up/archiving old notes content continue.
- Minor UI fixes as usual
- Trivia bot: For some time, the [Mastodon trivia bot](https://botsin.space/triviastorm) has been having trouble if the users submit answers within the time peroid but due to network/federation delay, the bot doesn't catch them at the time of checking. I spent some time last week working on a daily job that should catch such stray items from the past 24h and retroactively award points, so hopefully that problem is solved.

### Things I've been thinking about

Chinese New Year, holidays, lack of SMS notifications, family, travel, productivity, frontends, things ending, staycations, discarding old things

### This Coming Week

Next week will be quite busy I think.

- medical errands in prep for the next infusion
- cignal installation
- Ash Wednesday

Oh also I believe the big sports bowl thing is tomorrow morning (PH time); I am looking forward to new trailers and such. And maybe Taylor Swift getting married on the spot after the Chiefs win and then immediately endorsing Joe Biden.
