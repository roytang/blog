### New Month

It is February! I don't normally do "monthnotes", but I wanted to note (mostly to myself) that I managed to go the entire month of January mostly not eating chips/crisps. The one exception was when my dad came up to my room and put an already opened can of Pringles on my desk and told me to eat them because the flavor wasn't available locally and my uncle had brought some from overseas. (I was later told the flavor was actually available in the international aisle of some of the bigger local groceries.)

This was a bit more than halfway through the month so I was already hoping I could complete the month without eating chips/crisps so I left the can there thinking it would still be good in Feb, but my willpower lasted a bit less than 24 hours!

Regardless, I made it the rest of the month without eating anymore chips/crisps which is a big deal for me as I'll usually have a bag or so a few times a week. I may or may not have eaten more carbs for snacks, which may also be a problem, but at least it's something!

### The World

Huh, apparently [nitter is dead](https://github.com/zedeus/nitter/issues/1155). Too bad.

### My Week

The weather is starting to get a bit hotter again. The crisp amihan weather did not last long enough. At least I no longer have a cold.

Monday was infusion day, so we spent most of the day in the hospital. Apparently even when we are well-prepared it still takes a while.

Surprise family visits over the weekend, as usual.

Globe fiber has once again added an unexpected additional P99 fee for unlimited calls to Globe/TM presumably because I had a freebie that ended. If it were me, I would of course just end the freebie without billing the customer anymore, but noooo, Globe chooses to just assume I want to pay for the feature I have never paid for before. I am now in my 3rd day of trying to negotiate their messenger customer support channels to get the charge removed. (I'll probably just end up complaining at the Globe store when I go to the mall this week).

There seems to be some kind of instability happening on botsin.space which might be causing some problems with my triviabot, I need to allot some time to investigate the issues further.

On the blog: I wrote a bunch of reviews (links below). 

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: The final stage of **Super Mario Land 2** was a lot of trouble, I eventually gave up and used the Switch's Save point feature to power through it. Will write a short review at some point this week. **Persona 5 Tactica** is still proceeding albeit a bit slowly. Persona 3 Reload is already out, but it might take me a while to get there!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.
    - Others: Trivia team has still been enjoying playing Cine2Nerdle battle (probably a bit too much). Last Friday we managed to hit the leaderboards for the first time!

- **Reading**: Currently on the 3rd volume of Doctor Strange, less than halfway through. Finished Reaper Man (Discworld), review is linked above. Finished two Sanderson books: [Firefight](/2024/01/firefight/) and [Calamity](/2024/01/calamity/). Comics-wise, I am close to finishing the 3rd volume of Doctor Strange (getting through the 90s is challenging).

- **Watching**: I wrote [a summary of movies/TV I watched in Jan 2024](/2024/02/movies-tv-jan-2024/)

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 69,982 steps. I screwed up yesterday; I thought I already had enough to hit the weekly quota and stopped too early.

Luckily my colds have dissipated, after only 3-4 entire sheets of Neozep Forte.
