### My Week

For most of the past week we had some repairs/renovations happening on the second floor which basically meant I couldn't use my room or my desktop PC for almost 4 days. A bit disruptive to my regular routines (i.e. daily quests lol). It took us an additional half a day or so to sort out the mess since there was a lot of dust and stuff had been moved to different rooms and that led to tossing out a bunch of older stuff I probably kept for way too long and also randomly finding old stuff that I had forgotten I had and don't even remember where they came from anymore.

I am slightly annoyed at how much houses need to be maintained, but to be fair this house is more than 20 years old already. All part of [being mortal](/2023/12/being-mortal/) that I have to get used to as I get older I guess.

My room is a lot less cluttered now, but mostly because a lot of my desk clutter and other stuff is still in boxes that I really need to sort out.

For some reason when I turned on my computer again after a few days of not using it, Firefox decided to forget that I prefer dark mode. I have not looked into it yet.

Still had a bunch of errands to do this week; basically lost a couple of weekdays to them.

Thursday night the trivia team attended [the first PopQuiz of the year](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-errors), but we didn't win.

On the blog: wrote about [User Agents](/2024/03/user-agents/) and [Do A Powerbomb](/2024/03/powerbomb/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Despite the 4-day hiatus, I believe I am close to finishing **Tales of Arise**, possibly at right before the final boss already. That has meant it was time to go backtracking and finishing up side quests before pushing through. I think there is a bunch of post-game stuff to do for completion, so I would guess it would take me another week or two to wrap thing sup maybe?
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** (missed a few days of daily quests due to desktop not being available!) and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Next Arena set drops mid-April, so I might be done with MKM for now, though I suspect I will try to sneak in a draft or two after the ranks reset at end of month.

- **Reading**: Guardians reading is proceeding apace; much easier to read stuff in the 2000s as usual, and I think I'm up to around 2015 or so already. Still haven't started any new books!

- **Watching**: Decided to go to the cinema last week to watch **Dune Part Two**. I am still annoyed at how expensive cinema prices are these days, but I figure I can afford to go maybe four times a year or such, and probably this particular movie was worth seeing in the cinema. Also watched a couple of new movies on Prime Video: **Ricky Stanicky** and **Road House**. As usual, [all my movie reviews are up on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/), but I will probably be writing a reviews round up post here at the end of the month. For TV series, keeping up with new Shogun, Invincible, X-Men 97, and the last season of Jack Ryan.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,119 steps. 

### Website Changes

Work on the planned 2024 site redesign kind of took a pause this week since I don't like doing website work away from my desktop. Hopefully can at least start to get back into it this week.

### This Coming Week

Today is Palm Sunday, and the coming week is [Holy Week](/2019/04/holy-week/), which is usually a kind of rest week around here. We do have some errands that need to be done in prep for the next infusion. The long weekend should be mostly chill though, maybe I can catch up on some stuff. (Or just play a lot of Tales of Arise, IDK really.)

It will be April next week!
