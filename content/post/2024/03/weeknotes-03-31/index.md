title: Weeknotes 2024-03-31 Easter? I hardly knew her!

Today is:

- the last day of March
- Easter Sunday
- Also apparently [Trans Day of Visibility](https://glaad.org/tdov/), which pissed off right-wing types when Biden happened to point out it falls on Easter Sunday this year

### The world

The open source tech world was rocked by [a new vulnerability that came out a day or so ago in a widely used Linux utility](https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/backdoor-found-in-widely-used-linux-utility-breaks-encrypted-ssh-connections/) that breaks encrypted SSH connections. This is the sort of thing that could really only interest the tech folks (even I had a hard time [following all the details](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor)), but has massive implications for cyber security etc.

### My Week

Might not have a lot to talk about this week. It was of course Holy Week this past week. My week was a mix of religious obligations, family meetups, a bit of work on side projects, medical errands and so on. Kind of broke my regular rhythms actually, had lots of stuff to do.

Also did a bunch of cleaning up and throwing away old stuff. My shredder still works! Still a lot of work to do.

The summer weather has been very weird; most of the time incredibly hot but sometimes punctuated by short rainshowers which provide a bit of reliefr but afterwards we kind of curse the heat index due to increased humidity.

On the blog: nothing other than weeknotes this week; was hoping to write some other stuff before the month ends, but I'll push them to next week.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I have already finished **Tales of Arise** and am working on post-game stuff. Might be able to write my review this week or the next. Also started and am enjoying another game of **Stellaris**, now that I have new DLC content to encounter.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. I have been doing poorly on the Snap ladder this month and have been stuck in the 70s for the past two weeks or so.

- **Reading**: Guardians reading is proceeding apace, though I got distracted by some cosmic event books. Already well into 2019, so I think I am close to the end?

- **Watching**: Huh, no new movies this week, and I also fell behind on the ongoing TV series I follow. I did manage to finish **Jack Ryan** on Prime Video though. Will write some reviews this week!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 60,500 steps. I had decided to skip Good Friday as my one skip day for the month, so this was fine. It's usually super hot from around 8am to 6pm, making it hard to find a good time for walking, especially if I wake up too late.

### Website Changes

I managed a bunch of work on the planned 2024 site redesign this week. If I try to wait until everything I want to do is done I might never finish, so I might already deploy something this week.

### Some Links of Interest
