title: Weeknotes 2024-03-17
---

I will be the first to admit that having to write these weeknotes every week can be a bit daunting ("I have to write another one?!?"), which is why it's a bit surprising how I had the discipline to keep this habit going continuously since I started it in [January 2020](/2020/01/weeknotes-01-12/)! (Rereading that first weeknotes entry was fun!)

### My Week

Our fourth infusion session went well last Monday, actually a bit better than expected because there weren't a lot of people and we were able to be processed early and consequently could go home earlier. I got to get some more sleep in!

This week I wanted to do a lot more work on some side projects like the UI refresh for this website, but that was kind of derailed because (a) gaming; and (b) I found out middle of the week that we were going to do some repair work on our second floor ceiling and that meant I couldn't use my room for at least a couple of days. I was only told about it the day before it was originally supposed to start! I said I needed at least a couple of days to figure out if I could move my desktop elsewhere in the house and also move out some stuff that I didn't want to leave in the room while strangers were doing repair work, so the start of the work was rescheduled to tomorrow (Monday) instead. I ended up deciding to just leave my desktop PC in the room as I didn't have any other good place for it elsewhere in the house, which means I might not be able to use it for a few days. Hopefully the repairs/renovations finish quickly!

Monday evening [we attended a Disney/Pixar quiz night at a new venue](/collections/quiznights/cinema76-disney). We did well, but due to various reasons I was unable to avail of the free cinema ticket I got as part of the prize (they were NOT transferable which was annoying).

On the blog: Wrote about [my app that does nothing](/2024/03/does-nothing/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing probably too much **Tales of Arise** as I really enjoy the battle system. I suspect I am on track to finish the game before month's end (possibly early April if I need to do completion stuff), even despite losing a few days due to the home reno.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Arena Limited Rank is back up to Platinum and I really should have stopped there but did a few more drafts which did poorly and tanked my WR for MKM. Still doing better than LCI!
    - Steam Spring Sale has started this week! Because I've been intending to play even more [Stellaris](/2016/05/stellaris-review/), I bought a bunch of DLC during this sale. The last time I bought DLC for this game was in 2018! Might be time to do a follow-up review actually.

- **Reading**: I finished reading the one regular ongoing for the original Guardians team. There's a bunch of other side series I want to read before moving on. Still haven't started any new non-comic books!

- **Watching**: It was Oscars week, I figured I should watch at least one of the best picture nominees and **American Fiction (2023)** was up on Prime Video so I watched that. Reviews are currently [up on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/). Also watched season 3 of Jack Ryan on Prime Video.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,243 steps. More very long walks this week, including me attempting twice to walk the entirety of Visayas Avenue again (gave up halway through both times), and walking the entirety of East Avenue to get to the quiz night venue from the circle. 

During that last walk, I had to cross this ridiculously high footbridge across EDSA:

I don't do especially well with heights, but I thought this one would be manageable. Not sure if it was some kind of vertigo or what but I kind of felt the footbridge wobble a bit as the MRT passed underneath and I had to grab the railing with both hands to steady myself. I will not take this route again!

### Website Changes

Work on the planned 2024 site redesign this week continues apace, though at a much slower rate. Not sure when I am gonna be able to deploy it live. Hopefully I can get more done after the room reno is done. 

### Some Links of Interest

I don't have any links to share today! 
    
Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This Coming Week

As mentioned, room ceiling repairs/renovations start tomorrow and hopefully will be done quickly.

We have another quiz night on Thursday, first PopQuiz of the year.

I believe new X-Men 97 season drops this week as well. I was also looking forward to the new 3-Body Problem adaptation dropping on NF, but the reviews have been kind of mixed, so I might not watch that immediately.
