Often when the New Year rolls around I'll go through "best comics of 2023" lists to see if any indie titles catch my fancy, to provide some contrast to my usual fare of superhero Marvel/DC. This year, the first such title I read is **"Do A Powerbomb"** by Daniel Warren Johnson.

This was a 7-issue limited series published by Image that covers a story of pro wrestling and family that starts from tragedy and quickly escalates into to a inter-dimensional tournament facing contenders from other worlds where the idea of pro wrestling being scripted is laughably ridiculous. 

My favorite trivia about this book is that the creator Daniel Warren Johnson had just only recently discovered the insane world of pro wrestling and just absolutely devoured it and loved it so much he decided to write about a comic about it. His artwork is vibrant and colorful and messy and his enthusiasm for the sports entertainment staple shows in his selection of plot twists and finishing moves. 

Overall a fantastic and well-drawn story that was so good it led me to finally starting to read the creator's _Transformers_ ongoing from Skybound which has also been getting rave reviews. (I will write about that at some other point!)
