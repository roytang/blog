title: Weeknotes 2024-03-03 How Do They Keep Sneaking Past Us?
---

Somehow another month got away from us. What are those guards doing? Time marches on.

### The World

...continues to be horrible. Maybe I'll skip writing about it this week.

### My Week

I kind of zombied my way through the first couple of days of the week mostly because I was exhausted from the past weekend.

A few errands this week, including accompanying someone to an overpriced dental visit and I also submitted an applcation form and haven't yet received the feedback I was expecting, triggering my anxiety because I kind of did not fill out one of the forms correctly. 

The folks decided to keep Cignal, so I had our SkyCable account disconnected this week and unplugged the modems and put them in a box. Skycable said they were already obselete so we didn't need to surrender them. Not sure what I can do with these.

Had another fun (and exhausting) family get-together yesterday, for Nephew #1's 7th birthday bash. Lots of kids playing around; I mostly helped with the younger ones.

On the blog: Nothing this week, just the weeknotes!

Edit: Oh, there was another fire near our subdivision in the middle of the week. This one was a bit farther from us than the one last year, looks like it was in the back roads where there's a depressed area. Fires typically spread there easier because the houses are clustered together. The plume of smoke was large enough for me to see I was out on a noontime walk. I saw probably around 30 fire trucks and maybe 4-5 ambulances pass by and go into those back roads; that was probably challenging since those roads are very narrow. Some of the fire trucks came from other cities like Marikina and Valenzuela.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Started playing Tales of Arise: [Youtube video of me playing through the start of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfTh2AhyEt4). I think I'm currently less than 10 hours in, but I'm enjoying it a lot. This iteration of the Tales combat system is possibly the finest it's ever been. Also, I stopped playing **Stellaris** for a while because there was an update and a Fallen Empire was thrashing me in my game anyway. Will wait for a Steam sale to get some DLCs before I start playing again.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Squeezed in a Karlov Manor premiere draft yesterday, it went well. I am generally doing much better with this set than with LCI!

- **Reading**: Still no non-comic book reading so far. I did read more comics: started on the first GotG volume, caught up on some DC, and some newer comics as well.

- **Watching**: Started watching the FX Shogun adaptation on Disney+ and it's only 2 episodes in but it so good, and has much better pacing and attention to detail than I was expecting. I am so looking forward to writing the eventual review.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a a mere 60,964 steps. This is my lowest weekly total since the year began! This averages out to 10k+ per day, but I actually missed the quota both last Sunday and yesterday (Saturday), both busy weekeneds due to family activities.

### Things I've Been Thinking About

Productivity, time management, upcoming (hopefully) changes to this website, getting back into it.

### This Coming Week

Dune part 2 is out, but IDK if I want to watch it in the cinemas. The high ticket prices continue to annoy me.
