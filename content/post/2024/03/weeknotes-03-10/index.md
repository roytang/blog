### The World

[Akira Toriyama has passed away at the age of 68](https://asia.nikkei.com/Life-Arts/Obituaries/Akira-Toriyama-creator-of-Dragon-Ball-dies-at-68). It's hard to overestate his influence on world culture. Dragon Ball basically introduced anime to the world outside Japan and he worked on iconic RPG franchise Dragon Quest without which we would not have the entire JRPG genre. Truly a GOAT.

### My Week

Still had a bunch of errands to do this past week, mostly in prep for Monday's infusion, even a couple of unexpected ones.

After my last unexpected trip to the hospital, I decided to [pass by the Quezon Memorial Circle](/2024/03/112060366344106930/), haven't been there in a while. [Last visit was in May 2023](/2023/05/Cr_KoiFP7wf/)!

One of my cousins opened up an unli-wings restaurant franchise near our place (about 30 minutes walk), so we had takeout from there a couple of times this week.

Spent some time angrily arguing with Globe CS this week, over something I was told would be handled a month ago. It might be worth a full blog post already! Maybe if it still persists next month.

On the blog: Same as last week, no new posts, just the weeknotes! That's okay, that's why I have the weeknotes! 

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Been playing a lot of **Tales of Arise**, possibly too much! I think I've played around 15 hours over the past week!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. I have worked my way back to Limited Platinum rank in Arena through MKM drafts, so it isn't going too poorly, but now I kind of want to pause again until montly reset sends me back to friendlier matches!
    - Today is [Mario day](/2017/03/840184366705790978/)! I was kind of hoping Super Mario 3D World would be on sale on the Switch eShop; Niece #1 really liked that game but our WiiU disc died and I kind of want Nephew #2 to try it out. But it's still full price! Nintendo sales are never cheap enough for me anyway.

- **Reading**: Still no non-comic book reading so far. I did read more comics, mostly the same series as last week.

- **Watching**: Found out that the first season of the [Criminal Minds](/2020/02/criminal-minds/) continuation was on D+, so I watched all 10 eps of that this week. Caught up with Shogun, still so good. For some reason I decided to watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2014) and the sequel, mostly because they were leaving Netflix in a couple of weeks. Reviews are currently [up on Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/). Will probably write another TV/movies review post at the end of March.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,067 steps. Some long walks this week too, instead of my usual breaking up the days into shorter walks. Mostly because I've found myself being lazier in the mornings.

### Things I've Been Thinking About

Uncertainty leading to anxiety, UK vs American English, Duolingo, home renovations, expenses.

### Website Changes

I have been working on my planned 2024 site redesign this week (originally a 2022 site redesign, then 2023, now finally getting around to it!) The work is mostly local for now, until I get all my ducks in a row and figure out how I want things to look, though a few changes may have already seeped through to the live site.

    > "The marketing hype surrounding AI in recent months has been intense, pervasive, and deceptive. AI is usually cast as being hyper competent, and superhuman. To hear the capitalists who are developing it, AI is powerful, mysterious, dangerous, and inevitable. In reality, it's almost none of those things."

AI, as it's been built today, is a tool to sell out our collective futures in order to enrich already wealthy people."

### This Coming Week

Tomorrow is our 4th infusion day. And trivia team is planning to attend a quiz night in the evening as well, so I have a full day ahead. Other than that, the week should be relatively light I hope.
