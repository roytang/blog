It is August! Gonna be a bit busy today, so I'm doing this entry early.

### The World

Venezuela authorities have shadily declared Maduro the winner in a hotly contested election, but opposition leaders claim he actually lost in a landslide. The USA and other countries have demanded detailed vote breakdowns and audits and many have refused to recognize the results.

### My Week

I had kind of lax week, though there were still the usual things to do as prep for the next immunotherapy session. I used the spare time to read more video games and read more comics lol.

A few months ago we switched to Cignal TV from SkyCable, mostly because Sky pulled a "we are quitting the business" bait and switch and later said "actually we are not", but by then we had already signed up for Cignal TV. I am mentioning this because I have wrangled my first rebate from Cignal TV due to an extended outage over the bad weather last week. Well, I assume it, they say the rebate will be reflected in my next bill. I have also learned that I should just report outages as soon as possible instead of waiting to see if it gets better when the weather clears up, to maximize any potential rebates.

We [won a quiz night last Wednesday](/2024/07/popquiz-8-friendship/)!

On the blog: I wrote [a bunch of movie/TV reviews](/2024/08/movies-tv-jun-jul-2024/), [a book review](/2024/08/wind-up-bird/) and [a new Complete Marvel Run post](/2024/08/cmr-heroes-for-hire/)!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Moving on from Hades! I didn't want to dig into a long game yet, so instead I started playing a new metroidvania, **Afterimage** on Steam. I easily get engrossed in metroidvanias, so I am already some 19.5 hours in lol.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Grinding the new Alliances mode in Snap! Started [streaming Bloomburrow drafts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf1ua1d3fqU)!
  
- **Reading**: Finished reading a book! (Review linked above.) Started reading a new one!

- **Watching**: I've only watched one episode of the new **Batman: Caped Crusader** on Prime Video. Watched a bunch of movies in the early part of the week, they are noted in the review post linked above.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 60,074 steps. I lost Friday due to some combination of unfortunate weather timing and also playing too much Afterimage.

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot today.

- [I watched Nvidia's Computex 2024 keynote and it made my blood run cold | TechRadar](https://www.techradar.com/computing/i-watched-nvidias-computex-2024-keynote-and-it-made-my-blood-run-cold)

Honestly, I haven't been too interested in tech news lately, which is one of my usual sources of links to share. The feed reader backlog is starting to pile up again though,

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This Coming Week

We have yet another immunotherapy session tomorrow!

Some milestone might be hit later this week I suppose.
