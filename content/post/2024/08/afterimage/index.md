After spending almost 90 hours playing through [my last (single-player) game](/2024/07/hades/#_), I decided to do a shorter one instead and settled on [Afterimage](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1701520/Afterimage/), a Metroidvania developed by a Shanghai-based publisher.

I normally enjoy a good metroidvania, and this one was no exception. I loved exploring and fighting and unlocking new abilities... to a point. After a certain point I started to feel like this game's map was way way too massive! I kept unlocking more areas and more abilities and so on. The map is so huge and the exploration so nonlinear that it's easy to get lost and waste hours exploring areas you just aren't meant to be in yet. It felt like I was never entirely sure where I should be going but I just kept exploring random areas until I managed to advance quests/story. 

Things got a bit more tedious when I got to that late-game stage where you're backtracking to check on things you were previously unable to access. Normally I enjoy this phase of the game, but the fast-travel system in the game is kind of limited; each area only has one main save point that you can freely fast-travel to. Other save points can be fast-travelled to at a cost; you have to consume an item that at first is only available through pickups and that you can only purchase more of later in the game. Given the limited nature I stuck with the free fast travel most of the time, which meant a lot of time wasted getting to where I wanted to go. Many of the NPC quests also require you to backtrack a lot, adding to this tedium.

This metroidvania has stronger RPG elements than most, and while it has some challenging boss fights, there are none that can't easily be solved by running away and gaining a few levels first. You have a choice of six different weapon styles to use, and many, many weapons of each type to collect. You'll mostly settle on a primary and a secondary depending on your play style (I mostly ran with dual daggers for quick attacks and whip for good anti-air), so the rest are kind of useless?

The game's hand-drawn art is gorgeous, especially the lush backgrounds in each area. This was also a bit of a problem though as sometimes I would assume background art was a platform I could step on when it wasn't. And sometimes foreground art, while admittedly a good aesthetic choice, will obstruct your view of combat. 

The game's story was very opaque for me. The backstory is complicated, involving a war between humans and some godlike entities long ago, and you are mostly dropped in there without explanation and random terms are just mentioned in conversation with little context and I still have no idea who some of the major antagonists are supposed to be. Also, the fact that this was developed by a Chinese team was obvious in some places due to poor translation or word/phrasing choices; it wasn't a lot but enough to jar me.

The game has multiple endings and I kind of just ran into my first one accidentally because the game just had so many random boss fights that I thought I was fighting one of those and was surprised when I got a cutscene afterwards. I had to use a walkthrough for the other endings. Completing two particular endings unlocked "New Game+", which is not what you'd expect. It's actually a chapter-select series of 10 missions where you play a different character whose story runs in parallel with the main one (and you see that character at different points in the main story). Completing the NG+ endings unlocks the "true ending" in the main game. Because of the story's opaqueness was and tediousness of the backtracking I probably would not have been able to figure most of this out without a walkthrough.

### Completion

I did not bother with completion on this one and just played enough to get most (all? I'm not even sure!) of the endings. Getting achievement completion would have required grinding to get to level 99 (took me forever just to get to 80+, and the game does not provide any higher-level enemies than that) and gathering a lot more money to purchase everything from all the shops, collecting all of the possible items, etc. I just wasn't that into the game.

Total playtime: 28.6 hours

Achievements: 32/46.

### Summary

Overall a decent and gorgeous metroidvania with a massive map; I enjoyed most of my playthrough but the late game just got too tedious for me.
