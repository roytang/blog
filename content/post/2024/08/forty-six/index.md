I didn't really have anything planned for this post, so I'm kind of just going to ramble about different things for a while. Most of the things [I wrote about last year still hold true](/2023/08/forty-five/). Time continues to be weird. The past year has been challenging.

### Letting Go Of Things

I recently came to the realization that I am bad at letting go of things. This is probably something I learned and/or inherited from my dad. I'm not saying this is necessarily a bad thing or that it makes me in any way unique. I think a certain percentage of people just prefer clinging on to things as much as they can while others can just so easily forget about things and move on and not even care about that sort of thing. (See also [I Have a Terrible Memory. Am I Better Off That Way?](/2024/06/ee5dd334dd298c6b4614f8c9b4465bd7/)) 

(I think there's also some level of privilege involved. I generally had a happy, uncomplicated life from childhood, so it seems more natural for me to want to retain memories than say someone who grew up in a broken household or had some major tragedy in their life.)

I find this realization fascinating because it just explains so many things! It explains [the pack rat mentality](/2007/12/pack-rat-mentality/), my attitude towards [ephemeral social media](/2019/08/ephemeral/) and [deleting old content](/2021/06/deleting-old-content/), all the backups and blogging and journalling and logging of things so I don't forget, [holding on to petty grudges from childhood](/2018/07/10156766321498912/), dwelling on my own mistakes from more than a decade ago, [the difficulty accepting the limits of mortality](/2023/12/being-mortal/), and so on and so forth. 

I think it's easy to want to cling to the past especially as we grow older, because for most of us, our younger days represented a simpler time, when we were less exposed to and less weary of the world's problems. (See also: [Things were simpler before we were woke](/2019/05/things-were-simpler/))

I don't think clinging to the past is necessarily bad, as long as it's not taken to an extreme. There are after all many hard-earned lessons to be learned from experience. And knowing about this tendency helps me frame things moving forward, to make sure I'm not clinging on to things too hard.

### The Main Timeline

My friends and I sometimes talk about things we would like to do if we ever had a "New Game+" in life. What that means is basically a chance to re-live life from a past point (usually around high school in our case) except retaining all our knowledge from the present day. It's a silly thing to fantasize about but probably pretty common. As one of my friends recently said: "There's always people looking back for a chance to do over some part of their life."

I was thinking about this because just before sitting down to write this entry, I had read a post by Ben Werdmuller (link: [Rebasing to reality](https://werd.io/2024/rebasing-to-reality)) that kind of resonated with me. Mr Werdmuller is roughly the same age as I am and he was talking about a sense of being disconnected with reality. 

> I had a conversation with a good friend recently. I told her that I felt like I was living in a branch in the timestream, and I was waiting for the world to snap back to the main timeline.
> 
> “Ben,” she patiently told me, “this is the main timeline.”
> 

...

> After her loss, I fell into a trough of feeling like nothing at all mattered, like I was disconnected from the cause and effect of reality. It was all a dream.
> 
> It was not a dream. This is the main timeline.

Repeating that one more time for my own benefit: *This is the main timeline*.

While it can be fun to cling to the past and fantasize about how we could have done things differently, we don't live in the past or in those alternate timelines. We live in this one. And while we can imagine things we could have done better in the past, we need to make sure we don't lose sight of the things we need to do in the present to ensure a better future. This is the reality we have to live in now, so we need to take care of it and nurture it so that future us will have less need to look back and want to change things (I suspect future me will still do that, humans are never satisfied.)

### The Ordinary Life

I was reading old birthday posts, and [the one from fifteen years ago](/2009/08/thirty-one/) struck me because I still had a lot of ambition then and was talking about stuff like my dreams and how I didn't want to live an ordinary life. Looking back at that version of me, I can see clearly that what dreams I had then weren't super specific. Even the wording in that post was super vague. I talk about "brainstorming business ideas" but I didn't really have a clue back then. I never really had a very specific passion for anything, just a kind of vague ambition about wanting to do something great. Maybe the most passionate dream I had growing up was becoming a [gamedev](/tags/gamedev/), but even there I wasn't super-specific about the kind of game I wanted to make and my ideas would constantly shift based on what new thing I encountered.

I wrote:

> For many people, this ordinary life may be enough, and that's great for them. They will live out their ordinary lives with their ordinary ending and grow old and raise their kids and enjoy the company of their grandchildren and they'll be completely happy and satisfied with that.
> 
> Again, I was never one for being so easily satisfied.
>

And it's funny to read this stuff now because honestly that ordinary life sounds great. Today's version of me just wants to chill and enjoy life and not have too many things to worry about.

Who knows what I'll be thinking of this post fifteen years from now?

### Open World

I'm not sure what comes next. This has been my status quo for about a year now. Just winging it with my ordinary life. Trying to find a way forward. Maybe next year will bring some clarity.
