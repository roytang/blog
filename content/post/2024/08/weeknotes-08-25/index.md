This entry is coming in a day late because I was busy yesterday.

### The World

Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have formally accepted their party's nominations at the DNC. Trump ranted a lot.

### My Week

Only 3 working days this week, but that just meant less time to get my errands done.

Monday: Quezon City holiday. A strong thunderstorm in the afternoon made us lose power for an hour or so, which led to me digging through old boxes to look at stuff leading to some real-life inventory-taking.

Tuesday: Spent most of the morning getting some paperwork done. It actually didn't take as long as I expected, I suspect because I went really early. In the afternoon I submitted my visa application and my status is now AWAITING JUDGMENT. 

Wednesday: Had a weird dream that was probably the result of binging manga and playing too much Snap. Brought the patient to the hospital for tests. Had to pay online for some meds. Teleconsult for the other patient in the afternoon. In the evening I had to buy some other meds and afterwards took a long walk before heading back home.

Thursday: Was exhausted from the previous day, so we decided to do our grocery run late in the day. Also had to get test results.

Friday: Holiday moved here from Wednesday. Chilled out mostly.

Saturday: Lunch out with one of the bros and fam, plus an errand to fix the car. In the afternoon, a different bro and fam hung out at home and helped the patient with some concerns. I attended Mass with only 4yo Nephew #3 as company, but he was pretty well-behaved.

On the blog: Wrote about [Mobile Banking](/2024/08/mobile-banking/) and also [a new Complete Marvel Run post](/2024/08/cmr-heroes-reborn/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Kinda frustrated with **Transformers: Fall of Cybertron**; might switch to a lower difficulty and give up on completion, or just maybe abandon it altogether? There are many other games to play.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Only did off-stream Bloomburrow drafts this week. I had a pretty good week in Snap though.
  
- **Reading**: I binged a new manga, *Dandadan*; I read 160+ issues over a few days and am now stuck waiting for new chapters. Still reading comics of course. Queued up some new books to read.

- **Watching**: This weeked I watched some 2024 films: [Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/ghostbusters-frozen-empire/) and [Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/furiosa-a-mad-max-saga/).

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 60,283 steps. After two straight weeks of missing the quota, I decided to let myself off easy this week and skip a day's worth of steps (actually two half-days in practice). There were two holidays this week after all!

### This Coming Week

Monday (today) is a holiday, capping off a 4-day weekend.

We should have had an immunotherapy session scheduled today but because of the holiday it was moved to Tuesday. Then we probably have another unrelated checkup on Friday.

Trivia team is attending a quiz night on Wednesday, I may or may not join.
