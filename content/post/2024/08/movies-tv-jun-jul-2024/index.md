### Movies

Managed to cram a bunch of movies into the last weekend of the month.

#### Burn After Reading (2008)

Watched on 2024-06-14: ★★★★

{{% photos burn-after-reading-2008 %}}

 This was a surprisingly good comedy-of-errors kind of film where nothing important is actually at stake but everyone involved is kind of moronic and all stumble into terrible situations. The most relatable character is JK Simmons' CIA Officer who can't make heads or tails of the whole affair and just wants to be rid of it!

#### Godzilla Minus One (2023)

Watched on 2024-06-16: ★★★★★



{{% photos godzilla-minus-one-2023 %}}

 The lead actor here reminds me of Smokey Manaloto.

This was sooo good. Nothing especially surprising about the plot, but everything is just executed so well. Gives us a good peek at what it was like for the survivors in Japan just after the war. Maybe a tad too much drama, but that's what it's all about isn't it? Post-war trauma, survivor's guilt, all of that. Oh yeah, and the big giant monster. He doesn't actually appear that often in the movie, but every single time it's just outstanding and often mouth-agape terrifying.

#### The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)

Watched on 2024-06-20: ★★★½



{{% photos the-life-aquatic-with-steve-zissou-2004 %}}

 This was fine. I liked a lot of the little details like the guy singing Bowie songs in Portuguese, the consistent use of no-fourth-wall boat sets, the petty rivarly with JG and other things. Also pleasant surprise at Matthew Grab Gubler randomly being in this film. The overall plot felt kinda silly, which is fine.

Mildly annoyed by the Filipino pirates with terrible Filipino accents. It sounds like they found some guys who didn't actually speak the language and just had them learn the dialogue by rote.

#### Jason Bourne (2016)

Watched on 2024-06-23: ★★★



{{% photos jason-bourne-2016 %}}

 Kinda annoyed that they killed off a character from the original trilogy in the first third of the movie. I thought they were priming Alicia Vikander's character to be a replacement for the same role, but in the end she turned out different. The rest of it felt kind of filler.

#### Godzilla vs. Kong (2021)

Watched on 2024-07-16: ★★★½



{{% photos godzilla-vs-kong-2021 %}}

 Plot was kinda predictable, though I still enjoyed the big monsters bashing against each other. We are moving further along the axis of humans gaining more agency and becoming the villains themselves. Kind of ridiculous that the kid was able to secretly able to teach Kong to communicate with sentences more complicated than "Kong wanna go home". Kinda disappointed how the titular matchup turned out.

#### Godzilla × Kong: The New Empire (2024)

Watched on 2024-07-24: ★★★½



{{% photos godzilla-kong-the-new-empire-2024 %}}

 This was fine to watch, but not great in the background because there's a lot of nonverbal communication going on. I am still mildly annoyed that one of the human stars is a conspiracy theorist podcaster guy. None of this makes any sense but seeing giant monsters duking it out and destroying major cities in the process is still entertaining.

I'm not sure how many more of these monsterverse movies they can do though; the sheer insanity of the scientific discoveries unlocked and the amount of devastation in each movie really stretches the idea that their world and society can still be so similar to ours.

#### Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)

Watched on 2024-07-25: ★★★★



{{% photos deadpool-wolverine-2024 %}}

 Fun movie, lots of fan service, don't think about the plot too much. Very much a love letter to the fans and a decent send-off and tribute to the Fox universe of Marvel films. 

Despite the internet's best efforts at clickbait spoilery headlines, the movie still managed to surprise me. The cameos are not just cameos this time and get some decent airtime.

I am not sure where Deadpool goes from here.

#### Morbius (2022)

Watched on 2024-07-27: ★★½



{{% photos morbius-2022 %}}

 This wasn't even that bad given it's reputation, it's just... very mediocre, predictable and boring. I am struggling to think of a good thing to say about it. Matt Smith is here, so that's nice I guess? IDK if that post-credits scene is going anywhere.

#### The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)

Watched on 2024-07-28: ★★★★



{{% photos the-secret-life-of-walter-mitty-2013 %}}

 I enjoyed this one much more than I expected. A beautifully shot, feel-good movie. Made me think about life for a bit. While I was watching I was thinking I hope they don't end this in a horrible way with a plot twist I was imagining. I'm happy to say they didn't and the movie played it straight.

#### Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018)

Watched on 2024-07-28: ★★★½



{{% photos jurassic-world-fallen-kingdom-2018 %}}

 This is largely more of the same: Greedy humans biting off more than they can chew to disastrous consequences. Some of the action sequences with an enhanced velociraptor hunting down Chris Pratt and friends through an empty museum echoes the first movie. Kind of a darker tone, with a more sinister implication for what lies ahead for humans in this universe. Hey, Jeff Goldblum is back!

#### Crank (2006)

Watched on 2024-07-29: ★★★



{{% photos crank-2006 %}}

 Watched this because it was leaving Netflix. This is like the movie Speed, except the bus is Jason Statham. The plot is nothing incredible, but it is a rush. I would have titled it "Adrenaline Rush" or something like that.

### TV

#### The Boys S4

★★★½

This was still fine watching and still the same shocking tone that keeps trying to push boundaries. But I felt a bit uncomfortable with how closely the show's events mirror real-life and it kinda made me sad for the US. (Reminder: I am not an Aemrcian)

#### The Acolyte

★★★

This had a promising start, but they kind of dragged out the show's mysteries a bit too much and even then we didn't even get a lot of real answers at the end. But at least we got cameo fan service!

I kind of had trouble with Sol's actor's diction and I found out later that this was his first English-speaking role so I guess that's kind of understandable and maybe even a bit astounding all things considered, but I feel like if an actor isn't used to English it might have been better to ramp up with some lesser roles first instead of jumping straight into a lead role with so much dialogue.

#### My Adventures with Superman S2

★★★★

This continues to be very good (and very anime), and the introduction of Kara/Supergirl just makes things better. We learn more about what happened to Krypton and in fact see more of the universe outside Earth. Looks like we're setting up for Lex Luthor as the major villain next season!

#### Abbott Elementary S3

★★★½

Still decent background watching. Lots of celebrity cameos this time. At least they finally resolved the whole will-they-wont-they shenanigans.

#### Gravity Falls

★★★★★

I've been meaning to watch this ever since I read [this tweet/thread from creator Alex Hirsch detailing the ridiculous things Disney would attempt to censor from the show](https://twitter.com/_AlexHirsch/status/1537314312926003201). Noticed a few weeks ago that it was on Disney+ and binged through both seasons pretty quickly.

*Gravity Falls* is sooo good! It is absolutely a kids' show, with themes of belonging, growing up, leaving childhood behind, etc. But it is also insanely funny and clever and self-aware and the mythology the shows builds is just amazing. Season 1 starts off pretty much with a mystery-of-the-week that serves to introduce us to the setting of the town of Gravity Falls and it's eccentric residents and many mysterious happenings. Towards the end of the season the continuity ramps up quickly as we lead into season two where Dipper and Mabel finally unearth the answers to the mysteries plagueing them all summer.

All the characters are great too, not just the main cast, but every one of Gravity Falls' kooky residents brings a little bit of charm to the ensemble. Linda Cardellini as Wendy is the best though.

I watched the latest and greatest genre series over the past couple of months but the best thing I saw is probably still this decade-old kids' cartoon!
