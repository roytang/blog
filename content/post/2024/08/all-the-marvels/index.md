The complete title of this book is "All of the Marvels: A Journey to the Ends of the Biggest Story Ever Told". I first heard of this book [back in early 2022](/2022/01/weeknotes-01-23/#links-of-interest) and reading about it directly inspired my own [complete-marvel-run](/tags/complete-marvel-run/). (For that reason I attach that same tag to this book review.)

First off: I enjoyed the book a lot, obviously because I am already into the source material anyway. I tore through it in a couple of weeks, which is pretty quick for me nowadays.

That being said, I was disappointed in a few ways.

First: his scope was a bit smaller than I expected; his declared scope is from 1961's *Fantastic Four #1* (a reasonable starting point) and ends with 2017's *Marvel Legacy #1*. That means there have already been 7 years of comics out since then! (The book does cover some of the post-2017 comics though). He claims to have read 27,000 books overall, and the current count of Marvel published books is well over 34,000.

Second: I was hoping he would talk a bit about how he managed to track that he had read every single issue in his scope and how long his attempt took, as that is something that concerns me during my own attempt. It sounds like he has been reading a lot of comics since his childhood (also true for me, though probably to a lesser extent as I mostly stuck to Spider-Man/X-Men stories until the mid-2000s or so), and there is no detail on how he made sure he read every issue in that scope.

Lastly: The book claims to be a "tour guide" of sorts to the Marvel Universe, offering possible entry points and paths through the single largest piece of continuous, self-contained fiction in history, a prospect which can be daunting to the uninitiated. He correctly posits that there is no one valid entry point or true path through the story. Nor is it a good idea to "start at the beginning"; he suggests jumping around to points of interest whenever possible and most of the chapters highlight specific characters, teams or storylines that might be of interest to follow. 

This book works for me because I'm already enfranchised in this world, but I think it won't really help the uninitiated who wants to get into the world of comics (perhaps due to exposure to the movies). The advice of "just pick a starting point and jump around to wherever you like" sounds straightforward, but for people new to this world, that is probably a bit too much choice given 60+ years of Marvel comics history. Granted the question of "where should I start reading Marvel comics" is a nontrivial one that largely depends on which characters or kinds of stories interest you and how much interconnectedness you are looking for; I don't think it's something that can be simplified into a 400-page book.

Still, as mentioned I did enjoy the book and reading the chapters that covered those characters/storylines I had yet to run across on my own attempt has just made me more excited for when I eventually get there. If you have even a passing interest in Marvel comics, it's probably worth the read.
