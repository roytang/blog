I had not yet read any Murakami before so I thought I'd give this one a try, supposedly it is one of his best ones. I am not sure I would read any others. The story is good and entertaining but there are just soooo many things left unexplained! I like my fantasy with intricately explained magic systems, not mysterious otherworldly wells that are never explained and characters named after European islands who just vanish completely after some point.

To be fair, I did enjoy many of the the little side stories in the book like the stories of the war, the interactions with neighbor girl May Kasahara (probably my favorite character in the book), and so on. There are a lot of whimsical little details that added some good flavor.

Took me a while to get through this book, something like 2-3 months. My first impression is that it wasn't very long, but that was probably because each chapter is very short. I mostly just read a chapter or two whenever I was waiting somewhere or in a long queue.
