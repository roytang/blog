### The World

US VP Kamala Harris has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her VP Candidate for the upcoming US Elections. [Tim Walz fixed your bicycle](https://timwalzfixedyourbicycle.com/).

Ukraine troops have invaded Russian borders! I like to imagine Putin with a :surprisedpikachu: face like "They can do that to us too?!?"

### My Week

Had a fun family get-together last Sunday to celebrate this week's birthdays and also welcome back to the country some relatives we haven't seen since before the pandemic. So many people in the house! I take the opportunity to show [some old photographs](/2023/04/old-photographs/) those always go over well for the nostalgia factor.

Monday was immunotherapy day. I always get a lot of reading done on these days.

The rest of the week was kind of lax on the "taking care of the parents" front and I had time to get around to the rare errand for myself. Namely, I had to get documents together for a visa I need for a trip later this year. This involved a lot of visiting different banks to get certifications that I am not a nefarious ne'er do well and am indeed a proud and productive contributor to our (ugh) capitalist society. 

On the blog: I wrote [the birthday post](/2024/08/forty-six/)! It was a bit rambly.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I have been aggressively playing **Afterimage** on Steam and honestly I'm kinda tired of it already and am close to done with the game. I might not even bother with completion for this one.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. 
  
- **Reading**: I am 40% through the current book. It is about comics! I have also been reading a bunch comics.

- **Watching**: Finished watching all 10 eps of **Batman: Caped Crusader** on Prime Video; it is fairly good. Also watched [Hit Man (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/hit-man-2023/) on Netflix.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,132 steps. Target achieved! TBH I almost missed Saturday but was able to overcome my laziness.

### This Coming Week

More errands, etc.

We are probably attending a quiz night on Wednesday.

I am expecting / hoping some documents I have been waiting for finally get processed this week.
