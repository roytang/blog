The other day I was woken up by a call from someone from my local bank branch informing me that I needed to switch to the new version of their mobile app and the old version would not be useful. This is the same new mobile app that they had been spamming me with notifications for the past couple of months or so with copious warnings across SMS, email and viber that the old mobile app was about to be deprecated and that I should switch over to the new one. The caller said they received an email with a list of clients that needed to be called to follow-up on this, which made me realize that hey, they weren't being insistently spammy to all their clients, I might have been targetted by those notifications!

She started to give me a spiel about how I would no longer be able to use the old mobile app, and I quickly interrupted to tell her that I do not actually use the old mobile app. This stunned her momentarily so I explained that I only use the web app on desktop, and she recovered enough to try to sell me on the new mobile app, saying I could just use the same credentials etc (a friend later told me this was not true and that he had to specify new creds!) and I just politely said something to the effect of "Okay, thanks and bye!"

This all feels to me like some higher-up wasn't happy with their numbers for the new mobile app adoption, enough to authorize the spammy notification scheme and later even emailing the branches to talk to specific clients. While discussing all of this, a friend tells me that "These banks keep changing apps, and the newer app is always worse off than the current one!"

I personally prefer not to use mobile banking apps. In general, I prefer not to use mobile apps when a perfectly serviceable web app exists.

I have nothing against people who use mobile banking apps - I acknowledge they are *probably* more secure than just using the web app on mobile, and that most people will only have a phone to do their online banking on. But as a desktop PC user, I have better options.

I dislike using mobile banking apps for several reasons:

- my phone is inherently a much less secure device than my desktop because someone else can easily gain access to it (or [it can get stolen](/2023/07/stolen-phone/))
- any online banking decisions should be made in the sober confines of your home and not susceptible to the impulsive "I can transfer money whereever I am!" reach of your mobile phone
- it is just much, much to use a PC than a phone in terms of inputs, multi-tasking, etc. I can just copy-paste account numbers instead of relying on kludges like QR codes (although this does make it annoying when someone sends me a QR code instead of an account number)

I do still need my phone for 2FA when doing my online banking via my PC, but that is a much simpler thing to be done. 

I realize SMS is generally regarded as a less secure method of 2FA, but most online banking sites over here do not support authenticator apps. 

A recent trend did make me install mobile banking apps however: it's the addition of the so-called "mobile app key" requirement for certain transactions like third-party transfers. The mobile app key is basically an SMS replacement where you nominate a specific device that has the mobile app installed and when you need to transact via the web app, the app will give your phone a push notif and you tap it and then type a PIN to authorize the transaction.

In theory, I understand why this would be more secure: "a password, a PIN and a separate device" is inherently better than "a passowrd and an SMS on a separate device", since if your phone is compromised the attacker can get the SMS, but can't get a PIN. In practice however, the mobile app can be buggy (the push notification doesn't always come up), and if I take too long, the web app gives me the option of an SMS fallback anyway!

I have begrudgingly accepted this one mobile banking app into my banking routines (and it has even proven useful on occasion). Recently another bank (not the one from the first story in this post; I have many banks for reasons that will remain mysterious) has started requiring a mobile app key as well; I have also begrudgingly set it up but have yet to require it, so IDK how terrible it will be.

In conclusion: one final annoyance: online banking web apps that do not have feature parity with their mobile app counterparts. Don't discriminate against web users!
