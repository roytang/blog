It has been a week. Somehow the month is halfway through already. The past week have seen hotter days, with only a slight sprinkling of rains in the evenings, which I suspect just made the following days worse due to humidity.

### My Week

Sunday: Some of the *pamangkins* came over to visit. They continue to be bad at video games.

Monday: Teleconsult for one of the parents; his numbers weren't very good and we had to do increased monitoring and another follow-up teleconsult next week.

Wednesday: I had to get a Grab to bring the parents to a meet-up dinner they had in Cubao; luckily I happened to be going to the same area as well. [We won a quiz night](/2024/08/popquiz-sports/)! Our Grab driver lived nearby and said he recognized me from all my walkabouts. I'm famous!

Thursday: Grocery day. Mildly annoyed at our *suking* grocery because the past few weeks they have been renovating some sections and re-arranging things and that just makes things harder to find!

Friday: One of the parents had a new issue and we had to consult with a new doctor and this one took way longer than we expected because the doctor wanted to run some tests and we were at the hospital most of the day and I was just exhausted when I got home. I was able to get some paperwork done while I was there though.

Throughout the week I was also putting together the last few requirements for my visa application and working on some stuff for the website.

On the blog: Just a couple of review posts (which is most of what I seem to write lately), see below.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: I finished playing Afterimage and [wrote a review](http://localhost:8000/2024/08/afterimage/)! I also started playing a shooty game from 2012 which is super out of character, but it's actually **Transformers: Fall of Cybertron** so that explains it.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Bloomburrow drafting has been going reasonably well; there is [a YT playlist of my drafts so far](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXimBbVvzhx_Kh8V_5wDoeb9) if that's your thing.
  
- **Reading**: I finished a book and [wrote a review](/2024/08/all-the-marvels/)! Also still reading more comics, etc.

- **Watching**: Finally watched [Madame Web (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/madame-web/) on Netflix.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,136 steps. It feels like a goddamn miracle whenever I manage to hit these. Last Thursday I had to do all ten thousand steps like three hours before midnight!

    > "Making genuine novelty is all too often career suicide. We could have so much more, so much more variety and diversity, if we weren’t so utterly dominated by an economic system that values homogeneity and marketability over all. Which is why I get angry when people in tech – almost always in tech – talk as if novelty and creativity is rare. It isn’t. It’s stifled and unfunded."

### This Coming Week

Couple of holidays this coming week, but that only makes the working day errands a bit tighter since we only have 3 days to get them done.

Monday is a holiday for us in Quezon City. Wednesday was originally supposed to be a holiday (Ninoy Aquino day), but the government has moved the day off to Friday instead (holiday economics, etc).

Most of my upcoming week plans revolve around errands (as usual): submitting my visa application, prep work for the immunotherapy the week after, and a teleconsult for the other parent. At least Monday and Friday should not be very busy.
