### My Week

My week was relatively lighter errand-wise. I still had stuff to do of course, but this time it was mostly just the routine stuff we need to do everytime there's an upcoming immunotherapy session. Oh, and one scheduled checkup where we had to come back later in the week because after waiting for a couple of hours suddenly the doctor was unable to come. (We understand of course, but it's still inconvenient!)

After 3 years of subscribing to the NYT Crossword/Games, I accidentally broke my current crossword streak when I forgot to do the crossword last Monday. Oops! That was a 1000+ day streak, I won't be able to recover that until 2027! Well, might as well just share my current stats here:

Note that my average times might be a bit skewed low as I often do the crossword with friends. I still don't know how that 1:02 Monday time happened though.

Online trading company **eToro** announced they are pulling back PH operations and that I have to close my account. I assume this is because [the SEC issued an advisory against them earlier this year](https://www.sec.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024Advisory-Against-eTORO.pdf). I've been using it in small amounts over the past few years to do some day trading which I've discovered I am very bad at; I jokingly say I can predict when markets will rise because it happens whenever I close my positions. Anyway, the shutdown comes at an inconvenient time as I'm pretty sure I'm still net negative overall. I basically paid money to learn I am bad at this. They said I can keep my account open until the first of December, but I decided to just start the withdrawal procedure already so I don't have to think of it later. 

We [attended a quiz night last Tuesday](/collections/quiznights/triviadown-videogames) on short notice, but did not win.

On the blog: wrote [my much-delayed Bloomburrow set recap](/2024/10/bloomburrow/). Hoping to write more this coming week!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a bunch of **Starfield** and **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom**. I am starting to get a bit tired of Starfield though and am considering whether I will even still bother with completion.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap** and a bit of **Street Fighter VI**. For Duskmourn drafting, have switched to doing quick drafts off-stream, as it's always a hassle for me to find a good contiguous block of time to stream drafts anyway. I have been doing reasonably well, probably a bit better than the last set anyway.
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics. I am behind on my comics-related posts!

- **Watching**: Finally binged **Agatha All Along** this past week, it is good. I believe one more ep remains this coming week. Also, **Dandadan** and the **Ranma 1/2** remake seem ok so far. This anime season is kind of interesting for me because Dragonball Daima is also coming out on Netflix this week!

### Walking and Health

From Oct 06 (Sunday) to Oct 12 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 65,663 steps. Only slightly better than last week, as usual it is towards the end of the week that I got lazy. I technically had time to push it a bit more on Saturday night, but an irrational part of me didn't want to risk ending the week with like 66,666 steps or such. (Or probably it was just laziness!)
