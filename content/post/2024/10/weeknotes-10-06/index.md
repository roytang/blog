It is October! Time marches relentlessly forward, and 2024 nears its end.

### My Week

I had a busy week, lots of medical errands and paperwork and end-of-month things to attend to. I think I had to go the hospital on 3 out of 5 weekdays during the week, mostly for paperwork stuff, but also to get some test results we've been waiting for and have been really anxious about and I am happy to report we got a favorable outcome and heaved a collective sigh of relief as a family that things weren't going to get worse. Not much else to say about it except that I got more exhausted as the week wore on.

Some family meet-ups over the weekend. Niece #4 is having her birthday early next week so we had an early celeb.

On the blog: wrote [my latest every-two-months compilation of movie and TV reviews](/2024/10/movies-tv-aug-sep-2024/). There's a bunch of other stuff that needs to be written!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a bunch of **Starfield**. Also managed to start playing through **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** already, although my Switch is starting to show its age and the joycons and hdmi output have been givingme trouble that needed to be debugged.
    - I also found out that Prime Gaming dropped a whole bunch of free games on the service and Square even dropped a couple of Mana games on PC Game Pass. So many games to play! (IDK if I will ever get around to those!)
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap** and a bit of **Street Fighter VI**. Have not yet found much time to do Duskmourn drafting.
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics. And read through some classic manga, I should write a manga post at some point.

- **Watching**: Huh I don't think I watched any new stuff last week. Nothing worth mentioning yet anyway. The Dandadan pilot episode was super weird; that's to be expected given the manga, but the animation style was kind of wilder than what I expected.

### Walking and Health

From Sep 29 (Sunday) to Oct 05 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 61,110 steps. I admittedly got lazy on Friday and Saturday after all the errands I've been doing and did not push to hit the targets. I did do a check of my yearly step total so far, and we are still mostly on track to beat last year's total though, which is pretty good!

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

More of the regular medical checkups and follow-ups and hopefully no more big surprises.

There are probably other things to look forward to but I'm kind of too tired/sleepy to think about them now!
