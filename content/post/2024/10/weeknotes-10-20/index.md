### My Week

A bit of lighter week this time errand-wise. Had an immunotherapy session early in the week; mostly I just sit around at these things or walk around getting my steps at the hospital. This time there was some paperwork to handle. There was also an unscheduled doctor consult later in the week; just something the patient had been putting off and finally scheduled.

The lighter schedule meant I was able to get back to some tasks and personal projects that had been left to the wayside because of the general busy-ness of the past month. Feels good to be productive, even though none of it is anything I feel like talking about publicly.

It's been a long time coming, but I have deactivated my Twitter accounts! There were like 3 bot accounts I was using for various purposes, and a secondary account I used to use for MTG-related tweets back in the day. For my main twitter account, I waffled on it a bit before finally going ahead and deactivating it just now. I haven't used it for a while and I have an archive of everything, but I hesitated for a couple of days because of the sheer amount of [link rot](/2021/02/link-rot/) it would create on this site! (Also I am very bad at just letting things go...) I have links out to individual tweets for each one archived on the site. I figure if it really bothers me, in the future I can use some URL rewriting magic to redirect any such outbound links to an archived version. It's still super annoying that it has come to this thanks to Elon Musk!

On the blog: I wrote about [some recent webcomics](/2024/10/recent-webcomics/) and [website gardening](/2024/10/website-gardening/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a bunch of **Starfield** and **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom**. I am unlikely to push Starfield to completion and am currently just pushing the main quest til I finish it. 
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap** and a bit of **Street Fighter VI**.
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics. I am still behind on my comics-related posts!

- **Watching**: I was wrong last week; **Agatha All Along** is apparently 9 episodes instead of the 6 I was thinking, so this week's episode is the 2/3rd mark. Also started watching **Superman and Lois** S3; am behind by 1 season as S4 is already ongoing, but I expect to finish both seasons this year. The final throes of the Arrowverse!

### Walking and Health

From Oct 13 (Sunday) to Oct 19 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 63,783 steps. I also had a bit more than 2,000 steps that Google Fit doesn't know about because I went on a walkabout early in the week and forgot to bring my phone, oops. That brings us around to the same total as last week. Saturday is the weak spot as usual, but I am a bit more forgiving of myself these days and I think having one lax day a week isn't going to kill me.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

Looks like the rare errand-free week ahead. So far at least; they have a habit of sneaking in at the last moment! Might manage to be a bit productive this coming week.

Trivia team is planning to attend at least one quiz night this week.

Next weekend is Magic Con Las Vegas! Expecting some cool announcements etc.
