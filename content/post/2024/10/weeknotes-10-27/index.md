### My Week

Very light week errand-wise, so I had the opportunity to work on some side projects and also updates for this website that I hope to deploy and make public before the year is out. (My pace is very slow.)

Typhoone Kristine tore through the island of Luzon during the second half of the week. We weren't as badly hit as other areas even though there was a lot of rain and wind and at some point I worried about what looked a leak that might appear in my ceiling but it was a false alarm. (Probably?)

We were planning to attend a quiz night Wednesday, but it got postponed to the next week for non-storm related reasons. We considered another quiz night on Thursday, but ultimately decided not to go, this time for storm-related reasons.

Most of Saturday was spent in a family get-together, where I somehow managed to give myself a new source of anxiety.

On the blog: Nothing much this week, other than the weeknotes.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a bunch of **Starfield** and **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom**, I think both games are in the "endgame" stage now, or close to it, but I am still cleaning up missing quests, etc. I am travelling later in November and and hoping to be done with these games before them and post reviews already.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, a bit of **Street Fighter VI**, and even the occasional **Eternal Card Game** still, the game that refuses to die.
    - Lots of definitely exciting MTG-related announcements came out of MagicCon Las Vegas this weekend, a lot of which will be very concerning for the old-school Magic audience. I don't think Magic is goona die anytime soon, but it is definitely changing into a form that many old-school players might not like.
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics. I am still behind on my comics-related posts!

- **Watching**: No new movies watched this week, but I am keeping with a lot of TV recently. A pleasant surprise: new **Lower Decks** season started this week! Other things I'm trying to keep up with: **Dandadan**, **Dragonball Daima**, **Ranma 1/2**, **Agatha All Along**, **Superman & Lois**. 

### Walking and Health

From Oct 20 (Sunday) to Oct 27 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 38,145 steps. Unfortunately, the storm tearing through Metro Manila made it hard to keep up my daily walks. In theory I could have gone out with an umbrella, but the rains and winds were strong enough that it would have been a big bother and I'm always worried about slipping on some wet surface and dying a stupid death. Hopefully we can recover this week, though I think another storm is expected to come in?

### Some Links of Interest

- [Forget Gladwell](https://culture.ghost.io/forget-gladwell/)

    > "Picking on Gladwell, however, is a bit of a cliché, and I am often advised to keep quiet for a wide range of professional reasons. But he's unstoppable and incorrigible, and I don't believe he's harmless."

    > "Gladwell's bar for whether an idea is worth writing up in a mass market book is literally "I dunno, maybe this is something?""

    Lol I did read a few of Gladwell's books back in the day, but I think I kind of recognized them as more pop psychology than any sort of rigorous science.

- [How many hobbies is too many? • Buttondown](https://buttondown.com/monteiro/archive/how-many-hobbies-is-too-many/)

    > "Hobby is capitalism’s word. It’s a crumb from capitalism’s table. Capitalism is happy that you have a hobby, especially if it can sell you HO-scale train sets to complete it, but that hobby can never be taken as seriously as what capitalism might need from you."

- [The Other Bubble](https://www.wheresyoured.at/saaspocalypse-now/)

    In which Ed Zitron long-windedly blames SaaS for software being shitty and explains how that fuels the AI bubble.

    > "While not all Software-As-A-Service companies are parasites, the incentive for these companies is less about serving your needs and more about making sure they're so deeply embedded in your organization that they're impossible to remove."

    > "The reason I've spent so much energy explaining this is because I want you to know why so much business software fucking sucks. ...<snip>... and the reason it sucks is because this industry is built off the back of outpricing the competition, creating an inescapable gravitational pull on your organization and selling to people who don't actually use it."

    > "And the reason I've so agonizingly explained it is that I believe the current generative AI boom is almost entirely fueled by the hunger of the Software As A Service parasite for growth...and the slow collapse of growth in tech's favorite business model."

    Honestly just go read the whole thing!

- [Enterprise Philosophy and The First Wave of AI – Stratechery by Ben Thompson](https://stratechery.com/2024/enterprise-philosophy-and-the-first-wave-of-ai/)

    > "Benioff isn’t talking about making employees more productive, but rather companies; the verb that applies to employees is “augmented”, which sounds much nicer than “replaced”; the ultimate goal is stated as well: business results. That right there is tech’s third philosophy: improving the bottom line for large enterprises."

    > "And, by extension, we may be waiting longer than we expect for AI to take over the consumer space, at least at the scale of something like the smartphone or social media. That is good news for the MKBHDs of everything — the users with volition — but for everyone else the biggest payoff will probably be in areas like entertainment and gaming. True consumerization of AI will be left to the next generation who will have never known a world without it."

    > "Every text-first platform on the web right now is running up against an internet-wide literacy wall. Unless something truly miraculous happens, it is reasonable to assume that every day there will be fewer people reading words on the internet than there were the day before."

    > "But one day you’ll be the last person writing words on the web and wonder where everyone went."

    > "The paradox of technology is, the greater it understands us, the greater it can serve and protect us, and the greater it can exploit us."

    > "Rule one: When you invent a new technology, you uncover a new class of responsibility. Rule two: If the technology confers power, you start a race. And rule three: If you do not coordinate, that race will end in tragedy as you exploit that thing. "

    > "He pointed out that ChatGPT usage in the Philippines saw a dramatic 90 percent jump when the 2024 school year started, which only translates into how AI tools are becoming an integral part of daily life for students, educators, and professionals."

    Ugh, this is just going to make our education crisis so much worse.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

A friend's mom passed away (she was very old), I am planning to attend the wake early in the week.

The quiz night we missed last week was postponed to this Wednesday so we are probably attending that.

My brother and I might go watch the new Venom movie (reviews have been mixed I think).

Jeez, it's already November!
