### Set Notes

- My string of mediocre limited performance during the play booster era continues. I was actually doing pretty fine until the last few sessions tanked my win rate to a fairly average 54.55%
- I did enjoy the format, it was fairly fun and the overlap of mechanics and how cards fed multiple archetypes was interesting. 
- However, the primary complaint about this format is that it was very "on-rails" where each of the limited archetypes was very good, as long as you built them a certain way. If you diverged a bit or splashed for a random tricolor rare, you tended to get punished for it. Such was my experience.
- My stats were actually pretty decent in like 7/10 out of the draft archetypes, the others dragged me down!

### 7-x Draft Decks

My only trophy draft for this set is in BG which is probably one of my favorite archetypes in this set. This draft only had one rare, which just emphasizes how much I lose points due to my rare-drafting tendencies lol.

### Magic Arena Stats

{{% photos statsemail %}}

Zero boosters opened! I kept my BLB boosters unopened until Duskmourn season had already started, so I guess they weren't counted.

My play stats for this season were a lot lower than other standard sets because I had a lot of life interruptions during September especially, so I wasn't able to play as much as I'd have liked. I was even 4 levels short on completing the mastery pass!

### Paper Draft

On Aug 25 I played a modified paper draft  with some friends. Our format is more casual "draft 3 packs, then open 1 extra pack" draft+sealed combo. I built a RW deck, an archetype I never actually got to try in Arena! Sadly I didn't get a lot of the good RW valiant payoffs and only went 2-1 in the swiss, my one loss being to BG, my favorite archetype!

I'm drafting Duskmourn currently, but I'm travelling in November, so I might not actually have not a lot of time with that set before Foundations comes in late in the year.
