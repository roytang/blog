For some reason or another I've recently been fond of scrolling through Instagram's "Explore" page. Ever since Twitter died, it's been my only source of algorithmic content for doomscrolling or whatever. At some point, the algorithm started recommending webcomics to me and I started following some regularly. Here are the ones I have been enjoying recently.

### Crabgrass

Crabgrass is a 4-panel strip by [Tauhid Bondia](https://crabgrass.fun/) that focuses on two grade-school kids who are neighbors and best friends and get into wacky adventures. There is a strong focus on the kinds of wacky hijinks kids get into and it also has long story arcs that usually seem to involve some fantasy aspect. When I started reading it, I jumped onto a story arc where they were in a "Freaky Friday" situation. The next story arc was about a video game that turns kids into zombies. The current story arc seems to be about dyslexia and special education (I'm not sure yet if this one has any fantasy aspect). The zombie story arc was 62 strips long, and the current ones is indicated to be 71 strips long.

The strips aren't especially funny or insightful; I was kinda mostly drawn in by the ongoing story arcs and wanting to see what happens next.

I've been reading this one mostly via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/crabgrasscomic/), but just today I discovered that the primary release outlet is on [GoComics](https://www.gocomics.com/crabgrass) and the GoComics one seems to have Sunday strips that were not being released on Instagram. Unfortunately, I can't find a version that I can follow via RSS. Also, I tried reading a bit from the very beginning of the strip in 2019 from the GoComics archive and discovered two things: (a) the artist's style has drastically changed and improved since it started; and (b) the black kid was originally named Curtis, not Miles! Did he change the name somewhere in the middle? Or is Miles a completely different character? Maybe someday I'll go through the archives and find out!

### FieldExplores

This one is a super wholesome 4-panel comic about an anthromorphic father and son. I think they are crocodiles? Or alligators? The other characters they interact with are all different animals. I can't find any information about the author, but [the Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/fieldexplores/) says "I'm just your average video game enthusiast who draws lots of silly things."

I liked this one mostly because there's a lot of gaming-related things and specifically gags about older gamers. I think he started out doing pokemon-related strips. A lot of the stories are also about the kid crocodile (his name is Gustopher. GUSTOPHER!!) making friends with other kids and the dad having to deal with parenting and other issues.

The strip is also on other social media besides Instagram, but the best one is on [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/fieldexplores) since it has [an RSS feed](https://fieldexplores.tumblr.com/rss).

### Larkness 

My favorite one of this set. I titled this section based on [the Instagram profile](https://www.instagram.com/larkness_/), but I think the author is just called "Lark". The author is from Brazil and they have [a website](http://corvomateus.com/) but it is in Portuguese.

The strip itself is a 4-panel strip (this format is popular in Instagram) about birds who work in a corporate setting. They're not birds that look like humans, they're actual birds with wings instead of hands, etc. I have no idea how they use the human-sized laptops they use for work! They work for a company called Catch.co and the CEO is a cat, which should raise some eyebrows already. And they still live in a human world, the cat has a human "owner", IDK how it works, I just roll with it.

I like this one because there is a strong anticapitalist theme running through it. Catch.co is the kind of buzzwordy nonsense company MBA types think of and the CEO is all "hustle culture" and everything.

Each strip is posted to Instagram in both English and Portuguese and does not seem to be posted anywhere else (which is a bit annoying actually). This whole birds story looks like it has been going on for a couple of years or sosss, but I suspect the storyline might be nearing its end because the birds only recently discovered that the CEO is a PREDATOR!! Lol. So many real-life parallels!
