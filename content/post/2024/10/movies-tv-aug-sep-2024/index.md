#### Hit Man (2023)

Watched on 2024-08-08: ★★★½



{{% photos hit-man-2023 %}}

 Fairly enjoyable. This was a bit more rom-com than I expected and much less violent than I expected and had way more sex scenes than I expected (glad I didn't watch it with my mom!) but also the story took a darker turn than I thought it would. Glen Powell gives some good performances as both a boring cat parent and his fake alterego.

#### Madame Web (2024)

Watched on 2024-08-17: ★★½



{{% photos madame-web-2024 %}}

 It's still a mystery to me how this movie even got made; the source comic book character is hardly a superhero and more of a walking plot device than anything else. In this movie she largely performs the same function, which as it turns out is largely uninteresting. 

Dakota Johnson is kind of phoning it in here, she might have been miscast. I was a bit more entertained by her trying to pretend to know Marvel stuff when she did the press tour.

Her character is given very little reason to actually care about the three girls she has to save; same goes for the audience. And there is a bit of bait-and-switch there with the movie's marketing promising we're getting 3 different "Spider-Woman" characters but actually those are just visions of a possible future for those characters.

I do applaud the probably-demanded-by-higher-ups attempt to shoehorn the Parker connection in there somehow, and Adam Scott's very earnest young Ben Parker.

Overall: Maybe not egregiously bad, but not overly interesting either, even as a comic book fan.

#### Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire (2024)

Watched on 2024-08-19: ★★★½



{{% photos ghostbusters-frozen-empire-2024 %}}

 This was fun and I appreciate the attempts to link back to the original movie, but it falls short in several ways and feels like a shallow attempt to capitalize on nostalgia. I was a bit sad at Phoebe's character arc (the character deserved better). Especially weird for the people of NYC to be cheering them at the end since unlike the original they didn't resolve things in public.

#### Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga (2024)

Watched on 2024-08-22: ★★★★½



{{% photos furiosa-a-mad-max-saga-2024 %}}

 I was a bit iffy on this film since it was announced because I feel like ATJ is nothing like Charlize Theron, but by the end of it I was much more willing to believe she was playing the same badass and bloodied character. Hemsworth is barely recognizable here as the deranged dementus and his performance was outstanding. A fantastic film and worthy prequel that lifts up Fury Road as well.

{{% photos high-fidelity-2000 %}}

 I'm not big on romcoms, but I enjoyed this one. I liked the setting, the vibe, the mockumentary-like format, the music, the John Cusack perfomance, and Jack Black's scene-stealing energy

#### Poor Things (2023)

Watched on 2024-09-19: ★★★★



{{% photos poor-things-2023 %}}

 Setting aside the fact that Bella Baxter would have functionally had the mind of an infant/toddler for most of this film and the lots of very gratuitous sex that happens, this was kind of a fascinating look into how a person (such as she is) grapples with questions of identity and self-exploration and learning about the world and finds it in the unlikeliest of places. It is also quite a bizarre film. Emma Stone's performance was great of course, but I also enjoyed how deranged Mark Ruffalo's character became as time went by. What happened to that other guy near the end kind of felt out of place?

#### Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths Part One (2024)

Watched on 2024-09-19: ★★



{{% photos justice-league-crisis-on-infinite-earths-part-one- %}}

 I have read the original CoIE comics a bunch of times and a good amount of DC and know almost all of the characters who appeared in this trilogy; I am pretty much the target market for this, and I still found this to be a confusing mess! They way they divided it into 3 parts made no sense for me in terms of pacing and did not help with the confusion.

With so many characters introduced from different earths, it's hard to feel any sense of attachment or urgency to them. They tried to give some of them character arcs (like Batman finding out he was able to raise kids in other realities), but because of the large cast we spend so little time with each character it's hard to get attached.

I think this installment was the second best/worst of the trilogy, if only because it had the much more straightforward task of introducing the Justice League (well, A Justice League), but the whole "Flash experiencing everything out of linear order" bit just made it confusing. The Amazo part was much more interesting than everything else.

#### Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths Part Two (2024)

Watched on 2024-09-20: ★★



{{% photos justice-league-crisis-on-infinite-earths-part-two- %}}

 See my review of part one for general comments. I have less comments on this one because honestly it was more boring and I wasn't paying much attention and was doing other stuff. The shift in focus characters from part one felt a bit jarring. Easily the worst part of this trilogy.

#### Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths Part Three (2024)

Watched on 2024-09-21: ★★½



{{% photos justice-league-crisis-on-infinite-earths-part-thre %}}

 See my review of part one for more general comments. They took this adaptation in a weird direction, and decided to give Constantine a bigger role for some reason, and the pacing towards the end felt really weird; lots of talking while the Anti-Monitor was just going around devouring worlds. Most of the characters did not get good arcs or endings, maybe all of them. 

This story is just very challenging to adapt I think, since it requires a lot of setup. Overall, I think Arrowverse did CoIE better because they had many seasons of TV to build up to it.

Adding an extra 1/2 star only for the nostalgia/fan service of referencing older animated series.

#### The Fall Guy (2024)

Watched on 2024-09-27: ★★★★★



{{% photos the-fall-guy-2024 %}}

 I loved this one. It was cute, it was funny, it was clever, it was meta. I liked the performances, especially ATJ being an insane movie star and Emily Blunt being adorable and Gosling's Colt Seavert just taking everything on the chin. I liked the stunt work, the behind the scenes look of how a movie is made, Metalstorm and Jason Momoa lol

#### Argylle (2024)

Watched on 2024-09-27: ★★½



{{% photos argylle-2024 %}}

 This was not as bad as reviews had led me to believe and I was entertained, but it was still pretty messy. A bit too long and probably a bit too many plot twists. Sam Rockwell gives a good performance but I'm not sure I buy him and BDH as a couple. There's a couple of ridiculous action set pieces in the third act which seemed a bit much then I found out later that this was directed by Matthew Vaughn and I was like "Well that makes sense."

### TV

#### Batman: Caped Crusader

★★★★

This was short (only 10 eps) but very good. Feels a lot more low-tech/low-power and has a more 1920s feel than Batman TAS. I love the villain redesigns. Catwoman's costume harkens back to her first appearance in the Golden Age, Clayface is just some guy who can change his appearance, Penguin is a gender-swapped gangster with a cabaret theme. We do still get a dose of mystic stuff despite the low power level though. Harley Quinn is the most reimagined villain here, with a new origin.independent of the Joker. This show's Batman is young and arrogant and treats his butler poorly at least at first (this might be the first adaptation I've seen where Bruce did not grow up seeing Alfred as a father figure) and has lots of room to grow. Looking forward to more.

#### Only Murders in the Building S2-3

★★★★

I was a bit meh on [the first season of this show](/2022/12/movies-tv-2022/#only-murders-in-the-building), but it kept getting high praise so I gave it another shot and I found myself appreciating seasons 2 and 3 much more. I think it's because I'm more aware of what kind of show to expect here - it's not a "haha" funny comedy show, it's kind of an absurdist and clever black comedy, if that makes sense. Oh, and there are so much more cameos in seasons 2 and 3 than the first one. Season 2 dives deeper into the world of podcasting by introducing a rival podcaster, while season 3 is a deep dive into the theater business. I actually also already started season 4 and was hoping to include it in this review, but I found out just yesterday that the season was actually still ongoing so that would have to wait!
