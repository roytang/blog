#### Anime

I believe I first saw the Slam Dunk anime on the local cable channel AXN in the late 90s. I believe this version was in Japanese with subtitles, because I don't have a memory of Sakuragi's voice in English. 

I'm not big on basketball, though my brothers are, but we all loved it. We somehow managed to watch the entire series as it aired on cable. I was still in college then, so following a late afternoon anime show wasn't that big of an issue, but it's still a bit amazing to look back at how we used to watch stuff, having to wait for it to come on air at a specific time, like savages.

Anyway, Slam Dunk. Excellent characters and story and sports anime action, instant classic. Filipinos are already basketball-crazy by default, so unsurprisingly it was a hit locally and a few years later a Filipino dub would air on local TV, but I never saw too many episodes of that one. Many younger people I know still reference the local version when we talk about it, by referring to some of the characters by their Filipino nicknames, i.e. "Labo" instead of "Megane-kun" for Kogure. Speaking of Kogure, the show's pacing was usually very good except for some notorious spots like Kogure's single three-point shot against Kainan taking an entire episode because of flashbacks. There was very little filler, though the anime ended way before the actual manga's storyline did, and instead added an extra game against an "all-star" team of previous opponents as a sort of epilogue.

#### Manga

Despite loving the anime, I never bothered looking up the manga after watching it. Then around February 2005, I chanced upon a local book shop in EDSA Shang (honestly it might have been a book sale) selling cheap prints of the manga; at the time up to volume 14 was available, and I immediately purchased the first 10 books and tore through them quickly. I bought the next 4 books within the week. 

This was a Singaporean release of the manga published by Chuang Yi and distributed to the PH and some other Asian countries and the cover price for each volume was a very cheap P95. I believe at the time individual floppy issues of American comics were selling for around P150-P200 so this was comparatively a very good deal.

I think the succeeding volumes came out and were availably on a monthly basis, and there were 31 volumes in total, which means I probably completed this run around 17 months later. (Volume 31 says the first printing was in December 2005, so I guess there was some delay before the PH version was released.) I remember regularly passing by comic shops in both EDSA Shang and Megamall hoping to find the next volume. Back then I was mostly reading manga either through borrowing from friends or digitally through fan translations. To this day, Slam Dunk remains the one and only manga series I have ever bought the complete print run for. And because these were print copies, my brothers were able to enjoy the series as well; our volumes were *very* well-read, and it was not uncommon for a volume or two or three to be found on the shelves in the bathroom.

Whereas the anime story ends after the Shohoku team qualified for the Nationals tournament in Hiroshima, the manga continues that story well into the Nationals tournament. While the manga's story felt like it ended all too quickly, the final game against defending champions Sannoh was incredibly good and intense and I was sad that I never got a chance to see it animated.

Until now.

The [first trailer for this movie came out in late 2022](https://twitter.com/movie_slamdunk/status/1588503396067446786/), with a December 2022 release date. I believe it aired in local cinemas around late 2023, but I never got a chance to watch it then. This year it finally sees a Blu-ray release and it is also dropping on PH Disney+ so I was finally able to see it.

This movie covers the Nationals game against Sannoh and I am absolutely thrilled to finally see it animated. It also includes new flashback scenes fleshing out Miyagi's backstory. The 3d animation style for the basketball action scenes looked pretty good and fluid, and watching that final part of the game fully animated and with matching music and sounds was great, even if I knew full well what was going to happen.

The film doesn't include the disappointing epilogue from the manga that discusses what happens to the team after the Sannoh game, instead adding a new epilogue scene with Miyagi and Sawakita.
