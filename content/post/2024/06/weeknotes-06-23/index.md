### The World

Lots of nonsense happening in local politics, as usual. "Let them fight," I whisper.

### My Week

This week was exhausting, most of it prep for next week's immunotherapy and follow-ups for the surgery last week. It felt like most of my errands were concentrated in the middle of the week, so for the last few days I mostly just vegged out and played Hades. 

On Wednesday I spent most of the morning and afternoon on errands and when that was done I spent some time [wandering around Fisher Mall](/2024/06/lego-star-wars/) before heading to [a quiz night](/collections/quiznights/smartypants-tinybar). My feet were aching by the end of the day.

On the blog: [Wrote about How I Process Links](/2024/06/processing-links/) and [User Agents, Bots, and Scrapers](/2024/06/bots-scrapers/).

I spent a bunch of time catching up on my feed reader backlogs lately (hence the link processing post above), and I'm really envious about some bloggers that seem to make even their most mundane of days interesting, even when just chronicling daily walks. Thinking of how I can be more observational so I can write similarly as well maybe? IDK, we'll see. 

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of **Hades**, to the neglect of the two RPGs I started last week!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. I have done a couple of **Modern Horizons 3** draft on Arena, it is very challenging. I initially was planning to ignore the set, but then I agreed to join a paper draft in a couple of weeks and I was like "I can't just jump into that unprepared!"
  
- **Reading**: Still just more comics, mostly Marvels. Might have enough for a new [complete-marvel-run](/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post within the next two weeks.

- **Watching**: This week I watched [The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-life-aquatic-with-steve-zissou/). Watching random TV shows.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 66,244 steps. Each day is a challenge, I find myself having to catch up later and later in the day. I almost hit my weekly quota, but a combination of a rainy Saturday evening, scheduled events, and admittedly a bit of laziness caused me to miss Saturday's target. 

### Website Changes

More cleaning up old notes, adding new secret pages, work on a part of the website I've been wanting to do for a while.

### Some Links of Interest

- [I Will Fucking Piledrive You If You Mention AI Again — Ludicity](https://ludic.mataroa.blog/blog/i-will-fucking-piledrive-you-if-you-mention-ai-again/#fnref:8)

    > "Despite this we don't sell AI services of any sort. The market is so distorted that it's almost as bad as dabbling in the crypto space. It isn't as bad, meaning that I haven't yet reached the point where I assume that anyone who has ever typed in import tensorflow is a scumbag, but we're well on our way there."

- [Indie Wiki Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/)

    Okay, this is pretty neat: a browser extension that automatically redirects the usual large ad-enshittified wiki sites to indie wikis, or to a breezewiki equivalent if needed. I visit the Marvel Fandom wiki a lot, so this seems useful!

- [A Few Lessons from Roger Federer’s Dartmouth Commencement Speech](https://kottke.org/24/06/a-few-lessons-from-roger-federers-dartmouth-commencement-speech)

    My favorite part: "When you’re playing a point, it is the most important thing in the world.

    But when it’s behind you, it’s behind you… This mindset is really crucial, because it frees you to fully commit to the next point… and the next one after that… with intensity, clarity and focus."

- [Pentagon ran secret anti-vax campaign to undermine China during pandemic](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-covid-propaganda/)

    The PH was the main victim. I imagine ultimately the US military will not face any consequences though

### This Coming Week

Yet another immunotherapy session tomorrow.

We plan to attend a quiz night on Thursday.

Got some news today that kind of upends our regular household schedule; it might make me more busy over the next couple of weeks.
