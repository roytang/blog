### Previously

This is the part 9 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). This one is all about the **Jessica Jones**.

I was originally planning to have a single post tackling Jessica, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist together, since those characters are all in Netflix shows and are mostly in each other's orbit and individually don't have a lot of issues. But the resulting post would have ended up way too long again, mostly due to multiple shorter series and one-shots. So we'll try something new and do shorter entries! 

### Jessica Jones

First appearance: Alias #1 (Sep 2001) by Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos

#### Alias (2001)

28 issues.

This was the first book of Marvel's more mature-targetted "MAX line". I think I have read this before (at least the early arcs), but it was well worth the re-read. The story is very good, and Bendis is at his best with solo street-level stuff. The art by Gaydos is okay, but feels a bit minimalistic and maybe a bit too dark-toned. Jessica is introduced and is revealed to have been part of the MU from the older days, attending high school with Peter Parker. I first read about that last fact during Bendis' New Avengers run and thought it was introduced there, but it's actually a big part of her origin story from Alias!

In this volume: Jessica works as a PI and finds out Captain America's secret identity; Jewel identity/origin story; Jessica dates Scott Lang; Jessica's history with Kilgrave and eventually getting back and punching him; she ends the series being pregnant with Luke's daughter

#### The Pulse (2004)

14 issues.

Jessica takes up a job at the Daily Bugle, working with Ben Urich to provide superhuman people-interest stories. This is actually less of a Jessica-focused title and more of an ensemble cast thing with some reporters. Has some fun moments. Norman Osborne's secret identity is exposed. Doctor Strange is the surgeon who delivers Luke and Jessica's daughter by the end of the series.

#### Jessica Jones (2016)

18 issues. Marvel Fandom lists this as Jessica Jones v2 (see below).

Bendis and Gaydos reunite for more JJ as part of the Marvel NOW relaunch! I have read this one before, but again it was a good re-read. Jessica pretends to have fallen from grace to help Carol in an undercover operation, it pisses off Luke. The series ends with Purple Man killing himself and Carol supposedly throwing him into the sun. 

#### One-shots and Limited Series

- What If: Jessica Jones Joined The Avengers? (2005) - one-shot by Bendis and Gaydos. Narrated by an obvious Bendis self-insert, this one plays out more like Bendis' fantasy of what would have happened with Jessica as an Avenger. She ends up preventing the events of Avengers Disassembled (I haven't read this yet!) and marrying Steve Rogers! (Bendis would later add Jessica to the Avengers himself as part of his New Avengers. She didn't end up with Cap though, that would be silly.)

- Jessica Jones v1 (2015) - one-shot. This is listed as "Netflix Jessica Jones NYCC special" on Marvel Unlimited, and it turns out it's not part of the 616 and is actually a tie-in/preview for the NF series. Wikipedia does not include this entry, but Marvel Fandom lists it as JJ v1.

- Jessica Jones: Blind Spot (2020) - 6 issues: Jessica investigates a murder and finds a reality altering guy. At the end of it, her daughter turns purple, leading into the next one. This was originally a digital release, and is listed twice on Marvel Unlimited (the second one is marked as digital original).

- Jessica Jones: Purple Daughter (2021) - 3 issues on Marvel Unlimited. Originally a digital release, later released as a TPB in paper. Jessica finds out Dani turning purple was an SOS from Kilgrave who was being held captive by his son. Emma Frost guest stars!

#### Other Appearances

Previously reviewed: [Variants (2022)](/2023/05/marvel-run-4-thor-etc/#variants-2022) 

I first heard of Jessica while reading Bendis' New Avengers. She also appears in some other events/limited series with Luke Cage and Danny Rand, which I'll cover in a later post.

### MCU Comparisons

Season 1 of the Netflix show was all about Kilgrave who is indeed Jessica's traditional nemesis (although he's also a Daredevil villain). But season 2 and 3 featured more minor villains as Jessica doesn't really have a deep rogue's gallery of her own. I really liked Kristen Ritter's portrayal though, and she is in mind whenever I read about Jessica in the comics.

### Progress Bar

Total issues covered in this post: 71. Not a lot!

Total number of titles/volumes covered in this post: 7

Total issues covered so far: 3,841 + 71 = 3,912.

Current total (released) according to [the reference reading order](https://cmro.travis-starnes.com/reading-order.php?page=1&list_type=1&limit=30): 
34,793 (+123 from 3 months ago, not a lot considering.)

Progress: 11.24% (11.9% last post)

We have a slight dip in progress here since I didn't cover a lot of issues today. But I have a bunch of Luke Cage/Iron Fist stuff already read and queued up and I expect to write posts for those in the next couple of weeks, so we should recover quickly probably.

### Up Next

As mentioned, we'll cover fellow Netflix series characters Luke Cage and Iron Fist, still following "MCU Order".
