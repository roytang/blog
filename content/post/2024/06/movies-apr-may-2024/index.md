I haven't watched a lot of movies lately, but I did manage to start Monsterverse and Anderson runs. I still have so many movies on my to-watch lists!

#### The Out-Laws (2023)

Watched on 2024-04-26: ★★★

 Watched this one with my mom because I thought she might enjoy it but her reaction was a bit meh. I probably ended up enjoying it more than her. It's basically sitcom-level hijinks with a heist/crime component involved. Some good gags here and there that made me lol.

#### Godzilla (2014)

Watched on 2024-05-11: ★★★★



{{% photos godzilla-2014 %}}

 I believe this is the first Godzilla film I've ever watched. I liked it! Some fun cinematography choices, often rendering the kaiju in greyscale punctuated by colorful human elements. All the events of the story were precipitated by irresponsible mining activities in the Philippines lol. Cranston had a great performance but not much screen time. Always happy to see Elizabeth Olsen, although her role wasn't very important. She and ATJ play husband and wife here, a year before they portrayed brother and sister in Age of Ultron, IDK if that was weird. The humans made a plan to resolve the crisis but it was utterly ineffective and in the end they were little more than bystanders. Looking forward to the next film.

#### Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024)

Watched on 2024-05-12: ★★★



{{% photos kung-fu-panda-4-2024 %}}

 Watched this with my bro and his kids. The kids were rapt, and my brother commented that this franchise has been milked so much. Despite that, I did like that they tried to give Po a new direction other than just being the Dragon Warrior forever, although I'm not convinced yet about the choice of successor. The big bad here was a bit disappointing; after all that build up, it didn't take much for Po and his protege to take her down.

#### Rushmore (1998)

Watched on 2024-05-23: ★★★★½

 An odd and quirky coming of age story. I started watching and wasn't sure what to expect, and just felt compelled to keep watching. Anderson's visual style is readily apparent even this early in his career

#### The Royal Tenenbaums (2001)

Watched on 2024-05-26: ★★★★



{{% photos the-royal-tenenbaums-2001 %}}

 For some reason I always assumed this was about some kind of royal family. Instead it's about a dysfunctional family and the father (Gene Hackman) trying to reconnect with them in his old age. Quirky and with Anderson's recognizable style. I think I enjoyed this a bit less than Rushmore, as I am not particularly into family drama.

#### Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019)

Watched on 2024-05-29: ★★★★

 Found myself a bit less invested in the family drama this time around. At least the humans have a lot more agency in this film than in the 2014 one; it's interesting that they developed a way to interact with the Titans and were ultimately even able to help Godzilla beat the big bad.
