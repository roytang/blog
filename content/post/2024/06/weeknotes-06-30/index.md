A fifth weeknotes for the month! A rare treat.

### The World

Trump and Biden had their first debate, and by all accounts Biden performed terribly. Macron's snap election gambit to push back against the far right in France seems on shaky ground.

In local news: [NBI confirms](https://www.rappler.com/philippines/nbi-confirms-fingerprints-mayor-alice-guo-hua-ping-match/) that controversial mayor Alice Guo has fingerprints that match a Chinese national that came to the country in 2003! We somehow managed to elect a Chinese spy to a local chief executive position!

The world continues to challenge my optimism.

### My Week

Another exhausting week for multiple reasons. 

One of the reasons is that last Sunday, our helper suddenly had to go home to the province to attend to family matters for a couple of weeks. I helped her book a flight and she was off early the next day. This complicates our week because now the rest of us have more household chores to do and also ended up having to eat way more takeout, as the rest of us could not cook anything much more complicated than frying hotdogs in the morning. Also, my dad has a household rule that we NEVER leave the house unattended. This was easy when the helper was often at home to keep watch, but now the rest of us can't all go out at once. 

The week also involved a bunch of medical errands. Monday was of course immunotherapy day. My dad couldn't drive us to the hospital because of the above rule, so we had to take a Grab. This was the halfway point of the treatment protocol, and apparently that meant additional expensive tests afterwards to make sure everything is hunky-dory. I've been asked to handle more paperwork/bureaucracy to help with financial assistance, and it's the sort of errands I dread. Lots of waiting in queues! Sigh. 

Last Sunday: While out walking, I passed by a skinny guy carrying a bunch of stuff and he was walking slowly and kept looking behind him at a tiny black kitten. As he passed by he glanced at me sheepishly, then turned back to the kitten and said in a low voice "Stop following me!"

Monday: At the hospital all day for immunotherapy. While I was there, I got a call from my bank telling me I had missed a credit card payment last month. Oops.

Tuesday: My dad asked me to help with some printing, and that was how I found out we were out of printer ink.

Wednesday: Trudged over to the baranggay hall to get some papers.

Thursday: Groceries, buying new printer ink, and in the evening I managed to sneak off and do [a quiz night](/2023/06/popquiz-rainbow/).

Friday: Back to the hospital, visiting 4 different departments to get papers.

Saturday: Kinda lazy. I missed my step target because family came to visit and that used up my walking time.

On the blog: Wrote [a new complete-marvel-run entry for Jessica Jones](/2024/06/cmr-jessica-jones/).

At least I am somehow able to keep up with my reading backlogs (more or less) and got some work done on some side projects, including more secret website updates.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of **Hades**, trying to do all the quests, still ignoring the 2 RPGs I should also be playing.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. More **Modern Horizons 3** drafting, but understanding the set and doing well remains elusive. Regular weelend [Gloomhaven](/2022/12/gloomhaven/) coop session with friends has been going strong the past few months; I believe we have completed the Jaws of the Lion campaign and may be close to completing the main campaign as well.
  
- **Reading**: Still just more comics, mostly Marvels. Am about halfway through my current Murakami book read.

- **Watching**: This week I watched [Jason Bourne (2016)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/jason-bourne/). Finished watching **Abbott Elementary S3**. Started watching **Criminal Minds S17**, the season is kind of annoying about trying to be too clever. Started watching **The Boys S4** and want to start **The Acolyte** soon as well, mostly because we missed a couple of questions during the quiz night!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 67,584 steps. I thought I could make it, but I ended up missing Saturday (see above). Still, pretty good showing all things considered. I've been having to do the morning *pandesal* runs, so that helps.

### Some Links of Interest

- [A Eulogy for DevOps](https://matduggan.com/a-eulogy-for-devops/)

    Reading this gave me a bit of a headache. How did we let software development get so complicated?

- [I Have a Terrible Memory. Am I Better Off That Way?](https://www.thecut.com/article/memory-people-who-remember-vs-forget.html)

    IDK about the duality between rememberers and forgetters described here, feels like the few people I asked weren't firmly in one camp or another, remembering some things and forgetting some, nothing as extreme as discussed in the article.

    What did interest me was the notion that rememberers tend to be less happy than forgetters, mostly because I strive to try to be more of a rememberer via channels like this website or journalling or obsessive logging lol
