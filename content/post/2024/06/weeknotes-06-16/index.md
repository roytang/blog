This week's entry coming in very late in the day as a result of laziness (a recurring theme!)

### My Week

This week was not as busy as I'd expected. We had a holiday in the middle of the week, and after that I had to accompany a parent for a cataract surgery,hopefully something we never have to do again! Despite the relatively free schedule, I found myself saying "Why is it like these small errands keep popping up every day?" by the end of the week.

Today was Father's day, and we were hoping the pamangkins would visit, but it would seem everyone was busy doing their own thing. One of the fams dropped in for a quick visit in the morning though, which was nice. Instead I took the parents out for a nice lunch somewhere nearby.

Got to work on some stuff I've been putting off for a while.

On the blog: [Complaining about Google Timeline and Microsoft Recall](/2024/06/google-timeline-microsoft-recall/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of **Hades** and also a bit of **Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes**. Also got started with **Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door**, but I have not yet gone very far in either of those RPGs. These may take a while!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. 
  
- **Reading**: Still just more comics, mostly Marvels. I am going at a good pace, but I fear the next Complete Marvel Run post might have way too much stuff again! Also, a while back I started reading **The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle**, my first Murakami book. My pace for this one is pretty slow, as I only bring it out to read a short chapter or two whenever I'm in a queue or such.

- **Watching**: This week I watched [Burn After Reading (2008)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/burn-after-reading/) and [Godzilla Minus One (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/godzilla-minus-one/). Also caught up with **Abbott Elementary season 3**, but apparently there's a couple more episodes not yet on Disney+.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 64,000 steps. I have missed the target again, mostly due to laziness on Wednesday, which I justify by reminding myself it was a holiday. Let's see if we can't make it up this coming week.

### Website Changes

More cleaning up old notes, adding new secret pages, work on a part of the website I've been wanting to do for a while.

### Some Links of Interest

I did a good job this week of catching up on my feed reader backlogs, so I have a bunch of links to share this time:

- [Notes on Apple TV Plus, streamer business models, and the Foundation series – Baldur Bjarnason](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2024/foundation-apple-tv-plus/)

    I'm not especially interested in the review of Foundation, though it does sound good. (I did not find the books exceptionally good.) Sharing mostly for the insightful discussion of how the current streaming has detached production revenue from media quality and the effects this has had on what kinds of shows/movies we get

- [Your brain does not process information and it is not a computer | Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/your-brain-does-not-process-information-and-it-is-not-a-computer)

    I found this fascinating as I'm not too informed on the neuroscience side of it, but it also doesn't bode well for those hoping the singularity will save humanity somehow

- [AI Is a False God | The Walrus](https://thewalrus.ca/ai-hype/)

- [Retailers Hate That You Buy Big Things on Your Laptop](https://kanebridgenews.com/retailers-hate-that-you-buy-big-things-on-your-laptop/)

    Well, it's a desktop for me, but yes I do avoid making online purchases on my phone. I actually hadn't even thought about it until reading this, I just instinctively thought it made sense!

- [I’ll never stop blogging: it’s an itch I have to scratch – and I don’t care if it’s an outdated format | Simon Reynolds | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/26/blogging-freedom-outdated-format)

    > "But if it’s not compelled, blogging is compulsive: an itch I have to scratch. And for every post published, there are five that never get beyond notepad scrawls or fumes in the back of my mind."

- [Generative AI is for the idea guys](https://rachsmith.com/ai-is-for-the-idea-guys/)

    > "Generative AI is like the ultimate idea guy’s idea! Imagine… if all they needed to create a business, software or art was their great idea, and a computer. No need to engage (or pay) any of those annoying makers who keep talking about limitations, scope, standards, artistic integrity etc. etc."

- [Modern WordPress - Yikes! – David Bushell – Freelance Web Design (UK)](https://dbushell.com/2024/05/07/modern-wordpress-themes-yikes/)

    I haven't looked in on Wordpress in a while; this seems terrible

### This Coming Week

Tomorrow (Monday the 17th) is a holiday over here. Some kind of Eid.

We plan to attend a quiz night on Wednesday.

More medical errands as usual, prep for the next immunotherapy session.
