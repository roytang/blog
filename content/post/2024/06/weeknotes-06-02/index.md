Another month, another chance for us to prove we deserve to exist under capitalism.

### The World

Donald Trump has been found guilty of 34 felonies for falsifying business records with the intent to influence elections. Or something like that. Predictably, many prominent Republicans have gone over the rails to support him in spite of this.

PAGASA has declared the onset of rainy season last week. Although after last weekend's typhoon dissipated we were back to scorching hot days.

### My Week

This week has been a bit light. Still a few errands to run, mostly as prep for the next week's procedure, but nothing too exhausting.

The first few days were rainy, but by Wednesday the sun was back in full force to punish us for thinking we could escape his wrath.

At least I had time to work on some hobby projects, more MTG inventory, stuff like that. Could have gone out to a quiz night but the rest of the team wasn't up for it, and I didn't have the energy.

On Saturday evening the Luzon power grid was on red alert and Meralco warned of rotating brownouts. Power went out in our area around 6pm, right as anticipated mass was about to start. The service had to start late as it took them 30 minutes to make alternative arrangements re:microphones and speakers and such. It was dark; everybody had fans, it was so hot. I attended with my brother and his family and our parents. The kids were running around at the sides despite the heat, and when the power thankfully came back around 7:30pm, their mom immediately had their shirts changed because they were all drenched with sweat. Took a few minutes for the large ceiling fans to power up, but they were a welcome relief.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Been playing a lot of **Hades** again, this time managing to be a lot better at low heat. I still really should start a new RPG or something at some point though. Also played an indie game on itch.io called [Sort the Court](/2024/05/sort-the-court/)
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. 
  
- **Reading**: Still just more comics, mostly just Marvels.

- **Watching**: [Movie reviews for April and May are up](/2024/06/movies-apr-may-2024/). Also wrote reviews for [X-Men 97 season 1](/2024/05/xmen97/) which finished a couple of weeks ago, and [Star Trek Discovery](/2024/05/star-trek-discovery/) which just aired its series finale.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 60,158 steps. I was unable to walk during last Sunday because the rains were really bad during that day, so I'm kind of just happy to get to 60k. It does feel a bit disappointing whenever I don't hit 70k for the week, but looking over the year to date, it looks like I have only missed around 7 days worth of steps total, which is a pretty good rate!

### Website Changes

Not much this week.

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot to share today:

- [How to Live Forever by David Owen](https://archive.md/SkvCJ)

    (New Yorker archive link) A longish article about chronicling your life. I can related to so much of this and honestly wish I had more solid records of pre-blogging years

- [How social networks prey on our longing to be known](https://janmaarten.com/polywork/)

    > "To be online today is to constantly walk a tight-rope between the longing to be known and the dread of being perceived."

### This Coming Week

Another immunotherapy session tomorrow. We are almost to the halfway point! 

Oh wow, Godzilla Minus One dropped on Netflix! Adding yet another one to my "to watch" list.
