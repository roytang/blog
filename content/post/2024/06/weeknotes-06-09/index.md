This week's entry coming in a day late because Sunday was busy with family stuff.

### My Week

Monday was immunotherapy day; it went fairly well, not a lot of people this time and we got home relatively early. I also got a test done for myself while I was there, a "just in case" check recommended by my doctor and I got the results a couple of days later and everything was normal.

I thought the rest of the week was going to be light but then I found myself saying "Why is it like there are new errands every day?" (loosely translated) on Saturday morning as I was about to head out again for yet another errand. This week's errands included trying to resolve bank troubles, an extra grocery run because we ran out of some stuff mid-week, and picking up long-delayed documents from a government office.

This was a hot week still.

Got together with family yesterday to celebrate one of the *pamangkins*'s life events. Discussions among the me and my brothers centered around how careers were going, good banks to use, the kids' achievements, and comparing electric bills. Such adults!

Trivia team went back to Don Conejos for [another quiz night last Thursday and crushed it](/2024/06/don-conejos-03/)!

On the blog: [Wrote about Slam Dunk](/2024/06/slam-dunk/)! Wish I had the time and energy to write more.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of **Hades** again, though there are soooo many other games I want to play. To that end, when I passed by the mall I decided to get a copy of **Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door** for Switch (haven't tested it yet). After I bought that, suddenly **Octopath Traveler** 1 and 2 dropped on Game Pass, then **Marvel's Midnight Suns** became free on epic and I'm like @_@. Given all of these options, I decided to start playing [Eiyuden Chronicle: Hundred Heroes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h9gfq8_H1A) instead!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. 
  
- **Reading**: Still just more comics, mostly just Marvels. 

- **Watching**: Watched **The First Slam Dunk (2022)** (review included in the blog post linked above). Started watching **Abbott Elementary season 3**

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,233 steps. Good to be back hitting the target again!

### Website Changes

Not much this week. Well, maybe some secret new pages added somewhere.

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot to share today:

- [Pluralistic: Linkrot (21 May 2024) – Pluralistic: Daily links from Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2024/05/21/noway-back-machine/)

    > "Libraries burn. The Internet Archive may seem like a sturdy and eternal repository for our collective object permanence about the internet, but it is very fragile, and could disappear like that."

- [Ursula K. Le Guin on How to Become a Writer ‹ Literary  Hub](https://lithub.com/ursula-k-le-guin-on-how-to-become-a-writer/)

    > "See, the thing is, as a writer you are free. You are about the freest person that ever was. Your freedom is what you have bought with your solitude, your loneliness. You are in the country where you make up the rules, the laws."

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

My feed reader backlog is insanely large right now. Kinda tempted to just mark everything as unread! (My OCD would never...)

### This Coming Week

Wednesday is a holiday, allegedly our independence day.

Second cataract surgery scheduled for later this week. 

So many things I want to do, so little time. I don't understand how I managed back when I was working full-time. (Hint: I didn't.)
