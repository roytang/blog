Google recently announced its search engine would begin deprioritizing web search results in favor of AI-generated summaries. I am not sure if it is enabled in our country yet, but we already have the "Web" tab of search results relegated to like 7th place, hidden behind a "More" tab.

The responses to this so far aren't very positive, as evidenced by all the articles immediately written up about how to disable the AI overviews:

Seriously, there's at least [3 whole pages of those results](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=google+disable+ai+overview). None of the links there seem to have the correct answer: use other search engines like [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/).

I like this article about it by Platformer: [Google’s broken link to the web](https://www.platformer.news/google-io-ai-search-sundar-pichai/), and especially this quote:

> This new approach is captured elegantly in a slogan that appeared several times during Tuesday’s keynote: let Google do the Googling for you. It’s a phrase that identifies browsing the web — a task once considered entertaining enough that it was given the nickname “surfing” — as a chore, something better left to a bot.

The thing is, the decision seems completely justifiable from a business perspective (because keeping people in Google's walled garden lets them hog the advertising income) and from a customer perspective. That last one is because honestly, I don't think most people who are online care about the web or understand what it is really. 

Most people don't really wake up in the morning and say "hey, I think I'll surf the web today!" or "I think I'll check out some websites!" If they find some idle time they will browse social media platforms and those few brave souls who venture off into search engines are usually only there looking for specific answers, so delivering those specific answers to them directly saves them the effort of looking through all the search results to get what they want. 

It didn't used to be like this of course. I [shared a link](/2024/05/13e1d3a6bcfa60992e469a945b334db6/) before from Molly White: [We can have a different web](https://www.citationneeded.news/we-can-have-a-different-web/). Excerpt:

> It feels grim, and especially so for those of us who remember the days before the walls. We miss the messy but innovative landscaping, the use of space beyond the tiny squares our landlords provide us, the mostly polite strangers who wandered through and remarked on our work or shared their knowledge with us.
> 
> But we often forget: that world is still out there.

And it's true, for many of us who were online during that era, we miss that old web feeling, when everyone had their own website and most of the web wasn't just five different websites with screenshots from the others. But I don't think we are the majority here. The online world changed with the smartphone era and the mass adoption that came with it. Most people aren't on desktops or laptops anymore, but on phones, tiny devices not really well-suited to the task of browsing the infinite tapestry of the web. Instead most users confine themselves to walled gardens and their apps, rarely venturing outside. This was a kind of [Eternal September](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September) for the online world 

The situation has not been helped by the rapid decline in quality of web search [^1] in the past 10 years or so. Largely incentivized by Google's own for-profit advertising models, the search engine was easily gamed by content farms and despite algorithm changes, the quality of Google search never recovered. Google was best for the web at its onset, but once it got its taste of that sweet, sweet ad sense money, there was no looking back. Hungry for ad views and engagement numbers, most websites are actively user hostile [^2], showing way too many ads and pop-ups in an attempt to wring some value from the user.

Those of us who miss the old web try to tell the companies that they should have their own websites and host their content there, instead of relying on platforms that may vanish one day or maybe just randomly deprioritize you in their feed algorithm. But why should companies do that when it costs time and money to create and maintain a website and the platforms are offering you a place to do all that for free? Sure you have less control, but all the users are on those apps anyway and most of them won't venture too far out of their walled gardens. We tell them making a website is easy and not that expensive and you can just share the links on the platforms, and sure that's true if you're a technical person but what about the nontechnical layman who just wants to sell homemade baking goods and not have to learn how to set up Wordpress and what the hell is a block editor? He already knows how to post on Instagram, he'll just do that.

We tell people to post on their blogs and personal websites that they control instead of social media platforms, but again not everyone has the time and money to do that. Those of who explored the early web were largely hobbyists and enthusiasts, technical people who enjoyed that sort of thing. The vast majority of people don't fall into that camp. Most people won't have the privilege of learning and doing all this stuff in their free time [^3].

Despite all these problems, I still believe the web is worthwhile, and I want to believe the web will survive the current AI trend. After all, there will always be people willing and able to make websites and share their stories. I don't think [web persons or word persons](/2022/11/word-web-persons/) will ever truly vanish, despite being in the minority. I have been writing on this blog for more than 20 years, I will probably keep writing for 20 more.

Search engines discouraging people from writing content (since they will be sending much less traffic to your website anymore) is certainly a problem that will tend to make even these AI-generated summaries worse over time (who is going to be writing about all the new information that crops up moving forward if people aren't incentivized to write on websites?), but I think that like all damage, the internet will eventually find a way to route around it. If anything, at least the advertising model that has plagued the web over the past decade or so is being disrupted and people may find new ways to monetize their writing inspite of the AI juggernaut. And who knows, maybe all the content farms and clickbait headlines will fade away and we find a way to grow a new, better web.

The old web is dying; the new web struggles to be born.
