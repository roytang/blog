Another week has come and gone. Time marches forward earnestly and relentlessly.

### The World

Biden and Trump have agreed on scheduled debates. I am mostly expecting Trump to try to weasel out of it.

Meanwhile, Xi and Putin have re-affirmed their being forever best buds. China's coast guard continues to harass us in our own waters.

So much AI-related nonsense. I might write about some of it this coming week.

### My Week

Monday's immunotherapy session went well, though the results from some of the paperwork I filed was disappointing.

On the blog: Wrote [a review for the Fallout TV show](/2024/05/fallout-tv-show/) and also [added a ShareOpenly feedback option](/2024/05/shareopenly/).

I have no idea where most of my week went, though I suspect it was gaming-related (see below). Well, I did manage to get some of my own projects moving again, although it's nothing I can talk about publicly.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: My week was kind of devoured by **Hades** (not the recently-released sequel). I [uploaded my first couple of runs on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXpsCEqaRUo) and towards the end of the week I managed my first escape on my 21st run! There is still so much to do afterwards!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. 
  
- **Reading**: Not a lot this week, not even very many comics. T_T

- **Watching**: Watched **Kung Fu Panda 4** with some of the *pamangkins* last Sunday. **X-Men '97** season finale aired this week; it was good, but not as good as some of the earlier episodes. The season deserves a review soon. Started watching the latest **Star Trek Discovery** season.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,575 steps. I believe this is my first time hitting the quota again since early-mid April. Feels good, but it is still often a struggle to overcome laziness and the urge to just be lazy. The slightly more agreeable weather helped, though the sporadic rain showers made some days challenging.

### Website Changes

Did some backend work to hopefully help reduce the resource usage on the server whenever I share a new post on Masto or whatever. (Will find out how effective it is after this post goes out.) Added the ShareOpenly feedback option.

    > "We are the human beings that are meant to curate the web. We should continue to spread the word about how we use the web, which is very personal and as active participants. We should make clear our desire for technologies that are accessible for non-technical people to be able to join us in controlling their own web presence. We build our websites and share our thoughts and link our links."

    > "But we often forget: that world is still out there.

    The walled enclosures that crowded out much of that acre of developed land still reside within an infinite expanse of possibility. There are no limits to the web â€” if it has borders, they are ever expanding. We may feel as though we are trapped in a tiny, crowded, noisy space, but it is only because we don't see over the walls."

    > "But the reality is that you can't build a hundred-billion-dollar industry around a technology that's kind of useful, mostly in mundane ways, and that boasts perhaps small increases in productivity if and only if the people who use it fully understand its limitations."

### This Coming Week

We have an additional procedure to be done later this week in between the immunotherapy sessions. Not as expensive, but still a nontrivial expense, and probably it was not a good idea to have this done amidst all the immunotherapy stuff, but I've been bugging my mom to get this done forever, so might as well.
