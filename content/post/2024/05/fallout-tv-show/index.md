So, the Fallout TV show on Prime Video. First season has 8 episodes. This isn't really an adaptation but more of an original story set in the Fallout universe, signficantly expanding the lore.

First: the look and the aesthetic and the sets and the costume are all great and remind me so much of what it felt like playing the 3D games. I was tempted to play one of the Fallout games after watching the very first episode!

The three protags are great POV characters and I feel like each one represents a certain style of playing the games:

- Lucy: good-guy protag; idealistic, earnest, always trying to do the right thing, casually horny
- The Ghoul: violence-focused protag, always looking for things to shoot
- Maximus: My least favorite of the protags, mostly because I dislike lying to people. Probably represents a more "pragmatic"/"practical" protag, adapting to the situation as needed. Has weird ideas about sex. Maybe the least plot-relevant.

The only thing that seemed out of sync with the games was that they weren't overloaded with inventory and a ton of guns 15 minutes in.

While the games were limited to background/environmental storytelling (like computer logs and holotapes) to tell the story of how the setting came to be, the show has the advantage of being able to provide flashbacks, building up the story of the events leading up to the bombs dropping.

The show expands on that lore signficantly, giving us a greater insight into what led to the post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Fallout universe. (Hint: It's capitalism!) I am not sure about certain decisions they made that affect some locations from the games. Both these decisions and the additional pre-apocalypse lore might end up as additional story burdens that challenge the story in future games, but supposedly Bethesda approved the story, so I guess it will be fine.

Overall I liked it. There might have a bit too much durdling around in the middle parts, but that's kind of on-theme with how the games play out as well! Looking forward to season 2!
