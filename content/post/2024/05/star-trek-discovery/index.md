I think one of the main problems with Star Trek Discovery had was that it was always way too earnest and intense, Michael Burnham almost constantly emoting into the camera, the crew constantly jumping from crisis to crisis, something that is very tonally different from the prior ST tv series. In fact, it might be closer in tone to the Kelvin universe movies. I did enjoy most of the sci-fi treatments, especially the timey-wimey stuff (I always enjoy timey-wimey stuff!)

It was also the first ST tv series to feature a continuous serialized story across each season, much less episodic than the older series. The only other series so far with this format was Picard. Maybe this what made it feel a lot less like Star Trek than say, *Strange New Worlds*.

Star Trek Discovery had a bit of an uneven run; I think my favorite seasons were the first one and the fourth one. The first two seasons felt unnecessarily chained to pre-TOS lore, making it difficult to take big swings with their story arcs. (*Strange New Worlds* avoids this problem with their more self-contained episodes.) This resulted in the very awkward in-universe retcon where they erased Discovery and its revolutionary spore drive from the Federation's history. Once they got to the 32nd century, they got to do bigger story arcs affecting large swaths of the galaxy.

My one question about the 32nd-century technology in the series is their concept of personal transporters that are built into their suits. Basically they just tap the badge on their chest to activate the transporters. How do the transporters know where they want to go?!? It's not some kind of verbal instruction, they don't always say out loud where they're going. In fact, in season 5, there are some action sequences where they're using the personal transporters to jump around in combat with alient beasts like they were Nightcrawler in [X-Men 97](/2024/05/xmen97/)!

Season 5 is a bit of an anthology story hidden behind a treasure hunt for a powerful McGuffin that could greatly change the balance of power in the galaxy. Each step of the hunt takes the crew to different planets and areas of the galaxy's to figure out a test to find the next clue. The season's villains are two former couriers named Moll and Lak and the Breen. This gives them a chance to explore various aspects of the vast Star Trek lore, and a timey-wimey episode even lets them visit and interact with the pre-32nd century Discovery crew. (Temporal Prime Directive be damned!)

The double-length series finale maintains Discovery's trend of wrapping things up neatly in a nice bow (with the eventual fate of the McGuffin being completely unsurprising). We also get a bit of an epilogue looking back at the history of the series and even a bit of fan service for longer-term Trekkies at the end.

Favorite character: Action Saru! The best thing about this portrayal is how when he's walking casually, his tall, lanky arms are waving hynoptically.

No matter what, Star Trek Discovery deserves credit for launching a new era of Star Trek TV, more than a decade after *Enterprise*. Without Discovery's initial success we might not have gotten the terrific *Strange New Worlds* and *Lower Decks*! The series wrapped up nicely and introduced us to an entire new era of possible Star Trek stories.
