title: 'The Song Begins: Rare(?) PH Boardgame'

A few months ago, my uncle visited us from the province and he brought us this boardgame that he says has been in his house for the longest time. It is a presumably locally-made song-guessing game called "The Song Begins", supposedly made in collaboration with Jose Mari Chan. It's a box with a bunch of cards and some other paraphernalia:

Each card has the opening lyrics to six songs on it, arranged according to decade. Members from each team are expected to guess the songs based on the opening lyrics. A sampling:

*(Feel free to try to guess what songs they are. Answers to the above cards are at the end of this post)*

From top to bottom, the songs are always:

- (Purple note) From the 40s or earlier
- (Orange note) From the 50s
- (Green note) From the 60s
- (Blue note) From the 70s
- (Yellow note) From the 80s
- (Red note) OPM (local PH songs)

Since the latest songs are from the 80s, I can only assume this game was made in the early 90s. The box says over 3000 song lyrics were encoded, so there are 500 cards in all. The older ones are quite hard; we ran a number of these by some oldies (my parents and my uncle etc) and they had trouble guessing many of them. We did not bother trying to play the game as the rules describe.

The most interesting thing about this is that I can find no information online about this game AT ALL. As far as I know, this copy we have is the only proof that it exists, perhaps the only copy that has ever existed?!? Was it a limited print run that didn't have much success? Is this a prototype that never got mass-produced?!? This very post may be the only online information about this game! [I asked around about it on r/Philippines](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/1cmuseg/does_anyone_have_any_info_about_a_local_ph_90s/), maybe someone will know about it.
