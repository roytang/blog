[ShareOpenly](https://shareopenly.org/) is a simple tool for sharing links to the fediverse and fediverse-compatible sites like Threads and Bluesky. The tool is made by [Ben Werdmuller](https://werd.io/) ([Some ShareOpenly updates](https://werd.io/2024/some-shareopenly-updates) is his most recent post on the matter.)

I've been meaning to give this a try, so I've added it to the feedback section at the bottom of each post. Although I guess that's not really a form of feedback is it? I have no way of knowing if a post has been shared this way. Anyhoo, it's there, if you want to take advantage of it.

We should spread adoption of small tools like this that encourage interop among different services!
