### Previously

This is the part 8 [^1] in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED**. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). This one is all about the **Guardians of the Galaxy**.

*(Note: All volume nos. are based on [the Wikipedia listings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_publications_(F%E2%80%93G))*, except where they don't make sense)

Note: This entry is quite long, you can use the TOC to navigate.

Marvel actually has two versions of Guardians of the Galaxy, the classic team from the 1960s, and the more modern incarnation from the 2000s that should be more familiar to the MCU fans. We'll cover both!
