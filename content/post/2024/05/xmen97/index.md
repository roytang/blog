(Spoilers in the photos towards the end of the post)

As an enjoyer of both the older X-Men '92 animated series and the 90's era X-Men comics, I admit to a bit of worry about X-Men 97 before it aired; it would be so easy to ruin the legacy of the older series with a subpar follow-up. Luckily, that worry was misplaced. The team understood the assignment and knocked it out of the park. I very much enjoyed the first season; unsurprisingas I am pretty much the target audience.

The quality of animation is great; at first I was like "this is just like how it was back in 92", but that was just me remembering the old series through nostalgia-tainted glasses. Any side by side comparison will show you the vast difference in animation quality that 30 years of advancements have afforded.

The season was short, only 10 episodes long, but they somehow managed to adapt and pack in so many classic 90s comics storylines. Off the top of my head, there's Professor X leaving the school to Magneto [^1], the Trial of Magneto, the Jean Grey clone saga, Lifedeath, the Genoshan genocide, Operation: Zero Tolerance, Fatal Attractions, and so on. And they even managed to throw in a surprise death or two!

My only gripe is that there is half an episode of Jubilee and Sunspot bumbling through Mojoworld that felt a bit like a filler ep, like they had an extra 15 minutes they weren't sure what to do with. 

Looking forward to season 2, though given how long the animation here reportedly took to produce, this might take a while!

[^1]: Though in the comics, he takes over the New Mutants, not the X-Men. Sunspot is the only actual New Mutant we get on the regular roster.
