It is a new month! These weeknotes are coming in a day late because I was out the whole weekend and exhausted even when I got back.

### My Week

As mentioned, I spent the weekend out of town, getting together with family to celebrate some recent happenings. Lots of swimming, eating snacks, videoke, and silly jokes. Always fun and very chaotic when everyone gets together!

The week was kind of a bust in terms of productivity.

Tuesday was errands day: helping the parents get to a lunch gathering, buying meds, getting together some docs we need for the next week, etc. 

Wednesday was a holiday, but we mostly spent it at home, suffering from the heat. Since it was also the first day of the new month, I did my usual monthly reviews. Financially, April was very challenging. Our electricity bill was also through the roof (consumption was 60% higher than the prior month!), which happens every April but somehow I still end up surprised. Next month's bill will probably be a little bit higher even, but after that hopefully we start to get some respite from this unforgiving heat and the usage normalizes.

Also reviewed my backups situation and it looks like one of my external drives is already failing so I might need to buy a new one soon. (Insert rant about things not lasting forever.)

Friday: I was expecting some other docs I needed to come in before today so that in the morning I could go out and submit them already but they were delayed so the day was mostly lost. TBH I was kind of dreading having to go and be in queues all morning so I was kind of relieved to kick the can down the road as it were. We did need to do an extra grocery run later in the day to buy stuff for the weekend trip.

On the blog: nothing last week other than the weeknotes! I do have some drafts in progress since there are things to write about, I just didn't get around to them. Hopefully we get to write more this week.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finished my second **Stellaris** run for the year, gonna give the game a break for a while. Have not yet started anything new though.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Thunder Junction quick drafts were this week, though I waited for the rank resets before proceeding. Second trophy remains elusive.

  
- **Reading**: Finally finished my GotG reading this week, so I will try to get the blog post together this week. And maybe reevaluate the whole [complete marvel run plan ](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) lol. An unexpected series I binge-read this week was Rumiko Takahashi's *Maison Ikkoku*, which I last read in the late 90s probably and I think I never finished because I don't recall this ending. Now I kind of want to read like all of *Urusei Yatsura*, *Ranma*, and *Inuyasha* then do a Rumiko Takahashi reviews/appreciation post. Might take a while!

- **Watching**: Currently around 75% through the **Fallout** TV show, it is fine. Not much else watched this week. I only watched one movie for the whole of April!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 59,480 steps, missing my weekly target, mostly due to the weekend trip, but admittedly also due to laziness. This coming week's target is likely to be missed as well, as I already did not hit 10k steps yesterday!

### Website Changes

Nothing this week.

    As someone who has always been a bit reserved when interacting with strangers, even online, I probably need to work more on "commenting to say how much you enjoy the content" or "dropping a quick note of appreciation via email or DM". I know I appreciate it when someone emails or DMs me about the blog, but somehow it feels like it would be bothersome if I do it!

### This Coming Week

- This week is prep week for the upcoming immunotherapy session next Monday. Should be mostly done by tomorrow, and hopefully the paperwork I have to get done is processed by then as well
- We might attend a quiz night this coming Thursday
- Also my backlogs are very bad right now, I should do something about that
