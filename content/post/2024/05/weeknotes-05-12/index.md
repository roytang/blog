### The World

I see so many posts about the Aurora Borealis (?) from people in the North. Once again we citizens of the tropics are discriminated against!

StackOverflow announced a partnership with OpenAI. People are upset. [Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/developers-really-not-happy-openai-101401197.html). [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/stack-overflow-users-sabotage-their-posts-after-openai-deal/).

Apple announced a bunch of iPad stuff I guess? Then [they had to apologize for a related controversial iPad ad](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/05/09/tech/apple-apologizes-for-ipad-pro-ad/index.html). I have not seen the ad, I heard it is crushing.

Probably more things have happened, but I am so behind on my reading.

### My Week

I don't know what happened to this week, it seemed to go by so quickly. I swear, time just slips through your grasp like sand. It wasn't even especially busy! I got some errands done, mainly prep work for the upcoming immunotherapy session and submitting paperwork, getting tests done, etc.

The weather is starting to calm dawn a little. Some days are more cloudy/overcast, and we even get some decent rain showers, giving some relief from the scorching heat. It's still a coin flip whether we get a really hot day or not though. PAGASA says the worst of the extreme heat should be over, so I am looking forward to gradually transitioning to more reasonable weather.

I did try to start some new Activities that I can't really talk about yet until they are done. These new Activities are on top of all the other ongoing Activities that I started months, years or maybe decades ago and have still yet to bear fruit (and thus also can't talk about). We just throw all these Activities at the wall and see what sticks, eh?

Thursday night [the trivia team attended a quiz night](/collections/quiznights/don-conejos-2).

On the blog: Added [a new entry in the complete Marvel run](/2024/05/cmr-gotg/), and also about [a rare PH boardgame we found](/2024/05/song-begins/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Nothing this week! Hoping to have the time start a new single-player game or two this week.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. Thunder Junction quick drafts have come and gone, so I have temporarily shifted back to grinding Standard to build up currency.

  
- **Reading**: Nothing too much to talk about this week, though I am reading a lot of comics. Trying to reorganize my reading to streamline the progress of my complete Marvel run.

- **Watching**: Finished the season of **Fallout**! Might write a review this week. Also watched **Godzilla (2014)** last night.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 60,448 steps, missing my weekly target. Which is fine, or so I keep telling myself. Hopefully I manage to get back to 70k this week. Better weather might make that easier.

### Website Changes

Sigh. Nothing this week.

### Some Links of Interest

I unfortunately have no new links to share this week.

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This Coming Week

- We have yet another immunotherapy session tomorrow. Aside from that we have some other checkups to get done as prep for yet another procedure.
- X-Men 97 season finale this week!
- Soooo many things I want to do/watch/read/play/etc. I have very many lists. Need more time/energy!
