It's almost the end of May, and the rains are starting to peek around the corner, giving us some relief from the summer heat.

### The World

Trump's hush money trial is coming to a close; closing arguments and jury deliberations are expected this coming week. No matter what, someone's going to be disappointed.

The ICC has started the process for issuing arrest warrants for Israeli and Palestine leaders over the current Gaza conflicts. The ICJ has ordered Israel to halt it's Rafah operations.

Locally, there has been a bit of a brouhaha lately over a local chief executive (city mayor) in the provinces suspected of being a Chinese spy and/or involved in POGO shenanigans. I haven't been following it too closely.

### My Week

I've had a week. One of the parents had a cataract operation done, it was apparently easy and painless, and not as expensive as the immunotherapy, but we had to wait around a while at the clinic where it was done because there was a queue.

On the blog: Wrote some AI/LLM ranty posts: ["AI"/LLM Mediocrity](/2024/05/ai-mediocrity/), [Is Google Killing The Web?](/2024/05/google-vs-web/)

This week I finally got started on a long-standing thing I wanted to do, which is to properly inventory the MTG paper collection. I tried a bunch of different tracking software, but settled on [deckbox.org](https://deckbox.org/). This is absolutely going to be a slog - it is a huge collection (I am a pack rat after all), I would guess in the tens of thousands of cards overall, though it's probably not worth it to inventory all the bulk commons/uncommons. I've been meaning to do this for a while because this is a prerequisite for eventually liquidating the collection, if I so choose. It will definitely take a while though.

I was also happily able to progress some archival work that I don't want to talk about yet.

Attended [an unplanned quiz night last Wednesday]( /collections/quiznights/225-bistro-90s-quiz)!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Took a break from **Hades** because my controller hands were starting to cramp. 
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. 
    - Other: For some reason or another, I decided to buy a new PS3 controller! I still have games to play on that system lol.
  
- **Reading**: Not a lot this week, a bunch of comics, the usual stuff, trying to keep up.

- **Watching**: I have been planning to dig into Wes Anderson, and this week I started with watching **Rushmore (1998)** and The **Royal Tenenbaums (2001)**. Still catching up with **Star Trek Discovery**.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,305 steps. Wasn't sure if I can make it on Saturday, as it was raining through most of it, but my umbrella was enough. Not sure if I can make it this week, as we are apparently in the middle of our first post-summer typhoon and it has been raining all day.

### Website Changes

Not much this week.

    > “When you first start out playing Magic, when you're playing with kids in the schoolyard or around the kitchen table with cards that your older brother played with, that is the way it works. Your friend will have a card you don't have. But when you enter the store system, then that's no longer the way it works, you just get many, many more cards, to the point where the magical aspect of having unique cards which nobody else has goes away.”

### This Coming Week

Lots of things to do again this week. More prep for the next immunotherapy session, plus some follow-ups for last week's operation. 

Looking forward to June.
