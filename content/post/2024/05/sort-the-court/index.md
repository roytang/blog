title: Sort the Court

[Sort the Court](https://graebor.itch.io/sort-the-court) is small game submitted to [Ludum Dare 34](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/), which had the theme "two-button controls". It's basically a kingdom management sim where you are given a series of yes/no decisions everyday to manage your kingdom, and you have the goal of growing your kingdom's population while managing your treasury (gold) and the citizens' happiness. There are some very quirky decisions in there. This game was a bit longer I expected; I played it for like 4 hours (while doing other things) and there wasn't any save so I didn't want to quit even when it was already past midnight lol. Managed to finish the "main story" at day 56, though you are allowed to keep playing indefinitely.
