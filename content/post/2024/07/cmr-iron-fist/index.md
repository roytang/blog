### Previously

This is the part 11 in my continuing insane effort to try to read **EVERY MARVEL COMIC EVER PUBLISHED** and write about them. You can see previous posts using the [tag "complete-marvel-run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run). This one is all about **Iron Fist**.

### Iron Fist

First appearance: Marvel Premiere #15 (May 1974) by Roy Thomas and Gil Kane.

#### Marvel Premiere (1972)

Covered here: 30 issues.

Marvel Premiere was a 61-issue anthology series featuring different Marvel characters that ran from 1972-1981. I have so far avoided covering anthology series, but since Iron Fist's origins and much of his mythology starts here, I decided to cover this one already. However, not all 61 issues are available on Marvel Unlimited; notably many of the later half issues are missing because many of them are no longer licensed by Marvel. I didn't want to bother trying to track them down (yet), so instead I will cover only the first 30 issues of this series (for now).

#1-#2: Featuring Adam Warlock. The High Evolutionary awakens the entity known only as "Him" and gives him the name "Warlock". The High Evolutionary creates Counter-Earth. Warlock later adapts the first name "Adam" as given to him by one of the humans on Counter-Earth.

#3-#14: Featuring Doctor Strange. The first arc introduces Shuma-Gorath and his minions and has a very strong Lovecraftian Eldritch Horror feel to it. The second arc introduces Sise-neg.

#15-#25: First appearance of Iron Fist (Danny Rand), Colleen Wing, and Misty Knight. Danny leaves Kun-lun seeking vengeance, but finally finds Harold Meachum a sad and broken old man who is eventually killed by someone else. The stories were popular enough to start a standalone series after #25. This run had way too much of Danny talking to himself.

#26: Featuring Hercules, going up against Typhon and Cylla (a new character that was never seen again!)

#27: Featuring Satana. A book named after her would cause all kinds of pearl-clutching in the modern age.

#28: Featuring the Legion of Monsters. Actually it's just Ghost Rider, Swamp Thing, Morbius, and Werewolf by Night investigating something weird in NYC.

#29-30 Featuring the Liberty Legion. Bucky pulls together a bunch of WW2-era pre-Marvel heroes to help stop the brainwashed Invaders.

#### Iron Fist v1 (1975)

15 issues. The most notable thing about this run is that it is written by Chris Claremont, around the time he started his more well-known X-Men run. This results in a bit of crossover - notably Colleen, Misty and Jean Grey are roommates for a while. The series didn't last long and Danny and his supporting cast were later merged into [Power Man and Iron Fist v1](/2024/07/cmr-luke-cage/#power-man-and-iron-fist-v1-1978).

Danny is seemingly killed at the end of PM/IF v1 and then that death was retconned in Namor v1. He does not have another regular ongoing until 2007!

#### Immortal Iron Fist (2007)

27 issues, 1 annual, 2 Orson Randall one-shots.

This was the first actual Iron Fist series that I read; before this one I had only seen him in ensembles or one-off guest appearances. It is also very very good. The first half by Brubaker and Fraction has the more highly-rated story arcs as compared to the second half by Swierczynski. This series greatly expounds on the mythology of the Iron Fist and Kun Lun. It introduces Orson Randall, the mentor to Danny's father and the previous Iron Fist before him. It also introduces the Book of the Iron Fist, which tells the stories of 66 previous Iron Fists. It also introduces six other "Capital Cities of Heaven" (in addition to Kun-Lun), and their Immortal Champions, equivalent to the Iron Fist. I think around 4 issues were one-off stories about previous Iron Fists.

#### Iron Fist: The Living Weapon (2014)

12 issues. 

Written and illustrated by Kaare Andrews. Some funky art, pretty good. First appearance of Pei, a young monk who eventually becomes an Iron Fist herself, and Sparrow, daughter of Lei Kung the Thunderer and eventual leader of Kun-Lun. It is revealed that Danny's father survived the fall from their Kun-Lun expedition but was trapped in a state between life and death and eventually merged with the discarded "The One" robot used to test Iron Fist aspirants. In an attempt to reunite with Danny's mother, The One accidentally summons a fiery god of death. Danny punches the fire god. Notably, this series gives Danny his new tracksuit-like costume design.

#### Iron Fist (2017)

15 issues.

This is either v5 or v5 and v6, depending on how you treat the confusing legacy re-numbering that happens in the middle of it. The series is by Ed Brisson and introduces Choshin and the Island of Liu Shiu, a colony of Kun-lun exiles seeking to retake the fabled city. There is an annoying continuity issue here [where Danny is housing a giant Shou-Lao dragon in his condo with no known explanation](/2024/07/1dxhaua/). The series ends with Danny and friends stopping an invasion of Kun-Lun.

#### One-shots and Limited Series

Danny has so many LS!

- Iron Fist v2 (1994) - 2 issue limited series. Terrible art. Just an excuse to rematch Iron Fist and Steel Serpent, returned from the dead.
- Iron Fist v3 (1996) - 3 issue limited series. Slightly better andmore vibrant art, still full of 90s excess. Nice Carlos Pacheco covers. Final fate of Danny's sister Miranda.
- Iron Fist/Wolverine (2000) - 4 issue limited series. Actually involves a of other heroes in supporting roles. Follows up on a dangling plot point from Heroes for Hire v1 (we'll cover that series in the next post!)
- Iron Fist v4 (2004) - 6 issue limited series. Danny goes off wandering alone, unsure about his direction in life or his role as a hero. Not very notable.
- Immortal Weapons (2009) - 5 issue limited series spinning out of *Immortal Iron Fist*. Each issue covers the back story of one of the other Immortal Weapons. Backup story is about one of Danny's students at the School of Thunder.
- Power Man and Iron Fist v2 (2011) - 5 issue limited series. Spinning out of [the Shadowland crossover](/2023/11/cmr-daredevil/#shadowland) where Danny met Victor Alvarez, a new hero who has taken the "Power Man" mantle. They investigate a case for former Heroes for Hire secretary Jennie Royce.
- Immortal Iron Fists (2017) - 6 issue limited series. Mostly a continuation of Kaare Andrews' *Iron Fist the Living Weapon*, except he has a different artist this time. Pei has stayed behind on Earth to become Danny's student and faces the greatest challenge of her life: high school. Also, Danny vs the daughters of Mara.
- Iron Fist: Heart of the Dragon (2021) - 6 issue limited series. The immortal dragons are being hunted down and Danny has to get the aid of other heroes to help stop an ancient evil. In the end, Danny gives up the power of Shou-Lao and becomes depowered.
- Iron Fist v7 - 5 issue limited series. Introduces a new Iron Fist: Lin Lie, who was previously the Sword Master. Instead of undergoing the Iron Fist trials, Shou-Lao chose to bestow his power upon Lin Lie directly. At the end of this series, Kun Lun is taken over by his brother Lin Feng.

#### Other Appearances

Danny most often associates with Luke Cage, so he appears in some of the series covered by [the previous post](/2024/07/cmr-luke-cage/).

He also often appears in ensemble series with street level heroes Luke Cage, Misty Knight, Colleen Wing, Daredevil, etc. I'll cover a few of those in the next post!

For most of the 2000s, Danny was also an Avenger.

This year is the 50th anniversary of Danny Rand's first appearance! I believe we are getting an Iron Fist 50th anniversary one-shot in August.

### MCU Comparisons

My main complaint about the Netflix Iron Fist series was that it focused too much on the family drama between the Meachums and the Rands and there is very little actual Kun-Lun mythology involved. It is a bit understandable, as Danny's early stories really center around the Meachums, but as the rest of his career shows, the Kun-Lun side had much more interesting stories to tell. 

I suppose focusing too much on Kun-Lun would have been difficult for a new audience and for the show's budget though. The ending of season 2 did hint towards exploring or adapting "The Last Iron Fist Story" from *Immortal Iron Fist*, but it now seems unlikely they'll ever follow-up on that.

Also, I felt like MCU Danny just wasn't very impressive as a martial artist to how I imagine Iron Fist should be as the champion of Kun-Lun.

Things that happened in the MCU that did not happen in the comics: Colleen and Danny being an item (Misty was Danny's love interest in the comics) and Colleen becoming an Iron Fist.
