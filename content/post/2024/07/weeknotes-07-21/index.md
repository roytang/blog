It is [a rainy weekend in Manila](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dglBgJSMr-E). We have [a tropical storm in the north enhancing the habagat](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1963260/storm-carina-keeps-strength-enhances-southwest-monsoon). This entry is coming in late because I kinda had a full day.

### The World

Donald Trump has officially been nominated as the Republican candidate, with JD Vance as his VP pick.

This weekend we had one of the biggest IT-related outages in recent memory. A faulty update from cybersecurity provider Crowdstrike trapped many Windows systems worldwide in a BSOD loop, affecting banks, airlines, etc. If like me, you are hearing of Crowdstrike for the first time, congrats. Their name will forever be tied to this outage. The newspaper headline this morning said airline outages continue today; it would have been extremely bad luck to have had a trip scheduled this weekend. (And to be IT support for one of the affected systems!)

### My Week

I had a bit of a less crowded week this time thankfully.

Monday was immunotherapy day; we finished earlier than usual. While waiting around at the hospital I had the opportunity to either be selfish/greedy or do a good deed and after some hesitation my better nature won out. I thought about including the details in these weeknotes, but right after the incident I saw a meme image on Mastodon about now doing good deeds for praise or recognition and I was like "Well, that's incredible timing." So we have this kinda vagueposting thing instead.

Tuesday and Wednesday the folks were out for an overnight trip so I had most of the house to myself. I used the opportunity to watch a movie lol.

Thursday and Friday were for minor regular errands that didn't take too long. I did get a bit stressed because undercapacity in our preferred local hospitals made scheduling one of the needed procedures a challenge, but we figured out a workaround eventually. I thought about asking the trivia team to attend an unplanned quiz night but was hit with the "too sponty for me bro" response.

The weekend was a bit more busy, mostly because one of the household members was feeling under the weather and I was constantly worrying and checking vitals and buying needed stuff.

The week was lax enough that I was able to get some stuff done on personal projects, including (but not limited to) some minor UI updates for this site that I've been wanting to do for a while (mostly for my benefit); these changes are not yet live.

On the blog: [A short post about Douglas Adams and technology](/2024/07/adams-technology/), and [a comic book post about Iron Fist](/2024/07/cmr-iron-fist/)!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: **Hades** is so close to being done, with only 3 achievements remaining, but because of the RNG inherent to roguelikes I have no idea how long it will take. In the meantime, I have reinstalled the Epic Game Store and GOG galaxy clients because I wanted to peruse my extensive libraries of free games on those platforms. (Okay, for GOG that could be done via web instead.)
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. I randomly decided to [stream some Snap Saturday morning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2PmH19Mu-Y), mostly because I haven't streamed anything in a while.
  
- **Reading**: More comics! Am very close to finishing an actual book as well, but I really only read it when I have to spend a long time in hospital waiting rooms lol.

- **Watching**: Watched [Godzilla vs Kong (2019)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/godzilla-vs-kong/), surprisingly the first film I've seen this month. One more monsterverse movie remains! Also took the time to catch up on some shows, finishing The Boys S4 and **The Acolyte S1**, and for some reason I also decided to start watching **Gravity Falls**. I have many thoughts, and am looking forward to writing another movies/tv post towards the end of the month.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,140 steps. Yes, good to be back in the saddle! The rainy Saturday almost made this challenging, but we got through it.

### Some Links of Interest

Not a lot this week:

    On how "doing good work" is not a good excuse for tolerating abusers in the tech industry (or any other industry)

### This Coming Week

Busy week, and not just errands wise!

The president is delivering his SONA tomorrow. Gonna be increased traffic in our area probably.

Quiz night on Wednesday!

Deadpool and Wolverine on Thursday! We are planning to watch with quiz night peeps.

On Friday will be the procedure we had trouble scheduling last week, hopefully everything goes well.

I believe Marvel is also making some official announcements next weekend at Hall H at SDCC, looking forward to that.
