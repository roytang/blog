title: Douglas Adams on How We See Technology
---

> “I've come up with a set of rules that describe our reactions to technologies:
> 
> 1. Anything that is in the world when you’re born is normal and ordinary and is just a natural part of the way the world works.
> 2. Anything that's invented between when you’re fifteen and thirty-five is new and exciting and revolutionary and you can probably get a career in it.
> 3. Anything invented after you're thirty-five is against the natural order of things.”

Assuming a more flexible definition of "invented" to include anything that became widespread/mainstream at the given time:

1. Cars, television, etc
2. The world wide web
3. Tiktok, algorithmic feeds, targetted advertising, bitcoin, LLMs, GenAI, ridiculously bloated frontend JS frameworks, etc
