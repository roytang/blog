Weeknotes coming in late in the day because I was out most of the day! Keeping this one a bit short, as I have an early errand tomorrow and I need to prep some stuff.

### The World

The UK had a parliamentary election last week, and the Conservatives that have been in power for 14 years just got trounched by Labour in a landslide. The new UK prime minister is Keir Starmer.

Biden continues to have a terrible time post-debate, despite a TV interview that they were hoping would quell the talk of replacing him as the Dem candidate.

### My Week

Yet another exhausting week! Most of it a continuation from last week: medical errands and paperwork, plus the addition of the house work I had to help with since our helper was still away. Luckily she was back by Friday. We had not been doing laundry as she was the only one who knew the wonkiness of our washing machine, so I was running out of clothes!

I was busy enough that I had to go out almost every day this past week, except Friday. This has meant a slowdown in my personal side projects, sadly.

On the blog: Wrote [my set recap of Outlaws of Thunder Junction](/2024/07/mtgotj-set-recap/), [a review of Civ6](/2024/07/civ6/), and [yet another complete marvel run post](/2024/07/cmr-luke-cage/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing a lot of **Hades**. I am close to completion, something like 6 achievements remain! Not sure how long it will take to grind them out though.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, sometimes **Eternal**. More **Modern Horizons 3** drafting, right up until quick drafts ended. I also did an MH3 paper draft today!
  
- **Reading**: Same, same.

- **Watching**: No new movies watched this week. Still trying to catch up with **The Boys S4** and **The Acolyte**.

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,068 steps. Good to hit my weekly target again! Unfortunately, I already know I am going to miss the next one, as I haven't had time for a lot of walking today and I plan to turn in early.

### This Coming Week

More paperwork, including an errand I've been dreading because I just know the queue is going to be ridiculously bad. Ugh, bureaucracy!

And more prep for the next immunotherapy session as well.

Hopefully things get easier after this week.
