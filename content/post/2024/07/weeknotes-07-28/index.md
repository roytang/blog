Ugh, yet another month is close to ending?!? Time flows like a river...

### The World

Following through from last weekend, the southern monsoon (Habagat) enhanced by now supertyphoon Carina tore through the northern part of the country for a good part of last week. Heavy rains lasted until Thursday, with Wednesday being the worst, drawing comparisons to [Typhoon Ondoy](/2009/09/ondoy/) in terms of [how much rainfall was dropped on Metro Manila](https://filipinotimes.net/latest-news/2024/07/24/carina-surpasses-ondoys-24-hour-rainfall-record-in-metro-manila/). Once again discussions of poor flood control and "resiliency" dominated our news cycle for a few days, soon to be forgotten.

Last weekend, shortly after I had typed up last week's weeknotes, US President Joe Biden withdrew his presidential candidacy and endorsed his VP Kamala Harris, in yet another plot twist in the final season of USA. This has galvanized the Democrat base and the GOP has gone crazy, with some even expressing buyer's remorse over Trump's VP pick JD Vance, [who is rumored to have had relations with furniture](https://www.dailydot.com/memes/vance-couch-meme/).

Just finished watching clips from Marvel's Hall H presentation. I must none of the announcements feel especially surprising given how the rumor mills have been churning, but I am of course hoping Marvel gets it act together after 2024. I did enjoy the previews for Brave New World so far, and it looks like they are going in a good direction.

### My Week

For most of the week I was basically stuck at home watching over one of my parentals who had incurred some kind of illness over the weekend. The heavy rains made it difficult to go anywhere. I did get done a bunch of stuff I wanted to do, so that's nice.

Trivia team had been scheduled to attend a quiz night last Wednesday but it was postponed on account of the weather. Luckily the accompanying movie screening on Thursday was able to push through.

Friday we had to travel to the far end of the Metro for a scheduled procedure. It was a bit of a challenge getting this schedule at all, so I was glad Carina didn't linger much longer in the country. The staff at the place we went to were very friendly, but it was still exhausting as we spent most of the day travelling there, waiting around, then travelling back home. I collapsed into bed as soon as I got home.

On the blog: I wrote about [teaching my nephew to play videogames](/2024/07/6yogamer/), [Modern Horizons 3](/2024/07/mtgmh3-set-recap/), and [Hades](/2024/07/hades/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: **Hades** is done! (Review linked above.) Hoping to start (or re-start) more single-player games soon.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Been grinding away at the Deadpool Diner event in Snap, which is just terrible enough that redditors are just advising people to retreat until they face a bot. Finally got Cassandra Nova this morning, so I'm done with that!
    - Microsoft recently announced upcoming price increases for PC Game Pass (boo!). The increase in the PH price is still a bit manageable, but this led me to review my inventory of free games on Epic and GOG and of course my Steam library and honestly I already have so many games on there, it might make sense to just drop Game Pass completely! Will think about it.
  
- **Reading**: Comics, etc. Still struggling to finish another actual book lol.

- **Watching**: I have finished watching **Gravity Falls**. Watched a few movies this week: [Godzilla X Kong: The New Empire (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/godzilla-kong-the-new-empire/), [Deadpool & Wolverine (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/deadpool-wolverine/), and finally [Morbius (2022)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/morbius/)!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) was a wash in terms of hitting the step target mainly because of the rains. Google Fit says I only walked a total of 32,380 steps.

A friend asked me why I don't just take my steps indoors when it's raining. I used to try this, but the problem is the house isn't very big and it would take me something like 30-40 laps on the first floor to hit just 1000 steps and this is just way too boring and repetitive for me so I stopped doing it.

I think it's reasonable to expect that the rainy season will mean I will be missing my step target more often. I am even kind of tempted to go back and check stats from previous years to see how much the rainy season affects my walking!

### Something I found

I found a set of 20-year old printouts with a list of names and other things:

I quickly figured out that this was a guide for Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, listing where to find collectible dog tags in-game. I never played that game, so presumably one of my brothers printed this out!

### Some Links of Interest

Nothing here this week. Hopefully I'll have more stuff next week!

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This Coming Week

This coming week is mostly prep for the next immunotherapy session the week after that, and my usual end-of-month errands.

On Wedneday we plan to attend the quiz night that was postponed from last week.

Oh, and I believe new Batman series drops on Prime Video at the start of the month; previews look good so I've been looking forward to that.
