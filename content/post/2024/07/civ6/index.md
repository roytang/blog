To this day **Sid Meier's Civilization VI** (released in 2016) remains [my #4 most played Steam game of all time](/page/stats/gaming/). (That's really #3 since that DOTA gameplay time on my account belongs to my brothers.) I have not actually played the game since March 2021. but I decided to write a review already!

### Stats and Completion

Total playtime: 459.7 hours.

Achievements: 174/320.

My achievement percentage ended up even worse than in Civ5, mostly because this game just has a lot more achievements. And the same problems apply: I don't really play scenarios that much and later in the game's lifecycle they even have several alternate game modes that I never got to try.

I believe I have won at least once with most of the game's available leaders (a whopping 77 leaders available!), except the ones from the Leader Pass, which released after I stopped playing. Now that I've seen how many leaders came in that last pack I'm tempted to play some more! Honestly just reviewing the achievement list makes me want to play some more! If only the games didn't take so much time! 

### Gameplay Changes

The major gameplay change from Civ5 are:

- Districts. This is the big one (it feels to me), allowing you to dedicate tiles to buildings of a specific type. It introduces a lot of interesting city layout decisions, and that's what it's all about isn't it?
- Civics Tree. This is a second tech tree focused on cultural improvements.
- Policy Cards. Instead of fixed government types, you are given a set of policy cards and you can select which ones to "equip" to form your government policies/effects. Discovering Civics can unlock new policy cards. Every time you unlock a new Civic, you can restructure your policy cards for free, or at any other time for a small cost.

There are a lot of other major changes of course, but the others feel more like incremental changes over the previous games.

The **Rise and Fall** expansion pack, released in 2018, added the concept of era score and golden/dark ages, making games a lot more swingy. Another new feature was the ability to unlock and appoint governors with different effects.

The **Gathering Storm** expansion pack, released in 2019. This game adds back Diplomatic Victory and the major feature is late game climate change caused by historical resource usage.

Each of the above packs of course added new civs and leaders. There were also a bunch of smaller content packs released with individual new leaders/civs. Later content packs like the 2020 **New Frontier Pass** and the aforementioned **Leader Pass** added even more leaders.

The game also has several alternate game modes you could apply to your games:

- Apocalypse: Increased risk of natural disasters
- Secret societies: Each civ can align with a "secret society" that provides different abilities. This was the alternate game mode I enjoyed the most, I almost always enable this.
- Dramatic Ages: Makes golden/dark ages even more swingy.
- Heroes and Legends: Allows civs to unlock mythical/legendary units with unique abilities.
- Monopolies and Corporations: Gives players more options for using luxury goods. I always enable this also, makes the late game more interesting.
- Zombie Defense: In addition to the usual gameplay, you have to defend from zombies. Not a fan of the idea, I think I've never tried it.
- Red Death: Battle royale mode. I never tried this either.

### Things I liked

- I loved the game in general of course (400+ hours played etc.) 
- I love the sheer variety of options especially with all the leaders and all the optional game modes, giving the game essentially almost infinite replayability. If I was stuck on a desert island with access to Civ6 and no other games, I'd still be pretty entertained.
- Also the game comes with a "strategic view" which is a more streamlined and cleaner UI with a very simplified cartoony map and a lot of the graphical 3d model stuff and animations removed, designed for much better performance. I love this mode and will play most of my games in this mode, it makes turns go much faster and I like how colorful the strategic view can be.
- I like the whole era score concept introduced in Rise and Fall and especially the timeline view that is updated whenever you accomplish something cool.

### Things I disliked

- How long games take to play. One would think I'd be used to this by now, but it's just worse in the modern era with so many other games to play!
- Religious victory can come out of nowhere with almost zero warning. I've had multiple games suddenly lost because I wasn't paying attention to religion. I'm often tempted to just disable religious victory! 
- Diplomatic victory can have a similar problem, but to a lesser extent since there's a periodic diplomatic vote that can tell you what's going on.
- Late game warfare continues to be super tedious.
- Great artists run out of use in the late game when you no longer have great work slots to spare. They should have given them some late game function maybe similar to rock bands.
- The Philippines still not appearing as a new Civ! So far among the SEA nations I believe Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam have been represented as major civs, with Indonesia even returning from Civ5.

### How I play Civ games

A lot of people play Civ games while doing a lot of extreme optimization and min-maxing (the term "yield porn" exists on the civ subreddit). But I've come to realize that I most enjoy the civ games when playing them like casual sandboxes, not really concerning myself with trying to min-max every single aspect of each decision. I do try to play as optimally as I can, and I try to beat the game on the higher difficulties at least once (there are achievements after all), but I would default to the normal/prince difficulty level as much as possible, and sometimes even play on chieftain if I just want to be chill. I just wanna build stuff yo.

### Multiplayer and Streaming

I did manage to play quite a few multiplayer games with friends for Civ6, much more than Civ5 at least, probably because we have better internet providers this time around. I'm still annoyed by simultaneous turns in multiplayer; since I tend to finish my turns very quickly, it makes me much more vulnerable to a late-turn surprise DOW and ambush.

I also streamed Civ6 a few times on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy). I have [a couple of videos up on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXgOGCS-686KV8qVWuqDYNDl).

### That's It!

Honestly, I am tempted to play some more Civ6 lol. Last month, an official announcement was finally made that Civ7 releases next year, looking forward to it!
