Bloomburrow previews starting soon, so I need to save up resources for the next set and will probably no longer be drafting **Outlaws of Thunder Junction**, time for a set recap!

### Set Notes

- My string of mediocre limited performance during the play booster era continues. I was actually doing a bit better early on in the season (my only trophy was my 4th draft), but as I kept trying other archetypes I hit a string of bad drafts and I ended the season at a poor 52.1% win rate.
- Despite the poor performance, set design and mechanics are great. "Committing a crime" especially is so good. 
- The draft archetypes might not be evenly balanced. The WG signpost uncommon feels so much better than the others I have lost so many games to it.
- Best performing archetype for me was WG, unsurprising.
- I really wanted UB  to work, I tried it so many times, mainly because I really enjoy it when I get [Intimidation Campaign](https://scryfall.com/card/otj/208/intimidation-campaign) going lol. It is super derpy though, and insisting on it probably contributed to the poor win rate for this archetype.
- There were some aggressive red-based decks I never got to draft. One almost mono-red deck killed me with like 3x prickly pair in a row and then all outlaws gain +2/+0!
- The format was reasonably fun, though I probably enjoyed MKM more.

### 7-x Sealed/Draft Decks

My only trophy draft for this set is actually almost monowhite! I just put in the green cards because I ran out of white playables.

### Next

I have currently moved on to **Modern Horizons 3** drafting, though quick drafts are about to end, so after that I might just save resources for **Bloomburrow**
