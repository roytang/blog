Nephew #2 (and his family) come visit us once every 2-3 weeks or so. I thought he's about the right age so early this year I started letting him try playing video games by hooking up the Switch to the downstairs TV. His cousins also play videogames, but he's the eldest one who doesn't have regular videogame access at home, so he's very eager. He is 6 years old. His 4 year old brother likes to watch but doesn't want to try playing yet.

I started him off with something I thought would be simple: *Super Mario World* via the SNES emulator on the Switch. It still ended up being fairly complicated and he was dying a lot at the start. Funny thing with a new gamer is how at the start he keeps looking down at the controller each time he has to press a button. 

Eventually I discover there is an "SP" version of the game on the Switch SNES emulator which starts the player off with the entire map unlocked and 99 lives and this was much better for him because we didn't need to unlock stages or save games and he go anywhere he wanted and could just do attempt after attempt at each stage until he tires of it. He did almost run out the 99 lives during one of the sessions!

He has gotten fairly good at the very first set of stages, though sometimes he ventures out to the later stages and often fails miserably. His favorite stage to go back to is *Yoshi's Island 4*, I think it's because if he misses a jump he doesn't die immediately and has a chance to survive in the water. I think he is able to finish this more often than not.

Despite thinking the controls would be quite easy for him, they are actually still quite complicated. Some things I have yet to get him to remember to do regularly:

- running. (I was a bit proud when at one point I was showing him how to do a stage and he told me to do the "hold B"!)
- using the regular jump instead of the spin jump for higher reach
- picking stuff up and throwing them
- jumping at the edge of a ledge instead of way too early

I'm not even going to attempt to explain to him how to use the cape to fly!

Generally I find that he has trouble with complex actions that require some combination of buttons or holding buttons etc. Also, he doesn't really pay attention to the HUD elements (he can already read), so I have to tell him when he's running low on lives or time is running out etc.

Some other games he has tried:

- Super Marios Bros (NES): I wanted him to try this because the simpler control scheme might be easier for him, but he wanted to go back to Super Mario World probably because of better graphics.
- Double Dragon II (NES): We tried this one time because his dad wanted to play coop with him and this was the best one we found. They kept falling off ledges, and the jump command in this game was A+B so he had to be constantly reminded how to do that.
- Super Mario Wonder (Switch): Played coop with his cousins one time when we managed to get everyone together. He didn't really understand how coop works and didn't help the others mostly just racing ahead to try to get to the flag first lol. The copy of the game has been borrowed by one of the cousins, so he hasn't had much solo time with this one.
- Mario Kart (SNES): Predictably, he just kept bumping into obstacles and heading the wrong way and finishing last (usually due to timing out).
- Super Mario Galaxy / Super Mario Sunshine (Switch): Just tried this with him last weekend, and it was way too much. I think in Galaxy he got confused by the rotating 3d perspective and in Sunshine, the control scheme was kind of complicated for him. The R/ZR commands change depending on a mode toggle via the X button which he kept accidentally pressing. And I had to explain to him which buttons were R and ZR! Who named these buttons! Also he didn't like that Mario got sent to jail in Sunshine lol.
- [Side Pocket](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1963260/storm-carina-keeps-strength-enhances-southwest-monsoon) (SNES). He was excited to play this one, but he initially called it "chess" lol. He said he knows about this because his *lolo* (the grandfather on the other side) often watches a guy called [Efren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efren_Reyes). He actually got this relatively quickly once I explained how to max the power of his shots, but he failed to hit the score target during the two games he played.

I thought it was interesting how difficult it was for a modern kid to adapt to videogames with a controller. I'm not sure if it's because he's more used to touchscreens? Previously his cousins had been letting him try out stuff like Roblox (using my iPad) and IDK how much trouble had there but I didn't get any complaints. Also, he can play Marvel Snap! (Not well, as he doesn't really understand the abilities of each card, but enough to get through games by himself, usually costing me rank!)

To be fair, I was I believe 8 or 9 when we got our first NES (and we had an Atari 2600 for a short while before that), so a few years older than him. My younger brother (4-5) was able to play some of the games though. We also had the advantage of playing for about 3 hours a week (my dad let us play for an hour each day on weekends including Friday), while Nephew #2 only gets like 30-60 minutes every 2 or 3 weeks, so we had lots more practice. Plus the fact that we started from using a simpler controller scheme (NES) for years before moving to more complicated ones, so it was a smoother learning curve. Today's modern gamers have to start out with controllers with 2 analog sticks, a d-pad and maybe 11 different buttons to remember!

Nephew #2 isn't the first pamangkin I tried to teach to play videogames. I used to have Niece #1 try out Lego City Underground on the Wii U and Little Big Planet on the PS3 when she was around the same age, though that was a challenge as well, and she didn't have gaming access at their home at the time either. 

I think not having the at-home access is a big factor; when we were kids we could basically just keep trying out stuff on the NES with different games and figure things out even without instruction manuals since the controls were so simple. I keep telling my brother to borrow my Switch since I'm not using it a lot these days so Nephew #2 can have more gaming practice time at home, but so far he has preferred to just let the kid game when they visit here. I do enjoy gaming with him when they visit, so that's nice. And him playing on the TV can be a nice spectator sport for the other adults too!

I'm looking forward to revisiting this in a few years to check progress!
