I finally "completed" **Hades** this week by getting all achievements!

I have been wanting to play this game for a long time and finally bit the bullet during a sale when Hades II was first released. I started playing the game on May 13 and even [streamed my first session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tXpsCEqaRUo&t=1s)! I got my first escape the next day and finished the main story on June 4th and the epilogue on July 1st, and the rest of the time was spent grinding out the final achievements.

Frankly this took way too much time than I expected, although I should have known better since it was a roguelike. I did enjoy the game very much; Supergiant has crafted an incredible roguelike experience here, though maybe grinding out the last few achievements was kind of a chore. Excellent story; I am not sure how accurate it is with regards to the source material, but the way it is presented in between the endless runs through the levels of hell is really good. The art style is fantastic and just what you'd expect from Supergiant. And there are so so many things to unlock - even with achievement completion I am still tempted to go back for that 32-heat run and the meaningless reward. Looking forward to eventually playing the sequel in like 5 years maybe lol.

Also, I love it when a roguelike gathers so many stats for you:

This game also kind of blocked any progress on other single-player gaming as whenever I had time I would just do a run or two of Hades instead of either of the RPGs I already had running. After 3 months of playing, I am happy to put down the game and move on!
