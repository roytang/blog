### The World

After a disastrous first round of voting, a leftist/progressive alliance has managed to defeat the far-right in the the French parliamentary elections.

A mere hours ago, shots were fired at a rally in Pennsylvania and Donald Trump was rushed from the stage, his fist in the air and his ear bloodied. Reports say he is fine and the sniper has been killed. Details are still sketchy at this time, but none of this can possibly be good.

### My Week

One of the most exhausting weeks I've had in a while, though most of it was the first three days. I was out most of the day Sunday, and had to go out early in the morning Monday for a government bureaucracy thing that I had been dreading all week. As expected, it took all day and all told I was out of the house more than 10 hours running on very little sleep. It's actually a bit concerning that this exhausted me so much, since that's much less hours than I used to do on a regular basis back when I was working full time, but then again, maybe being in hours-long queues just has that kind of effect on me. Tuesday had more errands to do that took longer than expected, and that just piled on from the previous days. Wednesday was a bit lighter, and I took the opportunity to get some extra sleep.

By Thursday I was ready to do something a bit more relaxing, so the trivia team went out [for a last minute quiz night](/2024/07/don-conejos-04/). 

Friday was rest. I also managed to hit the 2000 day streak on Duolingo:

Saturday we had to go to our regularly-scheduled doctor's checkups (including the rare medical checkup for myself!)

On the blog: No other blog posts this past week! I will write some more next week (or so I promised myself.)

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing **Hades** to the detriment of other single-player games. Five achievements remain, but they may take a while to grind out.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. I missed Infinite this past month on Snap though.
  
- **Reading**: Same, same. More comics, etc. Iron Fist post should be coming this week!

- **Watching**: No new movies watched this week. Almost caught up with **The Boys S4** and **The Acolyte**!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I only walked a total of 30,954 steps. Sunday to Tuesday were lost due to a general lack of time, and that just kept unmotivated for the rest of the week; I only hit the 10k target during Wednesday, though Thursday was close. Hoping to get back into it this week.

    I found this fascinating because I always wondered how the stored value cards used for our local trains worked. To avoid card tampering I always assumed there was some sort of server tracking the value of each card, although internet latency would be a challenge. This article implies that typically the cards will store the data locally and be secured by some level of encryption instead.

### This Coming Week

Yet another immunotherapy session tomorrow, which means we'll be out most of the day. 

Might do another quiz night on Thursday, not sure yet.

At least the coming week looks less busy, although these medical errands have a bad habit of coming up unexpectedly...

### Where Am I

Honestly feeling a bit lost and worried about the world and the future and whatnot. I am sure I'm not alone!
