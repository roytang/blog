Bloomburrow releases next week on Magic Arena, so it's time to move on from **Modern Horizons 3**, let's do a set recap!

I was not originally planning to play MH3 on Arena, but then I got invited to a paper draft in mid-July so I figured I needed some practice and did a few. I restricted myself to Quick Drafts (and this week's Midweek Magic) to maximize games played.

### Set Notes

- I played fewer events than a standard set, for a period of about 2.5 weeks (the quick draft period). I did play more events than the last supplemental set ([LOTR](/2023/08/mtgltr-limited-recap/)) and got a much better win rate overall.
- When I started out the set felt super complicated and I had trouble getting a foothold and dealing with big dumb eldrazi. At first I was using mostly black-based strategies. Then I leaned in to the big, dumb eldrazi plan, trying out RG and UG decks and started doing a bit better. I only discovered the Magic of UW Energy Fliers later in the season; the bots always seemed to leave this strong color pair open and it was easy to put together some good decks.
- I ended up with a win rate that was actually slightly better than the last 3 standard sets, which is surprising since I played less than half the number of drafts. This implies I was able to figure out this format more quickly despite it being a relatively more complicated set!
- The lower number of events means I wasn't able to try some of the archetypes and honestly I think I never even faced the Boros Energy Aggro one on Arena!
- As mentioned, it's a complicated set mechanics-wise, which is expected of a Modern Horizons set. But it honestly turned out so well and a lot of the moving parts worked well together and it's a nice fun draft environment where crazy things can happen. I suspect it's not evenly balanced though; black and red feel a bit weaker overall, though they do have some good decks that you can put together when the right cards come up.

### 7-x Draft Decks

I did not get any trophies D: 

I didn't even get a 6 until my last day of quick drafts!

### Magic Arena Stats

Will add to this section if/when the stats email comes in.

### Streaming videos

I did NOT stream any MH3!

### Paper Draft

I split a box with some people and we did a draft, which was probably a bad idea as MH3 is quite expensive. Our draft format is a bit "casual" so we do a modified format where after drafting our 3 packs, everyone gets to open an additional pack to add to their sealed pool. This results in slightly more powerful decks than one would face on Arena!

I drafted a decent RG deck and the bonus pack rewarded me with a second [Writhing Chrysalis](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/208/writhing-chrysalis) and [Titans' Vanguard](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/206/titans-vanguard), both of which were excellent in my deck.

Unfortunately, I did not win the event (we just did the 3 Swiss rounds), only going 2-1:

- R1: 1-2 vs RW Energy Aggro: This was super close and I lost the 3rd game to a surprise topdecked [Suppression Ray](https://scryfall.com/card/mh3/260/suppression-ray-orderly-plaza). I had never played this archetype before on Arena, so some of the cards were completely new to me!
- R2: 2-0 vs WB Midrange: Just powered through with my much larger creatures.
- R3: 2-0 vs Temur Nadu: Opp had a poor draw both games.

Not much value in my rare drafts or prize packs either. Eh, it was a fun draft but the set is really way too expensive and I'm glad I was able to try it on Arena!
