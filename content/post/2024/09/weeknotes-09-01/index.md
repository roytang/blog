I am writing this post in advance of Sunday because I will not be at home and will be without a stable internet connection for a few days (more on that below). Hopefully my automated posting thingy works correctly and this is published on time! These weeknotes will also he shorter than usual.

### My Week

Four working days this week; slightly less busy but also came with a surprise ending.

Monday: National holiday.

Tuesday: Immunotherapy day. The holiday the previous day meant the hospital had two days' worth of patients today, so we were assigned a later-than-usual slot and ended up staying most of the day.

Wednesday: Relax a bit. Trivia team planned to attend a quiz night today, but I opted out because I didn't like the venue or the topics. They finished 3rd place. I was tempted to solo attend this other quiz night which I only found out about late in the evening; we had a GC for the venue which was about to expire so "sunk cost fallacy" made me want to use it. But it was a rainy afternoon/evening and ultimately it didn't feel like the challenging commute would be worth it.

Thursday: Grocery run. Too much time spent gaming on the PC (see below).

Friday: Brought one of the patients to a consultation with a doctor for an infection that was getting worse. Doctor said the patient needed to be admitted so that meds could be administered via IV. We are scheduled to go in Saturday evening and are told the stay will be at least 4 days. I am hoping it doesn't go past a week. These sudden disruptions remind me why it's just very challenging for me to return to full-time work right now.

On the blog: Nothing last week other than the previous weeknotes!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finally installed **Starfield** on PC game pass and I know it had middling reviews but I am really into it. It has some obvious flaws, but I am easily drawn-in by large numbers of quests apparently. I think I've played something like 15 hours over the past 3 days. It's too bad the hospital stay is going to interrupt my run; hopefully I don't forget where I was in the game when I get back!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. 
  
- **Reading**: I started a new Discworld but haven't gotten too into it yet. Reading more comics etc.

- **Watching**: In the middle of the week I watched [High Fidelity (2000)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/high-fidelity/).

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked at least 50k steps. I don't have the exact total because I'm writing this Saturday morning! I missed one day due to it being very rainy, and then general busy-ness Friday and Saturday means not much walking on those days. That number of steps is pretty good all things considered.

### This Coming Week

As mentioned, I expect to be in the hospital and without a stable internet connection for most of the week. Hopefully we are back home by next weekend!
