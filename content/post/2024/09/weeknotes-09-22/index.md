I missed last week's weeknotes! This is the first time I've missed a week [since I started back in January 2020](/2020/01/weeknotes-01-12/)!

### My Two Weeks

The reason I missed the weeknotes last week was that on Sunday the 15th I woke up to one of the parentals needing to be brought to the ER. After some tests, they needed to be admitted to the hospital for observation, so we had very little notice. I had someone bring us stuff from home, but that meant foregoing my laptop and a charger for my iPad. We ended up staying at the hospital for 3 days until Wednesday. I don't like doing my blog posts on mobile, and by the time we got home it felt too late to do the weeknotes, so I figured I'll just skip it for the first time.

Everything is fine with the parents (for now), despite the two hospital stays already in the same month. We have a bunch of other tests to be done, but we are hoping for good results. The constant medical concerns can get a bit overwhelming though. And all of this has of course been a challenge financially. I learned during this most recent stay that in-patient lab tests are much more expensive than out-patient ones!

The rest of the past couple of weeks was largely unremarkable; me trying to get back into my routines, doing more errands for the parentals, banking stuff, and so on. 

Oh, I did get my visa application back! Happy to report that I am approved for a multiple entry visa to Japan! Submitting an application while I am unemployed gave me some anxiety but we made it somehow. I am planning to go on a trip with friends later this year; hopefully my filial duties don't make it complicated.

Also, I had an incident a couple of weeks ago where I absent-mindedly withdrew cash from an ATM and got the card back but DID NOT PICK UP THE CASH! This is how I learned that if you don't get the cash immediately, the ATM will swallow it back up after a short period. After a convo with the bank's support and about a week's wait for "investigation", we were able to get the money credited back.

On the blog: I wrote about [archiving other people's posts](/2024/09/archiving-other-posts/) and also [another entry in my complete marvel run](/2024/09/cmr-iron-man-2/)!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing **Starfield** when I can, somehow already over 35 hours in!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. Since I was away from home a lot, I missed a lot of Arena dailies and am unlikely to finish this season's mastery pass. Also decided to start playing **Street Fighter VI** again for some reason; even managing to win some online matches every so often!
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics.

- **Watching**: Watched [Poor Things (2023)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/poor-things-2023/) earlier this week, and to balance that out later I watched Justice League: Crisis on Infinite Earths (2024) Parts [One](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/justice-league-crisis-on-infinite-earths/) [Through](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/justice-league-crisis-on-infinite-earths-2024-1/) [Three](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/justice-league-crisis-on-infinite-earths-2024/).

### Walking and Health

From Sep 8 (Sunday) to Sep 14 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 64,475 steps. Most of the week was good for walking, but I missed Saturday because of rains.

From Sep 15 (Sunday) to Sep 21 (Saturday), I only managed 32,012 steps. While I was only in the hospital for half of the week, I decided to take it easy for the rest of the week.

### Some Links of Interest

I still have a good amount of links saved for processing, but managed to go through some over the past couple of weeks:

- [Nobody wants to use any software  — Character](https://www.characterworks.co/blog/nobody-wants-to-use-any-software)

    > Nobody wakes up in the morning thinking, "I want some software."

    (Okay, probably this isn't *technically* true since games are software, but I get the point.

- [We're losing our digital history. Can the Internet Archive save it?](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240912-the-archivists-battling-to-save-the-internet)

    While I do believe the IA is fundamentally useful, it's still highly centralized and we could use more backup archiving services elsewhere (probably outside of the US)

- [Wikipedia is facing an existential crisis. Can gen Z save it? | Stephen Harrison | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2024/sep/12/wikipedia-generation-z-young-editors-chatbots)

- [Neither Elon Musk Nor Anybody Else Will Ever Colonize Mars | Defector](https://defector.com/neither-elon-musk-nor-anybody-else-will-ever-colonize-mars)

    I like the science here but this seems super pessimistic. I agree it is quite unlikely that this happens in our lifetimes (and by EM is even more unlikely), but I like to be hopeful about the outside chance of some random science breakthrough making things possible.

- [How to Monetize a Blog](https://modem.io/blog/blog-monetization/)

    I was unprepared for how unhinged this would get towards the end

- [The secret inside One Million Checkboxes | eieio.games](https://eieio.games/essays/the-secret-in-one-million-checkboxes/)

    Excellent story about kids just hacking into things that are of no real consequence for fun

- [Goodbye.Domains](https://goodbye.domains/)

    A website with stories of parked domains that never got used. This was more entertaining than I expected.

- [Is My Blue Your Blue?](https://ismy.blue/)

    > "Your boundary is at hue 173, greener than 63% of the population. For you, turquoise is blue."

- [Why A.I. Isn’t Going to Make Art | The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art)

    Ted Chaing knocks it out of the park here, and there are far too many quotable parts in this essay to do it justice.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

I am looking forward to soooo many things in the next few weeks:

- Agatha All Along and Penguin have already started airing, though I haven't gotten into them yet.
- Sep24: Terry Bogard is dropping in SF6! I have not actually purchased this year's season pass (I usually wait for them to be on deep discount before considering it), but I am super tempted for Terry!
- Sep24?: Duskmourne drops on Magic Arena!
- Sep26: New Zelda game is dropping! 
- Ranma 1/2 and Dandadan animes in the first week of October
- Some movies I was looking forward to coming to streaming in late Sep/early Oct (The only question is when I actually get time to watch them!)
