### The World

There are of course, still a lot of things happening like Israel expanding the mideast conflict, Trump being ridiculous, Russia threatening nukes etc. But I want to note something from the open source tech world this time, with [Wordpress/Automatic's Matt Mullenwegg stirring up unnecessary drama over WPEngine](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/27/wordpress-vs-wp-engine-drama-explained/). It feels like yet another big step in Wordpress and Automatic's decade-long decline.

### My Weeks

I have somehow managed to have a mostly "normal" week! That included an immunotherapy session early in the week and a bunch of other follow-up stuff for other concerns.

I have also somehow managed to get back into some of my daily rhythms and resume some of the personal projects I want to do (most of which involve cleaning/organizing a lot of stuff!)

Saturday we had some extended family come over for a visit because they were in town for a wedding. The house always gets lively around this time.

Friday just after lunch our home internet died. It had the whole blinking-red-LOS-light-on-the-modem issue, which is a thing we experience about once a year on average I think. I reported it immediately, and was told a technician can come check Saturday afternoon. They actually got here a bit early before lunch and checked the modem, then went out and checked some of the neighborhood cables then came back and hooked everything up and it was fine and apparently something had gotten damaged down the street, which I think is the second time this has happened.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing **Starfield** when I can; trying to finish a bunch of faction quest lines before advancing the main quest, as they do.
    - Purchased **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom**! Have not started playing it yet.
    - **Frostpunk 2** also came out this week on PC game pass and I installed it because I want to try it, but have not yet found the time.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**. I did [a couple of drafts of the new set Duskmourne ](https://www.youtube.com/,watch?v=5cakPuXbLAU), hopefully I can draft some more this week. Still playing more **Street Fighter VI**, though my win rates are horrible. My regular gaming group has been playing **Root** and **Wingspan** games async over Steam lately.
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics. Well, I did get some book reading done during the "no internet" or "low cell signal" parts of the week, but progress is slow.

- **Watching**: I have spent the past week binging the last 3 seasons of **Only Murders in the Building**; I am enjoying it and it is good background watching and hopefully I can finish the last season in time for my semi-regular movies/TV reviews posts. This weekend I also managed to watch [The Fall Guy (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/the-fall-guy-2024/) and [Argylle (2024)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/argylle/).

### Walking and Health

From Sep 22 (Sunday) to Sep 28 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 70,161 steps. Laziness was overcome! Though I did find that most of my steps kept coming later in the day as the week went on. It was good to get back into the rhythm after the irregular last few weeks I've had.

    > One day, James Williams—the former Google strategist I met—addressed an audience of hundreds of leading tech designers and asked them a simple question: “How many of you want to live in the world you are designing?” There was a silence in the room. People looked around them. Nobody put up their hand.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

- We are waiting on some biopsy test results coming in this week and are hoping for a good outcome.
- Looking forward to some new stuff dropping on streaming in October (Again, the question is when will I have time to watch them.)
