The other day some friends and I were talking about the idiosyncracies of websites by Japanese companies, and I remembered a post [I had previously shared on this site](/2023/12/00f25e9ad99c267e3bc5aa290a250916/) about how Japanese personal websites had a unique aesthetic as well and I wanted to share it with the group chat. But to my sadness, I found that the article **"Browsing the Eastern Side of the Personal Web"** originally hosted at https://www.bikobatanari.art/posts/2023/east-west-website-culture was no longer available. In fact, the entire domain is already dead. I shrugged at the [link rot](/2021/02/link-rot/) and checked the wayback machine and was surprised that the website was "excluded from the wayback machine", presumably at the request of the original domain owner.

I was still able to find [an archived copy of the page via archive.md](https://archive.md/FqkSP) and have backed it up locally. But that led me to asking: is it right for me to keep a copy of this post if the original writer has expressly intended to remove it from the internet? And furthermore, can I put up a copy of the page on my own site for sharing to other people?

I do think we should respect people's ["right to be forgotten"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_be_forgotten) and can understand why some people might want to wipe their internet presence completely (though it's definitely not something I would do). But for a post like this that got a good amount of shares (there was even [a Hacker News comment thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38534153)) and doesn't really contain sensitive personal information, it kind of feels like that kind of content takes on a life of its own independent of the author and that the people who have read it also have a right to preserve it especially if they found it insightful or meaningful. It's kind of like if an author published a book and people enjoyed it and it sold well but then later he didn't like it anymore and wanted people to destroy their copies.

One thing this highlights to me is how archive.org/the wayback machine can be unreliable as a centralized single source of backups and we really should have more archival sites and maybe more personal archiving efforts like the one I am contemplating. Especially when the Internet Archive might be in trouble because of [an unforced error re: Controlled Digital Lending during the pandemic](https://www.wired.com/story/internet-archive-loses-hachette-books-case-appeal/).

Speaking of archiving other people's posts, [niche post-twitter social media platform cohost has announced they are shutting down](https://cohost.org/staff/post/7611443-cohost-to-shut-down). My only concern here is that I have a number of links previously shared that originated from cohost, so I probably want to preserve those too, especially [this excellent 21-part (so far) series on the history of the MTG metagame](https://cohost.org/rc/tagged/compleat%20history%20of%20the%20magic%20the%20gathering%20metagame). Seems like most of the posts are also on the wayback machine, but as mentioned above it is probably a better idea to have my own personal backups anyway. Will probably look into it once cohost goes into read-only mode in October.

I am thinking about all of this because ever since Twitter was bought out by EM I have been thinking about having an archive of Twitter threads that I enjoyed and host them here on this website somewhere. I might want to do something similar for posts that have been lost to time like the one mentioned above. What obligations do I have to the original poster, aside obviously from crediting them and maybe linking to their Twitter profile or whatever?

Occasionally I find some weird ad spammy website that mirrors content from this site (probably via the RSS feed) obviously for farming clicks or somesuch. I mostly don't care and just leave them be (and I haven't encountered it again since I delisted from Google), but it does give me a feeling of ick, and I don't want to give that feeling of ick to other people if I host their content here. 

Maybe I'll just add a disclaimer and an offer to remove the content if requested? That also feels a bit ick since it is opt-out, which is not unlike the controversy surrounding AI scrapers and such. Except I would be doing the archiving manually as a person (does that matter?) and asking for permission from individual posters probably won't scale. And in some cases like the bikobatanari.art link mentioned at the top of this post it's impossible since without the website IDK hot to contact the author.

I don't yet know the answers to the questions I raised here; I need to think about it some more. Worst case is I just archive the content locally and not have it be online, though that seems like a waste.
