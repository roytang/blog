### A September Tradition?

As the title implies, I spent (almost all of last week) in the hospital yet again fulfilling my filial duties as a watcher.

We were admitted Saturday evening and discharged Saturday afternoon, so that is almost 7 full days of a hospital stay.

This had sadly become a bit of a September tradition. Last year, we were in the hospital [in the first week of September for a surgery](/2023/09/2023-week-36/) and in 2021 [we were admitted in late September for COVID](/2021/10/weeknotes-10-10/). We managed to avoid the curse in '22 and hopefully again in'25.

Since I was in the hospital all week, my activities were severely limited. And this hospital offers no wifi, which made things more challenging. The last time we were here, I made the mistake of spending my time watching streaming episodes and YT videos and that used up my mobile data allocation very quickly. This time I decided to restrict my internet usage mostly to text/image-based browsing.

Aside from my watcher/caregiver duties, I spent my time mostly browsing the web/RSS feeds, reading comics, and playing Marvel Snap! I opted not to bring my Switch this time as I really wasn't in the mood for it. I also brought a sketch pad hoping to reignite my sketching hobby, but I ended up not cracking it open at all. I did bring a laptop, but given the limited internet availability I only used it occasionally for updating some online things. Not even blogging while I was there! I could have read a book, but noooo comics are much more interesting!

I was sharing the room with someone who was watching cable TV all the time, and that meant I got a greater-than-usual exposure to all the nonsense happening in local news and politics. I mean, I am aware of most of it, but having a daily news show constantly shout details at us reminds us how ridiculous the whole Alice Guo, Quiboloy, Sara Duterte, etc situations are. The country was also hit with massive rains and a typhoon for most of the week, most of which we didn't feel holed up in our hospital room. (I did have to turn up the aircon temp because the rains were making the nights very chilly.)

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked around 30k steps. The hospital grounds are fairly expansive and I could have taken longer walks, but I didn't want to be away from the patient for too long. Hopefully I can get back into the regular habit this week!

### Some Links of Interest

Still nothing this week. I have saved a bunch of stuff, but haven't had time to process them yet. Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

### This Coming Week

IDK yet what to expect for the week, other than trying to get back into my routines. There are some post-hospital-stay things to be done, we'll need to figure it out.
