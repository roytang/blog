title: 'New Year''s Checklist 2024: Things I''m Looking Forward To'
toc: true
---

Something I've gotten used to as the New Year rolls in: make a checklist of things to do and things I'm looking forward to for the new year.  This is my personal list, but maybe you'll enjoy going through it too. Check out the [new-years-checklist tag](/tags/new-years-checklist/) for previous years.

### New year reminders

These are general reminders that I think anyone would find useful. (I generally copy stuff over, but the list changes a bit every year.)

- Count your blessings for the past year and be grateful
- Change your passwords
- Throw away a few things you no longer need
- Audit your financials -- where is your money going, how much do you owe, how much are you earning, where should you invest, etc
    - Review your recurring luxury costs (Netflix, etc) and evaluate whether you still really need them
- Pick up your keyboard and shake out all the grime that's gathered there over the past year
- Choose something from the past year that you're going to stop watching or doing or move on from
- Eat your favorite food. Or ice cream. Ice cream is great
- Replace 2023 calendars
- Digital housekeeping
    - Delete all files downloaded 2021 or earlier
    - Clean up the photos on your phone, tablet and computer
    - Backup/archive all important content
    - Export your data from platforms like Google, FB, Instagram and Twitter
- Follow up on the people who owe you money or things
- Forgive those who have wronged you
- Speak truth to power
- Be kind
- Reach out to your friends more often
- Relax, give yourself room to breathe and grow.
- Buy a new toothbrush
- Quit Twitter, run your own blog, write anything you want

### My specific goals

- Site changes:
    - General redesign. This was also on last year's list and I have done some work on it, but nothing I'm ready to release.
    - Notes cleanup (will elaborate on this in a future blog post)
    - Collections (this too!)
    - So many other minor things I want to do
- General room cleaning. Specifics:
    - Go through the boxes behind the bed, toss out what isn't needed
    - Go through the drawers
    - Toss out at least 6 booster boxes worth of MTG draft chaff
    - Figure out what to do with the SmartThings things
- Archival work
    - Continue/finish [scanning old photographs](/2023/04/old-photographs/) (this effort kind of stalled later in 2023)
- Cash out at an Arena open. I failed this last year!
- Gamedev:
    - I am generally not feeling up to the weekend game jams anymore, but I will still put the Ludum Dare's on my list
        - Ludum Dare 55 (Apr12-Apr14)
        - Ludum Dare 56 (Oct04-Oct07)
    - Do a yearlong gamedev project: This is the approach I want to try this year. Details to follow.
- Travel to Japan (Nov) - a trip with friends, still in the planning stages

### Entertainment

#### Games

New releases I'm looking forward to:

- Hey, nothing in particular! FFVII Rebirth is coming out early this year, but I still don't have a PS5 so it may be a while before I get to play that.

Older releases I want to play:

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- --> | <!-- --> |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------|
| Tales of Xillia 2 | PS3 | RPG | carried over from 2022! |
| The Witcher 3: GOTY | Steam | RPG | carried over from 2023 |
| Wasteland 3 | Steam | RPG | carried over from 2023 |
| Persona 5 Tactica | PC Game Pass | RPG | |

Huh, not bad. Might have more "free" gaming time I can allot to whatever.

#### TV

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Jan10 | Echo | Disney+ |
| Feb22 | Live-Action Avatar TLA | Netflix |
| Feb27 | Shogun | Disney+ |
| Apr12 | Fallout | Prime Video |
| Apr?? | Star Trek Discovery S5 | ??? |
| TBA | X-Men 97 | Disney+ |
| TBA | The Acolyte | Disney+ |
| TBA | Star Wars Skeleton Crew | Disney+ |
| TBA | Agatha | Disney+ |
| TBA | What If S3 | Disney+ |
| TBA | Penguin | HBO |

#### Movies

I am listing movies that look like they might be of interest, but I suspect I won't be watching most of these in the cinema and will wait for a home/streaming release.

| <!-- -->    | <!-- -->    | <!-- --> |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| Feb02 | Argyle | |
| Feb14 | Madame Web | |

#### Books

I'm always reading older books, and not a lot of them these days, so it's rare to have a section for books here, but [Stormlight Archive](/tags/stormlight-archive/) book 5 comes out in December!

### Others

Once again, my goals for the year remain unambitious. I may or may not try to pick up new work. I'll be happy
