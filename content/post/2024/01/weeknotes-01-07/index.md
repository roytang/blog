title: 'Weeknotes 2024-01-07: The New World Struggles To Be Born'
---

It is a new year! Still feels the same though. 

Apparently I am keeping the weeknotes format more or less the same this year (or maybe I'll change my mind later, who knows!)

### A Quote

> "The old world is dying, and the new world struggles to be born: now is the time of monsters."

### My Week

I tried to have a chill week, though I knew as before I even changed the wall calendars that there were some medical errands that needed to be done in prep for next week; these took up most of Thursday and Friday. There were the usual end-of-month stuff (paying bills, checking finances, etc), some end-of-year stuff (doing backups, archiving, trying to collect debts). 

On the blog: As is my traditional new year activity, I wrote [a 2023 year in review](/2024/01/2023-year-in-review/) and [a checklist for 2024](/2024/01/2024-checklist/). These things always take me a while to put together, especially the stats in the yearnotes! I have not yet gotten started on any of the things I want to do for 2024.

### A Photo

{{% photos 2024 %}}

For years we've been using these Chinese calendars that had these times and numbers around the date, and I just learned that these are supposed to be information about the tides for that day; my dad says it's to help fishermen decide when to do their thing? IDK how accurate the projections for an entire year are though!

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Throughout the week I dabbled a bit in some older indie games (mostly because of this book I was reading, see below), but yesterday I started playing **Persona 5 Tactica**. I [streamed the first 1.5 hours of the game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7z4AQhSv_Do)!
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.

- **Reading**: Progress on my Doctor Strange run is going slowly. Finished reading [a book about Spelunky](/2024/01/spelunky/)! Started reading a new novel!

- **Watching**: Kicked off the new year by watching 3 more Fast and Furious films this week: 2 Fast 2 Furious (2003), The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift (2006), Fast & Furious (2009). I have been warned that the series gets more crazy/nonsensical as it goes on! Also finished watching Live Action YYH this week.

### Walking

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 63,543 steps, which is short of the usual 70k-per-week target, but that's fine because I included Sunday Dec 31 under my holiday hiatus. The real challenge begins this coming week!

There should be lots of different, human-scale alternative experiences on the internet that offer up home-cooked, locally-grown, ethically-sourced, code-to-table alternatives to the factory-farmed junk food of the internet. And they should be weird."

### Site Changes

- Letterboxd import now also syndicates the movie reviews to Mastodon
- Minor UI fixes
- Still going through and cleaning up/archiving old content as needed. I plan to write about this effort soonish/at some point.

### Things I've been thinking about

New beginnings, fresh start, collecting debts, formatting, dread, gamedev, fantasizing about being rich, real estate transactions, living your best life.

### Looking Forward To

Echo drops this week!

The next Geekfight League game is this week, but it's on a topic most of the team is unfamiliar with. We are trying to assemble some outsiders to help, but I probably won't be attending this one myself.
