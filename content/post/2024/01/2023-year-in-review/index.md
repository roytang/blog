toc: true

This is a personal year in review. You can check the [yearnotes tag](/tags/yearnotes) for previous years-in-review. Last year's review is [here](/2023/01/2022-year-in-review/).

### Essay-writing section

Last year I said that "2022 felt like an extension of 2021" and actually, 2023 ended up being more of the same I think.

For the world, it was another challenging year. The Israel and Hamas conflict added yet another geopolitical hotspot on top of Russia's still ongoing war with Ukraine. Elon Musk presided over the demise of Twitter. Record-breaking writer and actor strikes shut down Hollywood for a few months. Lots of layoffs in the tech world. Another year of record-high temperatures. Trump's legal troubles escalate. Elon and Zuck promised us a cage match and never pushed through. PinoyExchange suddenly shut down! "AI" / LLMs became the new big tech bubble / scam.

There were practically no more Covid restrictions in the country this year, though I still mask whenever I go to any crowded indoor place. I still stayed at home a lot though. Despite my being careful, I had [my second bout of Covid in October](/2023/10/2023-week-40/). No idea where I got it from, but at least no one else in the house got it too

In July, [my phone was stolen](/2023/07/stolen-phone/).

In September, there was a big fire in our subdivision in the early morning, apparently someone was running an illegal garments shop. It made the news cycle for a couple of weeks, and the barangay outpost guarding the "crime scene" was only dismantled in the last week of 2023.

Also in September, I spent a week in the hospital taking care of my mom who underwent surgery.

In November and December, I had to deal with a bunch of government bureaucracy hoping to get some financial assistance for upcoming family medical expenses, failing miserably.

Late in the year, my brother gifted us a new ref! The previous one was still working fine but was more than 20 years old - we had brought it over from the old house when we moved here in 2001. The new one promises to be more energy efficient, and sure enough, our electricity bill for December was lower by a nontrivial amount! 

Financially, my savings dipped a bit, as could be expected, but the overall situation remains stable. This year's expenses were a bit higher than last year, mostly because I chipped in a bit to help with family medical expenses. Other than family stuff, my only major expenses of the year were replacing the stolen phone and also [buying new glasses](/2023/02/progressives/) early in the year. (I did also take a trip to Singapore early this year, but the flight expenses were booked late 2022.)

Professionally, this was another hiatus year for me (see work stats below), same as last year. Repeating from last year: privilege, tired of capitalism, [wandering through life finding interesting things](/2021/06/life-philosophy/), etc. In last year's post I mentioned that "I have been thinking of already looking for new part-time or full-time work this coming year"; that did not come to pass. I also mentioned that "I do worry that maybe taking a third hiatus year in a row would be like crossing a rubicon that I can never come back from," which I guess I'm going to find out if that was true. I have still been thinking about looking for work again, but I can't make any promises.

Some projects I can talk about publicly: I [started scanning old family photographs](/2023/04/old-photographs/) and [I moved the Triviastorm trivia bot to Mastodon](/2023/02/triviastorm-mastodon/) after Twitter started to break down.

I still felt like 2023 was a bad year overall for me, mostly due to the family medical issues that cropped up. (Not keen on sharing too many details but I do talk about this a bit in [Being Mortal](/2023/12/being-mortal/).) It's possible that I just let that sort of thing weigh too heavily on me though; there were also a lot of good things that happened to me this year; a lot of it was getting to see old friends and relatives more often.

### 2023 In Numbers

Once again, the main reason this post took a while to come out is that I took some time to put these stats together.

#### Work, Travel, Learning and Self Improvement

- Hours worked: 0, same as last year.
    - This was my third hiatus year in a row! I am privileged that I can live this way, but I'm not sure how much longer it can last.
- Programming languages/frameworks learned: 0 (0 last year). :sadface:
- Duolingo streak: 1808 days (from 1448 last year). 
    - Once again, IDk how this math works, as 1808 - 1448 is only 360. And once again, I'm pretty sure I never broke the Duolingo streak this year, not even with a streak freeze! 
    - There was [a Duolingo year in review](/2023/12/111527017079592659/)!
- Other countries visited: 1
    - [I went to Singapore early in the year](/2023/03/sgtrip2023/), my first foreign travel since the pandemic

#### On this site

- 147 [blog posts](/blog/), 114,257 words worth; from 138 posts and 105,510 words last year. Below are some of the 2023 ones I really liked (that aren't weeknotes or reviews):
    - [Word Persons and Web Persons](/2022/11/word-web-persons/) (I believe this is my most commented on post of the year)
    - [You Can Write About Anything](/2023/06/write-anything/)
    - [On Social Media, Lurkers, Introverts, and Blogging](/2023/10/social-media-lurkers-introverts-blogging/)
    - [Growth and Techno-Optimism](/2023/10/growth/)
    - [Youtube vs Adblockers, Apps vs the Open Web](/2023/11/youtube-adblockers/)
    - [Old Folks and Tech](/2023/11/old-folks-and-tech/)
- 243 [notes](/notes/), from 325 last year
- 201 [links shared](/links/), from 202 last year
- 168 comments! Down from 402 last year.

Also, here's a wordcloud for 2023:

{{< img src="wordcloud2023.png" >}}

(Somehow these remain largely the same year after year?)

#### Elsewhere

- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/): 0 post/comments!
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/roytang/): 227 tweets (down from 773 last year). Unsurprising; because of Elon Musk cutting off API access and turning Twitter into a Nazi bar, I unceremoniously mostly stopped using Twitter around April. "Mostly" because I still have my account and check it sometimes to look at some things, join giveaways etc. I will no longer track this next year.
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/roytang0400/): 2 photos posted. Vs 41 last year. Has mostly become a read-only platform for me.
- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/hungryroy):
    - 7 submissions (3 last year)
    - 45 comments (73 last year)
    - There's a [Reddit Recap](/2023/12/reddit-recap/)!
- Full live stats for content on this site and social media activity available [here](/page/stats/live/).

#### Content creation

- I need a better term for this section than "content creation"
- [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy) streaming:
    - [Twitch Recap 2022](/2023/12/twitch-recap/)
    - streamed on 50 separate days, for a total streaming time of 127 hours, down slightly from 51 days/136 hours last year
    - currently at 39 followers, +4 from last year. The Twitch recap says I had 11 new followers, so there were some unfollows! HOW DARE YOU loljk
- [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@roytang):
    - 38 Youtube videos uploaded, down from 56 last year
    - I think I streamed less MTG this year which is why my output is much lower. 
- [Gamedev](/tags/gamedev):
    - I only made 1 game jam submission this year:
        - [Untitled Shooty Game 2](/2023/01/ludum-dare-52-shooty-2/)
    - I kind of fell out of love with the idea of doing game jams after this one. Will re-evaluate where I want to be gamedev-wise.
- Sketching:
    - Not a lot in [the sketchbook](/albums/sketchbook/) this year. I did [do Inktober again this year](/tags/inktober2023/) though!

#### Media consumption

- **Movies**. (New) movies watched: 50, down from 68 last year
    - [The list.](/lists/media/movies/2023/)
    - Watched 8 movies in the cinema this year and surprisingly only half of those were superhero ones. IDK if I will keep it up next year, I have kind of soured on the cinema experience due to price. Doesn't seem worth it (compared to just streaming) unless you're going out with friends
    - I managed to watch all but 4 of [the films on my 2023 checklist](/2023/01/2023-checklist/#movies) this year, though not all of them in the cinema. Two were delayed to 2024.
    - My favorite films I watched this year: 
        - [Good Will Hunting (1997)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#good-will-hunting-1997)
        - [Suzume (2022)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#suzume-2022)
        - [Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-2023)
        - [The Super Mario Bros Movie (2023)](/2023/04/movies-jan-apr-2023/#the-super-mario-bros-movie-2023): I have rewatched this so many times at home because the nephews love it
        - [Guardians of the Galaxy vol 3 (2023)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2024/#guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-2023)
        - [Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (2023)](/2023/08/movies-may-aug-2024/#spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-2023)
    - Something new this year: I made [a Letterboxd account](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/films/diary/)! All my 2023 watched movies are logged there, then synced back to this site.
- **Books** read: 8, down from last year's 19
    - [The list](/lists/media/books/2023/), with 6 fiction and 2 nonfiction.
    - This year's fiction reads were 67% Discworld (unsurprising, they are easy to read) and a couple of pleasant surprises: [Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow](/2023/05/tomorrow3/) was probably my favorite book of the year and [Gideon the Ninth](/2023/07/gideon-the-ninth/) was a pleasant sci-fi surprise. 
    - I picked up Tomorrow3 because it was on so many "best of 2022" lists, so I'm looking forward to what the best of 2023 lists give me!
    - Both of the nonfiction books I read this year were surprisingly about time. [Four Thousand Weeks](/2023/03/four-thousand-weeks/) was the better read for me.
    - Yet another step in my downtrend of books read. If there's one thing I learned from this year's nonfiction books though is that time is finite, and ultimately it's my choice to not have enough time to devote to reading, since I really enjoy other activities too (i.e. gaming). That doesn't stop me from enviously looking at the book lists of my friends who have read like 50+ books last year!
- **TV/Streaming**
    - [Here's the list](/lists/media/tv/2023/) of all the TV shows I've written about this year.
        - I wrote about 28 shows this year, down from 36 last year. A lot of them were very good!
    - Decided to stop logging my watch history counts this year, since that has always seemed a bit silly.
- **Comics**
    - I wrote about some comics this year: [the 2023 list](/lists/media/comics/2023/).
    - [The Complete Marvel Run](/tags/complete-marvel-run): Currently up to 10.24% as of [the last post](/2023/11/cmr-daredevil/).
    - I actually read a lot more comics than the above links imply, since I read more than I have time to write about. For Marvel, we will catch up eventually, I hope. For DC and others, I hope to write a bit more about them this year.
    - I must note that this year, I read the wonderful [It's Lonely st the Centre of the Earth](/2023/09/its-lonely/)
- **Music**
    - Music tracks played (Spotify/LastFM): 2029. (884 last year). See [listening stats here](/page/stats/listening/). 
    - [Here's my 2023 Spotify Wrapped](/2023/12/111509729930849977/).
    - This year's listening stats are a bit of an anomaly because for a good part of the year I had my Spotify account hooked up to the Amazon Echo in the living room which my mom basically uses as a radio, so it includes her track selections.
    - I also still listened to a lot of music via YT, which I have no way of tracking.

#### Gaming

- Games purchased (not including any I got for free for some reason): 5, way down from 27 last year.
    - Steam purchases: 
        - Street Fighter 6
        - Root Underworld expansion
        - Baldur's Gate 3
    - Nintendo Switch:
        - Tears of the Kingdom
        - Super Mario Wonder
    - Humble: I ended up just cancelling my Humble Choice sub completely
- My gaming spend is up significantly this year (more than 5x), since I bought a number of new games on release (see above)
- Games "finished" (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete OR played a bunch of multiplayer on): 11, down from 13 last year
    - [The list.](/lists/media/games/2023/)
        - By genre: 3 RPGs, 2 narrative games, 2 zeldas, 2 platformers, 1 metroidvanias, 1 vampire survivors
        - By platform: 1 on Steam, 2 on Switch, 8 on PC game pass, 0 on mobile, 0 on PS4
    - I think the lower completion count can be attributed to just the sheer length of RPGs I played this year, including 2 I didn't "finish".
- PC Game Pass: 
    - I really made the most of PC game pass this year, playing 10 games on the service and finishing 8!
    - [2023 Recap for PC Game Pass](/2023/12/111573059124863178/)
    - Total game pass playtime: 165h
    - Most played PC Game Pass games:
        - [Middle-Earth Shadow of War](/2023/08/shadow-of-war/): 47h
        - [Sea of Stars](/2023/12/sea-of-stars/): 45h
        - [Ori and the Will of the Wisps](/2023/02/ori2/): 21h
- Steam:
    - [Gaming/Steam stats page](/page/stats/gaming/)
    - [My Steam Year in Review 2023](/2023/12/111605796533635333/)
    - Steam playtime this year: 499.18 hours (way down from 850.62 last year!)
    - Most played Steam games for the year:
        - [Marvel SNAP](/2022/12/marvel-snap/) - 129.03h
        - [Gloomhaven](/2022/12/gloomhaven/) - 94.22h
        - [Baldur's Gate 3](/2023/12/bg3/) - 90.68h
        - The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - 78.82h: Was originally planning to play through the DLCs since I had never played them before, but ended up only having time for the main game before the deluge of excellent 2023 releases came in
        - [Eternal Card Game](/tags/eternalcardgame): 45.70h: Way down from 263.45h last year. The competitive scene has kind of dried up, so I don't have much motivation for this game.
        - Street Fighter VI - 36.80h: Was super excited for this release at the start of the year, but found the new systems challenging when it came out and couldn't get into it too much. It's Street Fighter, so I expect to give it another shot at some point
- Nintendo Switch:
    - Playtime this year: 221h, up from 186h last year.
    - Most played games:
        - [Tears of the Kingdom](/2023/07/totk/) - 169h
        - [Super Mario Bros Wonder](/2023/11/mario-wonder/) - 28h
        - Xenoblade Chronicles 3 - 13h: This was the least interesting of 3 RPGs I was trying to finish in the fourth quarter and will probably end up being a DNF
- CCGs
    - [Magic The Gathering](/tags/mtg/)
        - [My MTG Stats](/page/stats/mtg/)
        - This year I played in exactly two paper drafts with friends: once in January with Strixhaven and another in November with Lost Caverns of Ixalan. Other than that, no paper events.
        - [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena) did not give me any end of year stats this year.
            - However, I am happy to report that in 2023, [Wilds of Eldraine was my winningest Arena limited format of all time](/2023/10/mtgwoe-limited-recap/)!
            - In a moment of weakness, I spent $15 on Arena this year
            - In my 2023 checklist, one of my goals was "Cash out at an Arena or Eternal open". I have failed in this regard. I played in [9 Arena Opens](/page/stats/mtg/#arena-open-stats) in 2023 and didn't even make day 2!
    - [Marvel Snap](/tags/marvel-snap)
        - I [wrote about this game at the end of 2022](/2022/12/marvel-snap/), but I kept playing it throughout most of the year, both on Steam and mobile, despite it being a lot more challenging to get new cards once I was series 3 complete. Still, I somehow managed to get to infinite rank twice this year and I remain free-to-play
    - [Eternal](/tags/eternalcardgame)
        - Scaled back on this game a lot, as the competitive scene is all but dead (no opens!) and I mostly just play once a week to get some new promos
- I have stopped playing Words with Friends early in the year.
- Overall a much more exciting year in gaming than I expected. From [the 2023 checklist](/2023/01/2023-checklist/) I was really only expecting to play 2 new releases this year and was mostly planning on playing older games; Baldur's Gate 3 wasn't even on my radar, neither was Sea of Stars. Super Mario Wonder was a pleasant surprise towards year end.

#### Trivia Team

- In 2023, in-person [quiz nights](/tags/quiznight/) came back in full force! The trivia team attended 18 such quiz nights, placing third twice, second place six times, and winning six times, not bad! I kind of want to make a consolidated stats page for our quiz nights, but that might take a while to put together.
- NYT crosswords: As of today, we are at a 735-day streak for the NYT crossword (last year I reported a 370-day streak, so the math checks out!) We have been mostly doing the NYT puzzles as a group over Discord. 
    - In addition to the crosswords we have enjoyed the Spelling Bee and the Acrostics and we individually do the Connections daily as well.
    - I have however [stopped playing Wordle in April](/2022/04/final-wordles/) (this post has stats!). 
    - In March the NYT discontinuted the acrostics and removed them from the site, but I have put up an archive here: [NYT Acrostics Archive](/files/acrostics/)
    - Late in the year, we also got into [Cine2Nerdle](https://www.cinenerdle2.app/) which we enjoyed a lot, especially the brand-new battle mode!
- The Trivia Team has a YT channel, [@teamcamoteph](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph) where we upload recordings of the above shenanigans and other gaming and puzzle things. We uploaded 38 videos in 2023, down from 67 last year.

#### Food

- New section because I added [a food stats page](/page/stats/food/) this year!
- Donuts eaten: 7 donuts, up from 6 last year!
- Top fast food restaurants this year, by spend:
    - Pizza Hut (29 meals, P4,704.70)
    - Jollibee (24 meals, P3,985.00)
    - KFC (9 meals, P2,032.00)

#### Others

- Steps/Activity:
    - Fitbit: 2,158,167 steps, 1,683.32km, up almost 12% from last year, which is amazing considering [I stopped using my Fitbit in August](/2023/09/moving-on-fitbit/)!
    - Google Fit: 1,023,998 steps since mid-August. I switched to this app to track my steps after giving up on Fitbit.
    - Year total: 3,182,165 steps, or an average of 8.7k steps daily
        - Again an amazing total, considering last year's Fitbit total was already my record for most number of steps logged in a year. I started the year averaging 7.5k steps per day in January and was averaging 10k steps per day by May. I mostly held that up for the rest of the year except for a few weeks of unavoidable interruptions. (Hospital stay, covid bout, holiday rest.) 
        - Happily, I also saw my weight drop a bit this year, although I don't check it regularly, and I suspect I regained some of it again over the holidays.
- Baptisms attended: 0, from 1 last year
- Weddings attended: 0, from 1 last year
- Wakes attended: 0, though someone I knew passed away late in the year, I was unable to attend the wake.
- New pamangkins: 0
- Grab:
    - Trips: 18, up from 2 last year
        - Last year I said "Also, their prices have gotten way too high, so whenever I need to go anywhere by myself, I just take regular taxis as much as possible.", but sometimes regular taxis aren't an option, like when I need to go to/from the airport or have to go in the wee hours and time is critical. A number of the booked trips were also for the parents, as they had more social activities this year, and my dad doesn't like to drive to far or unfamiliar places.
    - Food delivery: 1, way down from 9 last year
        - Surprised I even had the 1 delivery! 
    - Express delivery: 1, down from 3 last year. Again, this was just to send out stuff to some family members.
- Bears defeated in single combat: 0
- Tips received via [my profile on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/roytang): 8. This is FOUR TIMES last year's total! I still find it odd to ask for donations, though I have posted a request on the triviastorm account a couple of times.

### The future

One last statistic: this year's yearnotes is about 30% longer than last year's. 

For me, the year in review post is about the past year. My next post will be my 2024 checklist, where I talk about the future and things I'm looking forward to in the coming year.
