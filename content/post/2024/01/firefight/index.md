title: 'Book Review: Firefight by Brandon Sanderson'

**Firefight** is book 2 in Sanderson's young adult *Reckoners* series. I [read the first book back in 2015](/2015/11/steelheart/). Sometime last year, I bought a physical copy of book 3 on sale and only got around to reading book 2 this month. The book is short! It only took me 3 sittings to finish over 2 days. Sometime in the middle of the 2nd sitting I inadvertently spoiled myself about this book's ending by looking up something from the first book, and also reading the blurb on the back of book 3.

Anyway, it's been a while since book 1, but I think the tone and writing of the book still mirrors that one pretty closely. The book is written from the protag's point of view, and he always speaks like a bit of a smartass teenager, which can get annoying. (To be fair, he is nineteen!) He continues to be bad at analogies.

> I hadn’t been a nerd, mind you. I’d just been the type of guy who spent a lot of time by himself, focused entirely on a single consuming interest.

> “Like, I can spot stupidity, because I know it so well. The way an exterminator knows bugs really well, and can spot where they’ve been? I’m like that. A stupidinator.” 

I did like how his being a nerd factored into him eventually figuring out what was going on and what the bad guys were up to and even possibly the secrets behind the whole Calamity thing. Although TBH I suspect for that last bit, Sanderson never really planned to expound on this series when writing the first book and just came up with this post hoc explanation later on.

Despite the kinda juvenile protag (unsurprising for a YA series I suppose), the plot is compelling and moves along quickly. It actually starts in the middle of the action, with the Reckoners fighting another epic. I mentioned in the first book that their operations feel like heist movies; this is still true but while reading this time the analogy that came to my mind was that of a puzzlebox. Each Epic was a puzzle they had to solve, as each one had a specific weakness, and they had to figure out how to exploit that and trap the Epic.

The book ends on a bit of a sour note for the Reckoners, a bit of Empire-Strikes-Back flavor I suppose. I am kind of looking forward to jumping into the third book already and seeing where they go from here!

*(Meta note: This is my fourth book for January, which is an insane pace for me since I basically only read only 8 books for the whole of last year!)*
