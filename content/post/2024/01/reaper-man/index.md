title: 'Books: Reaper Man by Terry Pratchett (Discworld #13)'
---

Finished reading *Reaper Man*, Discworld book #11. This book focuses on Death, the omnipresent character in all Discworld books, as he faces down his own mortality.

There is a Death plot and a secondary Ankh-Morpok plot in there, and I feel like Pratchett wrote the Death story first and found out it wasn't enough so he put together the secondary plot focused on the recently-deceased wizard Windle Poons. I certainly enjoyed the main plot more; Death's idyllic life as Bill Door on Miss Filtworth's farm reminded me a bit of Equalizer 3 which I watched recently: he just wanted to live this simple life, but trouble came calling anyway. The Ankh-Morpork half of the story seems so jumbled and chaotic by comparison, although some interesting characters were introduced in the Fresh Start club.

This brings us to [20/41 Discworld](/topics/discworld/) books read! Almost halfway through! Let's see how many I can get through this year.
