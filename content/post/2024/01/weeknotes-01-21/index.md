### The World

Apparrently there was a Coldplay concert in the country recently and the only reason I know about it is that our current President has been a bit criticized for attending the concert by taking a PSG helicopter to get there. I don't particularly care about that, but it's kinda weird because he would have been in his 40s when Coldplay broke out, and who attends a concert for a band they listened to in their 40s? My playlists are still mostly 90s and 2010s music!

The weather has been quite cold recently, in the evenings and early mornings at least. Enough that I will often just sleep without a fan on. Mid-days are still often quite hot. 

### My Week

I had another busy/exhausting week. A lot of medical-related errands  again, this time from Wednesday through Friday. The good news is that my efforts bore some fruit (not as much as we would have hoped), and we are now mostly prepped for the next infusion cycle, except for the prelim blood tests which we'll do later next week.

I might not have a lot to talk about this week.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Slowly making my way through **Persona 5 Tactica**.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.
    - Others: We are still playing way too much Cine2Nerdle battle. Videos are on [the Team Camote PH YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph/videos)!

- **Reading**: Currently on the 3rd volume of Doctor Strange, still kinda taking it slow; I am at less than a fourth ofthe run. Almost finished with the current Discworld book.

- **Watching**: Watched a bunch more action movies this week. Continued the Fast and Furious run covering movies 8 and 9, plus also watched the latest 2 Equalizer films. All my reviews are available on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/) and will be on the blog sooner or later. Finished watching Echo!

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,449 steps. It remains a struggle to maintain this pace.

I have had been nursing a cold for most of the week. I have now burned through one and a half *banigs* of Neozep Forte. Also experiencing a bit of dizziness / light-headedness here and there, not sure if caused by the colds or what.

I had managed to avoid eating chips/crisps since the start of the year, but then my dad plopped a can of pringles in my room (opened already) and I was like maybe I can hold off on this until like the end of the month? I devoured them all the next day. Oops.

Not on the linkblog: A couple of fun weeknotes formats: [Weeknotes 9 fun comic edition](https://anhvn.com/posts/2024/weeknotes-9/) by @latte@mastodon.online and [Jennifer Mills News](https://jennifermillsnews.tumblr.com/), where the weekly post are formatted as newspaper-style clippings (they're images, so they're not very accessible though). Maybe I'll try to experiment with my own weeknotes format at some point. Found via [LostFocus](https://lostfocus.de/2024/01/14/week-2-2024/).



### Site Changes

- My efforts at cleaning up/archiving old content continue, and I keep talking about writing it up, but the draft is still in my head and I keep adding to it so maybe I should start typing it out soon.
- Minor UI fixes

### Things I've been thinking about

Nostalgia, trawling through the past, things I don't want to do, old movies we watched in the cinema, the ability to intuit directions, old travels, being antisocial back in college, chilling

### Looking Forward To

Will be attending my first quiz night of the year this Wednesday, the final game of the current Geekfight league!
