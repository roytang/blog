### Set Notes

- The last set, [Wilds of Eldraine](/2023/10/mtgwoe-limited-recap/) was my winningest limited Arena set of all time. Perhaps ironically, it was followed by this set which is now my all-time worst limited performance for an Arena premier set. My winrate was just atrocious; while the decks I built felt good, I always felt a bit out of rhythm in the actual draft games and performance suffered a lot. I just couldn't figure it out! I am happy to move on.
- My best performing archetype was Rakdos, probably because it was straightforward aggro + removal.

### 7-x Sealed/Draft Decks

I never even trophied in this format! I have no decks to share.

### Arena Open attempts

My notes say I played a sealed open last Nov 25, but I don't seem to have saved the decklist, all I have is this screenshot of the rares I opened:

### Magic Arena Stats

LCI Arena Stats dropped on Feb 17.

### 2023 Stats

Since it's January, Arena also recently sent me my end of year stats for 2023:

{{% photos 2023stats %}}

Notably, these stats imply I played 33% less games in 2023 compared to 2022 for some reason?

### Paper Draft

Last Nov 18th I also managed to join some friends to open a box and play an 8-man paper draft, a rare foray back to actual tabletop Magic! We only played a 3-round Swiss, and it was a modified draft: we added one sealed pack to each deck. I believe I finished 2nd out of 8.

Wow, I was so bad at this set, I didn't even stream a lot! I only have two videos for LCI:

*Murders at Karlov Manor* comes out early next month! Doing so poorly at LCI kind of depleted my resources, so I have to save up again!
