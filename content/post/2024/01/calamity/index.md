title: 'Book Review: Calamity by Brandon Sanderson'

So just yesterday I wrote about how [I finished reading the previous book Firefight](/2024/01/firefight/) and that finishing 4 books in January was already an excellent pace for me. Well after writing that entry I unwrapped the next book Calamity and powered through it in less than 24 hours, so I guess I am now at 5 books for January!

I dove into the third book eagerly because I wanted to see how the Reckoners would deal with having to go against their own founder turned evil at the end of the previous book. This one starts out with the Reckoners seeking out new allies and resources before heading out to a new city (and a new set of dangerous Epics to deal with) to figure out how to take down Prof.

The protagonist continues to talk like an immature teenager, but he's had to grow up quickly as he assumes the burden of leadership. The first two books felt like a series of action/heist movies with the Reckoners planning complicated missions. Under David's leadership, everything feels a bit more seat-of-the-pants and they spend most of the book without really knowing how they're going to pull off the impossible goals set before them. 

The plot is still action-packed, but it feels like there's a lot more downtime here than in previous books, a lot more intel gathering etc, which all goes to waste when their plans inevitably go awry.

I was a bit surprised by the eventual reveal and resolution with the titular Calamity because all this time I was assuming this series was part of Sanderson's Cosmere and that Calamity would turn out to be related to one of the Shards of Adolnasium, but that turns out not to be the case. As it was, the ending felt like it came a bit abruptly and out of nowhere, but maybe that's just me.

I also didn't know this was the final book of the main story (there is a spin-off book that has only been released as an audiobook so far according to Wikipedia), it felt like there were some things left unresolved (like a certain Epic's threat and further details about Calamity's origin)

Overall I still enjoyed the series, despite the protagonist's idiosyncrasies. It's good to finally put it to bed.
