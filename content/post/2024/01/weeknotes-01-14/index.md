### My Week

I had an exhausting week. Medical-related errands occupied three of five weekdays; one of those was the first immunotherapy cycle which took us most of the day because of unforeseen problems, and then Thursday and Friday I had to do more follow-up work for further financial assistance, lots of bureaucracy to get through. Some relatives were also in town last weekend and we spent a good chunk of last Sunday entertaining.

On the blog: not much this week; wrote [the MTG LCI set recap](/2024/01/mtglci-set-recap/) and a book review.

Trivia team attended the penultimate game of the Geekfight league last Wednesday, I did not attend. Actually, neither did most of the regular members, as the topic wasn't something we were very familiar with, so we pulled in a bunch of "mercs" to help us. I had low expectations and basically would have been happy with the 1 league point for attendance, but surprisingly, they did really well and won the thing! I believe that means we can no longer lose first place in the league! The final game should be the week after this one.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Not a lot! A little bit of **Persona 5 Tactica** here and there.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.
    - Heh, gaming has been slow in 2024 so far.
    - Others: We are still playing too much Cine2Nerdle battle. Videos are on [the Team Camote PH YT channel](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph/videos)!

- **Reading**: Currently on the 3rd volume of Doctor Strange, still kinda taking it slow. Finished reading [This Is How You Lose the Time War](/2024/01/how-you-lose-the-time-war/)! Started reading another Discworld book!

- **Watching**: Continued my Fast and Furious run, powering through the increasingly ridiculous parts 5 through 7. I also watched Kung Fu Panda 3 this weekend. All my reviews are available on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/) and will be on the blog sooner or later. Still haven't started Echo!

### Walking

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 70,212 steps, so we are back to form. It's still kind of exhausting to be doing this every day, especially when I have a lot of other stuff going on.

OTOH, I found that I may have actually lost weight over the holidays!

### Site Changes

- Reworked the layout for listing screens, making them more compact. Still playing around with how to best to present this, especially for screens that list different types of posts.
- Turned off automatic import/syndication of letterboxd reviews, and deleted previously posted notes. I'm kind of trying to keep the notes total down, so I'm going to try doing monthly summaries of my watched movies instead.
- Related: Still going through and cleaning up/archiving old content as needed. I plan to write about this effort soonish/at some point.
- Minor UI fixes

### Things I've been thinking about

Rethinking the archives, backups, bureaucracy, scarcity, travel plans, the ability of anxiety to overcome dread, growing old and dealing with sickness, family ties

### Looking Forward To

Hm... nothing specific this coming week it seems. There are more follow-up errands to be done though!
