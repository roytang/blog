### The Book

First book read for the new year! I chose to start with an easy read to sort of ease into the new year. It's Spelunky by Derek Yu, which covers the story behind the indie platformer Spelunky from the early 2010s. The book is super short, clocking in at around 111 pages on the Kindle mobile app. I am unsure where I got this copy; probably from some bundle somewhere, I think I've had it for years.

The book is a straightforward read about the process of how Spelunky came about: I never knew it started as a freeware GameMaker platformer that was later adapted for XBLA before making it to Steam and PlayStation platforms (where I played it eventually). The author isn't primarily a programmer, he makes that clear, so his stories are mostly from the perspective of game design and art and the whole process of putting the game together and releasing it, but less on the technical/development side. 

He also details a number of the secrets that made it into the game, which was interesting for me since I never got too far with the game myself. I was kind of experiencing the game vicariously through this book!

Lots of lessons to learn from this one, especially for someone like me who is an aspiring hobbyist gamedev who wants to maybe break into the industry one day. One of the lessons I highlighted is how the author focuses on "finishing as a skill", something which I definitely lack (looks behind at the trail of half-finished projects). The stories also highlight all the challenges, delays, etc. 

Honestly it's a bit discouraging because I look at his life story and he's basically spent all his working life on gamedev and something like Spelunky still took like the better part of 5 years of his life. Whereas by comparison I am in this as a hobbyist only part of time and maybe even half-heartedly; it makes me appreciate the level of additional commitment I need to give to this if I really want it. 

A short read, but very interesting, especially for someone like me, living my gamedev life vicariously through reading books!

### The Game

While I'm here, might as well write a short review for Spelunky the game! I purchased this on sale on PS3 back in December 2013 and later also got it cross-play on PS4 and Vita via PS+. If you're unfamiliar, Spelunky is a procedurally-generated platformer, so each level is generated on the fly and different for each run.

Looking at the achievement list, I never got very far! It looks like I only got to the Jungle levels and never got to the Mines, so less than half of the available levels! I think I never really got into it because while it's fun and I do like platformers, it's the sort of game that requires a lot of repetition to develop mastery, and I didn't really have the patience for that at the time. If I had more time and didn't have a ton of other games I wanted to play I might have really gotten into it.

I do remember playing it a few times for Niece #1 while she was a little kid hanging out at home because she enjoyed watching me die!
