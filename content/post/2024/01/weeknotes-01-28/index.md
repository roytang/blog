### My Week

The weather has been so cold recently. Even midday with the sun bearing down, the wind is brisk and chilly. I have taken to wearing a jacket when going out walking, especially at night.

I had a bit of a more relaxing week this time. In fact, I suspect I slept too much during the first few days of the week, probably as an overreaction to how exhausting the past couple of weeks were. The free time mostly went to catching up with some reading, gaming, watching and some archival/cleanup work I've been putting off. 

Trivia team didn't do too well in the last Geekfight league game, but [we still won the league](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-league-final)!

On the blog: I wrote about [2000s manga](/2024/01/2000s-manga/), and also [a book review](/2024/01/reaper-man/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still slowly making my way through **Persona 5 Tactica**. I've finished only one "Kingdom" so far, and I suspect there are 4 of them, so I guess I am 25% through? Also close to finishing **Super Mario Land 2** which [I streamed a while back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fY5OO6Hm0Hc) and have just been playing offline every now and then.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**.
    - Others: We are still playing way too much Cine2Nerdle battle. 

- **Reading**: Currently on the 3rd volume of Doctor Strange, less than halfway through. Finished Reaper Man (Discworld), review is linked above. Started a Sanderson book!

- **Watching**: Continuing my action movie trend, this past week I watched Fast X, Star Trek Beyond and Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. All my reviews are available on [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/) and will be on the blog sooner or later. 

### Walking and Health

This past week (Sunday through Saturday) Google Fit says I walked a total of 65,236 steps. First week that we missed the weekly quota this year! I was experiencing stomach pains Friday through Saturday and while I slogged through it on Friday and still did my walks, I decided to forgive myself Saturday. Surely I am allowed to take a rest once a month!

My colds have continued this week as well, though it is almost gone today. So many neozeps.

    > "This is one of my answers to the question of, why give a fuck about work? Why love your work? It won’t, of course, love you back. It can’t. Work isn’t a thing that can love. It isn’t alive, it isn’t and won’t ever be living. And my answer is: don’t. Don’t give a fuck about your work. Give all your fucks to the living."

### Site Changes

- My efforts at cleaning up/archiving old content continue.
- Minor UI fixes

### Things I've been thinking about

Health concerns, dizziness, missed opportunities, nostalgia, what might have been, the world being terrible, piracy, AI, spam, AN AXE, cutting down (on consumption), how to be more productive

### Looking Forward To

More medical errands this week, it's the second infusion cycle. 

Royal Rumble is airing today! Not sure when I can watch.

End of month stuff. Some family birthdays, but it sounds like we won't be able to get together this coming weekend.
