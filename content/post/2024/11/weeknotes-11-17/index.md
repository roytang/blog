Today's entry will be a bit short. I'm writing this ahead of time so hopefully my scheduled publishing works fine.

### The World

I am trying not to pay too much attention to US-centric news following their elections, but one can't help but hear about how ridiculous the cabinet picks coming out of the incoming administration are.

BlueSky is experiencing a surge of sign-ups following the US elections. I have enabled the bridge from Mastodon, so if you are on BlueSky, you can follow my Masto profile [here](https://bsky.app/profile/roytang.indieweb.social.ap.brid.gy).

### My Week

I am traveling for 2 weeks starting today. As such, I spent most of this week doing a bunch of errands in advance to make sure everything is taken care of while I am away and that the patient has all her meds already until I get back. There will be an immunotherapy session while I am away, so I have arranged for someone else to cover for me this once. Also spent a bunch of time making sure I don't fall too far behind on my TV shows while I am away!

On the blog: I wrote [a new comics post about X-Factor v1](/2024/11/cmr-xfactor-v1/), [a Zelda review](/2024/11/echoes-of-wisdom/), and [a set recap for Duskmourn](/2024/11/duskmourn/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finished playing **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** this week! Also been playing some single-player **Eternal Card Game**, mostly just achievement hunting.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, a bit of **Street Fighter VI**. 
  
- **Reading**: Still a lot of comics! (At least I finished X-Factor v1 already!)

- **Watching**: Still just a lot of TV to keep up with: **Abbott Elementary**, **Star Trek: Lower Decks**, **Dandadan**, **Dragonball Daima**, **Ranma 1/2**, **Superman & Lois**, lots of **Boston Legal**. 

### Walking and Health

From Nov 10 (Sunday) to Nov 16 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 70,487 steps. Nice, managed to hit the target right before my trip! I am hoping I can get a whole bunch of steps in and even exceed the target during the trip!

### Some Links of Interest

I don't have any new links to share today.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

Probably not much blogging while I'm traveling, but we'll see what I can manage.
