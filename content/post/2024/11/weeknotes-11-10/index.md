### The World

The USA has once again failed an IQ test. Donald Trump will be their next president. The world braces for things to come.

### My Week

We had another immunotherapy session early in the week, it went well. Just a few more sessions to go! Also had my own regularly scheduled checkup this week (was mostly fine), and had to run some errands and get some things done before my travels later in the month.

We managed to [attend a Disney-themed quiz night this week](/2024/11/popquiz-disney/), but didn't do well.

On the blog: I wrote about [a well-known PH comic strip](/2024/11/pugad-baboy/), [my reactions to the world news](/2024/11/the-world-turns/) and [a review of a game I've just finished](/2024/11/starfield/).

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Finished playing **Starfield** and wrote my review this week. Hopefully can finish **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** this week! Also been playing random fighting games offline since finishing Starfield. I love fighting games (even though I am terrible at them.)
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, a bit of **Street Fighter VI**. 
  
- **Reading**: Still a lot of comics!

- **Watching**: Still just a lot of TV to keep up with: **Abbott Elementary**, **Star Trek: Lower Decks**, **Dandadan**, **Dragonball Daima**, **Ranma 1/2**, **Superman & Lois**, lots of **Boston Legal**. 

### Some Words I've Learned

Friends and I still regularly do the NYT Spelling Bee (though I've stopped playing Connections and Wordle recently [due to the strike](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/11/04/business/media/new-york-times-strike.html)). When we play, we always learn new words or remember old words we'd already forgotten because of how rare they are. Someone I follow sometimes has a "words I've learned" section in their weeknotes so I thought I'd add something similar to help me recall these words I've learned from Spelling Bee. (I just retrieve them from my browser search history!)

- GAVAGE: Force-feeding
- POMPANO: A type of fish
- ENDIVE: Leafy vegetable
- DIVAN: A kind of sofa
- TOMFOOL: I didn't think TOMFOOLERY had a root word!
- VIAND: A food dish. I'm only adding this here to note that for some reason the NYT Spelling Bee doesn't recognize this perfectly cromulent English word! ([Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/viand))
- EMETIC: Causing vomiting
- OROTUND: (Not to be confused with ROTUND) Pompous and bomastic

### Walking and Health

From Nov 03 (Sunday) to Nov 09 (Saturday), Google Fit says I only walked 60,101 steps. No rains to blame this time, I was mostly just a bit busy/lazy on Friday and Saturday.

### Some Links of Interest

- [The End Of Independent Publishing And Giant Freakin Robot | GIANT FREAKIN ROBOT](https://www.giantfreakinrobot.com/ent/independent-ends.html)

    A lot of detail here on how Google just doesn't care what happens to independent publishers.

    > "I went to Google directly, on their behalf, and told them about the problem. The message I walked away with, was that they do not care. Our industry is done. Future entertainment news and opinion will come from AI recaps scraped and stolen from our archived content or from the big media companies backed by hedge funds that Google has chosen as its designated survivors."

- [revealing the fediverse's gifts](https://www.wrecka.ge/revealing-the-gifts/)

    > "How much of everything discussed above is intelligible to potential new fediverse members? I would argue that the answer is “just about none of it.” Unless you have friends already on the fediverse to advise you, it’s almost impossible to tell what really matters in server choice, let alone how to determine which servers provide what kinds of governance."

- [Daring Fireball: Kottke on the Art and Power of Hypertextual Writing](https://daringfireball.net/2024/11/kottke_on_the_art_and_power_of_hypertextual_writing)

    > "What hypertext links provide is an extra layer of depth. Just the fact that the links are there — even if you, the reader, don’t follow them — makes a sentence read slightly differently. It adds meaning in a way that is unique to the web as a medium for prose."

- [Platform Strategy and Its Discontents - Infrequently Noted](https://infrequently.org/2024/10/platforms-are-competitions/)

    On how the JS-centric tech stacks and their terrible mobile performance might doom the web:

    > "So if the web is meeting all these requirements on desktop – even running away with the lead – why am I saying "the web is losing"? Because more than 75% of new devices that can run full browsers are phones. And the web is getting destroyed on mobile."

    ...

    > "When browser competition is finally unlocked, and when web pages aren't bloated with half a megabyte of JavaScript (on average), we can expect a revolution."

    ... This depresses me

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

I believe new set Foundations drops on Arena this week.

Starting next Sunday, I am traveling and will be away from home for 2 weeks so this week I have to spend time not only packing but also doing some errands earlier than I would have done them normally and hopefully I can finish everything on time.
