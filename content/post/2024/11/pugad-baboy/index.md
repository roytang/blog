title: 'PH Comic Strips: Pugad Baboy'
---

*Pugad Baboy* was a comic strip that started running in the *Philippine Daily Inquirer* in 1988 when former Overseas Filipino Worker Pol Medina Jr came back to the country in the aftermath of the EDSA revolution. ([Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugad_Baboy))

Pugad Baboy was a big part of my formative years - I was often reading the comics pages even as a young boy and as I was growing up we would regularly buy the compilation books that came out. My dad recently dug up some of the books that he had managed to preserve:

This is... not a lot, considering I am pretty sure we had copies of each of the first 10 books (only #4 remains here) and most likely all of the first 20 as well. Most of them probably did not survive when we moved house in 2000, which saddens me. I think #22, the most recent one of these, is from 2010.

Most of my favorite Pugad Baboy strips are the one-offs that involve puns or nonsense reactions. This entire post is admittedly just an excuse to post some of my favorite ones:

The following is one of my favorite nonsensical laugh-out-loud ones that me and some of my friends cite a lot. (I could not find a clean digital copy/scan of this one, feel free to send me one. It is from Pugad Baboy 11.)

Pugad Baboy is also known for it's longer story arcs (these are hit or miss for me) and also for being one of the comic strips that are unafraid to comment on PH politics and current events:

I once [commented](https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang/posts/10155112098678912) that I suspect this one about Marcos to be his most famous strip, as I had shared it before and during the 2016 elections:

In 2013, the *Inquirer* ["suspended" the strip because of a controversial strip about homosexuality in Catholic schools](https://www.philstar.com/campus/2013/06/06/950822/pdi-cancels-comic-strip-implying-pretty-students-girls-school-are-lesbians). In response, the author sent and posted [a terse resignation letter](https://www.instagram.com/p/aSyGxQkzMO/). After that I think it became web-only for a while via Rappler.com.

He was unafraid to do puns based on regional accents and reference current pop culture:

Pugad Baboy was a big part of the zeitgeist in its heyday, even spawning a short-lived TV series, but I guess it is way past its heyday. Nowadays I'm not sure if many of the younger generation are even still aware of it. It doesn't seem to be published in any of the major newspapers any longer - Wikipedia says it was last published in the Philippine Star in 2019. The author is [still active and occasionally posting new comics on Twitter](https://twitter.com/PolMedinaJr) though, and he seems to be actively supporting the industry, attending conventions and even publishing crossovers with newer strips by younger cartoonists.
