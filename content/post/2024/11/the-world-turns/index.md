Donald Trump has once again been elected president of the United States of America. The Onion hits the nail on the head:

The mood on my feeds (mostly just Mastodon and private chat groups) has been quite somber and depressed. A lot of hindsight and Monday morning quarterbacking and debating the hows and whys of the loss. It all reminds me of the mood right after Leni Robredo lost our own presidential elections back in 2022. Trump's comeback feels comparable in absurdity to the Marcos' family's rehabilitation through Jr's election as president.

I [wrote about my thoughts back then](/2022/05/post-election-thoughts/) and that saves me some time because many of the same thoughts come back to me now: disappointment, denial, disinformation, cultural biases, and dealing with your fellow citizens.

I still place heavy blame on technology's role in facilitating propaganda and misinformation. In my mind, no one in their right mind would choose Trump - a convicted felon, a serial rapist, a habitual liar, a doddering old man, and so on - over any other candidate no matter how bad the incumbent administration would have been. But I suspect that because it is difficult to confirm facts in our modern information environment, many voters either were ignorant of those faults or minimized them as the ramblings of a bitter opposition. In its infancy I was optimistic about the internet democratizing access to information and hoped that it would lead to a more enlightened society, but that presupposes a population inclined towards processing multiple points of view and rising above biases to discern truth. In actuality that turned out to be too much hard work and instead most people ended up relying on algorithms to funnel them into opinion bubbles which only served to increase divisions and acrimony. A literal playground for propagandists and conspiracy theorists and marketers. Related: [post-truth](/2019/03/10157302462348912/).

I wish I didn't have to pay so close attention to US politics, but as I've said many times, our declining superpower casts a long shadow over the rest of the world. Trump's comeback would have disastrous consequences at the very least in terms of climate change. Ukraine will soon lose access to aid and perhaps be forced to cede territory to Russia. And my own country might find the US a less reliable ally in the face of possible future Chinese aggression. Certainly European countries will be forced to find a way to be less dependent on their American cousins.

I suppose it lends more credence to the perils of centralization - before this past decade's wave of right-wing shifting, the world looked to the US hegemony for leadership in many things like peacekeeping, human rights, technology/internet, and so on. And now we are dealing with the consequences of dealing with an irrational partner that can change policy on a dime. Not unlike an internet platform that suddently changes the terms of service on us. The USA is weakened and a multipolar world awaits us, as Putin and Xi Jinping would have wanted.

The world turns, and we turn with it. Hopefully we can eventually find a way to deal with this rising tide.
