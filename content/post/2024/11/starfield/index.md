*Starfield* isn't a bad game per se; but there are a lot of missed opportunities, mostly because Bethesda was far too ambitious with what they wanted to accomplish with this game. I did play it for 80 hours and even enjoyed most of them but there are just many parts of the game that are unquestioningly bland and could have gone better.

In general I enjoyed the first 10-20 hours of the game more than the rest of it. I find that I enjoy the idea of being bombarded with a lot of different quests to do and Starfield certainly has no shortage there.

The main quest storyline is okay, but the problem is that the questline is something like 70% fetch quests that mostly don't even require NPC interaction or anything like that. I spent my early hours playing through the faction questlines, and each one of them was much more interesting than the main quest itself.

Exploration is kinda bleah, especially interstellar travel. Because of the vastness of space, you can't really do the Fallout/Skyrim thing of "Oh, I'll just walk in this direction and see what I find", so all interstellar travel is point-to-point and takes *almost zero* in-game time, WTH. I appreciate fast travel, but I still expect time to pass. Even if grav-drives magically transport you across the galaxy instantly, but you still need time to board the ship and launch etc.

Surface travel is not much better; when you visit a new planet, all story-relevant "points of interest" are already highlighted on the planet map. There are procedurally-generated points of interested like abandoned outposts filled with space bandits or abandoned mines or small colony outputs where they just ignore you when you wander in, but those are very uninteresting in general and not particularly rewarding, and I've seen Reddit posts complaining about how repetitive they are.

Mild annoyance: this might be a weird complaint. There is a large number of items in the game. That part is fine, even though many of the items are just "junk" items not really worth picking up. What annoys me is that it's very inconsistent; you walk into a room and see a desk and there's a bunch of different things on it and maybe only 50% of them can be picked up or interacted with. The rest are just static things that are there; they don't get blown away by explosions or antigravity or whatever. Why?!? Having so many junk items could be justified if everything was interactable, but for some things to be and some not to be, why bother?!? It's not just inventory items either. When walking around a base, there are tons of computer terminals and panels and whatnot; some are interactable, many are not. When surveying a planet, some plants can be scanned, many cannot. Ugh.

Mild annoyance: If they're going to give you so much stuff to pick up and sell, at least give the vendors more money to buy them with so that I'm not always overencumbered!

Large annoyance: While playing the early game, I was really looking forward to buying a new ship! And once I finally got one, I was underwhelmed. It was because I expected I would be able to do something with my old ship. Maybe send it on transport runs or assign a pilot and have it fight beside me in space battles or something like that. But no, it just sits somewhere in my magical ship inventory and I can only use one ship at a time and IDK where the others are when I'm not using them.

The only "story companions" you can recruit are all from the "main quest" faction and even though they have different back stories and companion quests, they feel largely interchangeable with similar personalities and they will usually like/dislike the same set of actions. There are other companions that you can recruit to help crew your ship or man your outposts, but they aren't particularly story-relevant or even romanceable.

There's just a lot of extraneous stuff. Outpost-building comes back from Fallout 4, and I hated it there too. I built a couple of outposts in the game, but could not be bothered with developing them too much. I'm here to play an RPG, not sim city. There's crafting and cooking and weapon mods, but you have to spend precious skill points to get anywhere with those, so it didn't really seem worth it. You can explore and survey planets (even ones that are already inhabited and have major cities WTH), but it becomes boring quickly.

Things I did like:

- The Kid Stuff trait, which gives you a Mom and Dad that you can visit in the game. I just like the flavor of this overall and they even give you free stuff! Sadly, they don't have as many interactions as I would have wanted.
- All of the different food items and background posters (if you look in the screenshot gallery below I took some pictures of them). It just amused me. (The food is largely useless for healing though, unless you enable an option to require occasional eating and drinking which I eventually did to improve my immersion.)
- Space battles were fine and definitely the most challenging part of the game; you can't avoid putting points into piloting so you can get better ships to make them easier.
- There is an interesting plot twist and difficult decision you have to make about halfway through the main quest.
- When you finish the game, you are actually given an interesting "New Game+" version that makes sense story-wise and might make the second run more interesting (IDK, I didn't bother with the second run. Yet.)

The game gives me the feeling of having been built by many subteams who didn't really talk to each other resulting in not a lot of interaction across systems. Like: the Kid Stuff trait gives you parents, but when you marry a companion (you can do that), you don't get the option to invite them to the wedding or anything. And when you marry a companion, none of the other companions seem to acknowledge or recognize that in any way! Some NPCs will comment on your actions like they heard it through the news, but when you're undercover with a shady group, they have no idea!

For me, [Skyrim](/2018/11/late-game-review-the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/) remains the pinnacle of this type of Bethesda RPG; the kind of game that lasts for a long time and you can play for years. I think for Starfield they were shooting for something similar or perhaps even more ambitious, but a lot of the systems like the procedural generation feel half-assed so there are a lot of missed opportunities. They might have been better served by scaling down a bit and reducing some systems to make what remains really tight, but that's not the universe we live in. 

I might keep playing or maybe revisit the game at some point in the future, see what improvements they make, but I'm not super optimistic. They recently released their first expansion DLC and it has not been reviewed well either.
