I finished **The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** last night. 

A cute little Zelda game notable (to me at least) for 2 reasons: (a) the lead character is Zelda, traditionally a supporting character to Link, who in an interesting reversal actually spends most of this game needing rescuing himself; and (b) it reuses the engine and many of the graphics from the [2020 Link's Awakening remake](/2020/10/1322214646221205504/) and layered on some more complicated exploration/platforming and some gameplay systems perhaps inspired a little bit by [Breath of the Wild](/2017/12/BdUzGKaAcpP/) / [Tears of the Kingdom](/2023/07/totk/). 

I liked the whole capturing and summoning echoes system, and a friend called it "one of the best pokemon games ever". My favorite thing is that Zelda can summon a bed on command to take a nap! Also, summoning a Lynel to beat up on low-level enemies is big fun after they beat me up a lot in BotW/TotK!

Completion was a challenge; I spent the last couple of weeks on-and-off scouring the map for things I missed. I eventually just googled the last four pieces of heart and gave up on gathering all the might crystals so I could finish the game already.
