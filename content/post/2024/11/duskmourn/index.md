### Set Notes

- I keep thinking the set name is spelled "Duskmourne" with the extra e for some reason.
- My string of mediocre limited performance during the play booster era continues. I was actually at a pretty decent 57% until I decided to do a few more quick drafts when they came back a couple of weeks ago; those drafts went terribly and tanked my winrate down 4 percentage points!
- The flavor was meh for me; I'm not a fan of horror personally. But I appreciate the contrast with the cute woodland creatures of the immediately preceding set.
- I did enjoy the draft format very much. Mechanically it's great; I love the implementation of manifest dread and survivors but I especially love the rooms mechanic and how it interacts with eerie; enough that I was probably drafting them a bit too highly and tried to force them too often.
- My favorite card in this set is the Skullcrab (shown at the top of the post).
- White was easily the best color in this format, and red was my personal worst.

### 7-x Draft Decks

I got my two trophy drafts early during the first quick draft run. Further drafts got close, but never enough.

### Streaming videos

Only managed to stream drafts a couple of times. [Here's the playlist on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXiNgXNZWWEKAwRdouHAbtna).

### Next

Foundations just dropped, and my first couple of drafts did not go too well. But I am also traveling over the next 2 weeks, so I may not be able to draft too much.

### Notes on Recent MTG News

I don't really care about Universes Beyond becoming Standard legal (looking forward to FF and Spider-Man TBH), but my main issue with the current 2025 release plan is the 6 standard sets for the year. That's one new set every 2 months! I'll have less time to draft each set and even these set recaps will need to come more quickly!
