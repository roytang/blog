When this post is published, I should have been traveling with friends in Japan for just under a week. Hanging out with friends is always awesome, but the whole traveling and waiting around at airports and packing all your things and lugging bags around and managing inventory is not. 

It is also exhausting. I don't have my weekly step total yet (as I am writing this before my week ends), but it's going to be a 90,000+ step week, with Saturday possibly being my record for day with the most step counts this year, with at least 21k steps! 

We were in Japan around the same time 9 years ago as well, but this trip feels much colder than that time.

Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of other things or links to share to post about this week. I will write about the trip in a future post. 

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

I should be back home right before next Sunday, so next week's post should be a full one again!
