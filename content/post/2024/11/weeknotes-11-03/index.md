Wow, a whole new month! The end of the year continues to relentlessly stalk us.

### My Week

We were told there would be another possibly strong typhoon coming in this week after Kristine shook us all last week, but it ended up staying mostly in the north and Metro Manila was hardly affected.

My errands this week were mostly just prep for the next immunotherapy session. This past weekend was also *Undas* (All Souls + All Saints Day), the traditional period over here of visiting with loved ones who had passed away. We managed to go visit an uncle who passed away more than 20 years ago.

A friend's mom passed away late last week and we went ahead and we attended the wake last Tuesday. She was 90 years old, which is good old age to live to.

Got the news last week that Mastodon server [botsin.space](https://botsin.space) is shutting down, sadly. This is where [my triviabot](https://botsin.space/@triviastorm) is currently running. The server goes read-only on Dec 15th, but I might not be able to have time to look for a new host before then, so probably the bot will be gone for a while and I'll just bring it back up on a different server sometime early in 2025.

We managed to [attend a quiz night this week](/collections/quiznights/popquiz-halloween), but didn't do well.

On the blog: Nothing much this week, other than the weeknotes. Hoping to get some other posts in this week.

### Media Diet

- **Gaming**: 
    - Single player: Still playing **Starfield** and **Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom** and hoping to finish and review both games by mid-November. I am not too happy with my current pace though.
    - Online: Still doing regular grinding in **Magic Arena** and **Marvel Snap**, a bit of **Street Fighter VI**. I have managed to tank my Duskmourn draft win rate.
  
- **Reading**: Mostly just more comics. I might be able to manage a long-overdue comics-related post this week.

- **Watching**: Still mostly watching just TV shows and no new movies this week. **Agatha All Along** and **Only Murders in the Building** seasons are done! Started watching the new season of **Abbott Elementary** and was pleasantly surprised to find that all 5 seasons of **Boston Legal** are on Disney+. Still trying to keep up with: **Star Trek: Lower Decks**, **Dandadan**, **Dragonball Daima**, **Ranma 1/2**, **Superman & Lois**. 

### Walking and Health

From Oct 28 (Sunday) to Nov 02 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 65,083 steps. A bit below the target due to Saturday laziness as usual, but still a big improvement over the rainy week prior.

### Some Links of Interest

- [How Google is Killing Bloggers and Small Publishers â€“ And Why](https://www.justapack.com/how-google-is-killing-bloggers-and-small-publishers-and-why/)

    I never liked the idea of SEO. Even in it's infancy I always felt like it was sleazy marketing voodoo. And the worst part was that all of it was completely dependent on a platform that could change things on a whim.

    > "If I wanted people to find our article on Prague in a Google search I had to call it something Google understood. And then I had to repeat what the article was about in the first 100 words. And then do it again and again in the content. It led to some less than stellar paragraphs occasionally, but I lived with it."

    At some point I did consider trying to earn money from blogging via ads, but that tendency quickly faded away when I realized I did not have the required focus or inclination to compromise my random ramblings enough to please the SEO gods. (Note: I am not suggesting I have ever written anything remotely close to a "stellar paragraph".

- [NearbyWiki: Wikipedia places nearby](https://en.nearbywiki.org)

    This seems fairly neat: A tool to explore nearby places that have Wikipedia articles.

- [We're forking Flutter. This is why.](https://flutterfoundation.dev/blog/posts/we-are-forking-flutter-this-is-why/)

    Flutter getting a fork because Google isn't devoting enough resources to it, which sounds like vintage Google. I tried Flutter a while back and found it an overall better experience compared to things like React Native or whatever, so this sounds like overall a good idea.

- [A vote for Donald Trump is a vote for school shootings and measles - The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/24282022/kamala-harris-endorsement-presidential-election-2024)

    > "He is unable to imagine a world where people cooperate for any reason other than the threat of violence, and so violence has become an inextricable part of his movement."

    I generally don't like to post too much about US politics for my own sanity (despite its outsized shadow on the rest of us), but I really like the framing here of how the MAGA crowd is unable to comprehend the concept of needing collective action to solve certain problems. (Problems which can also affect the rest of us!)

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

The highlight of this coming week is of course, the US elections happening on Tuesday. Like the rest of the world, I remain in suspense as to whether the Americans will actually pass this very simple IQ test or not.

Yet another immunotherapy session this coming week.

We are also planning to attend another quiz night this week.
