Today is the fourth Sunday of Advent, and this is the final weeknotes before Christmas.

### My Recent LSS/Earworm

Jose Mari Chan - A Perfect Christmas

### The World

- The USA once again narrowly averted a government shutdown after Shadow President Elon Musk derailed a planned bipartisan budget bill. A shutdown would have been pretty bad, but I have to admit to looking forward to a bit of *schadenfreude* if Musk and Trump got blamed over it.

### My Week

The past week was a bit less stressful, even though we are in a bit of a holding pattern as we are awaiting some test results. The first patient's penultimate immunotherapy session was last Tuesday, and I got a lot of walking down while waiting around. After talking with the doctor for a bit, I am reminded that even after this treatment is done, there is still a long road ahead (though hopefully much less resource-intensive!) and now we even have an additional patient to consider.

Previously I had sat down and listed a bunch of movies/shows/games/other things I wanted to finish before the year ends and the list was kind of long and it gave me a bit of stress wondering how I would get all of these things done. Then I remembered that I always used to say that [Jan 1 is just an arbitrary transition date](/2023/12/nye-jokes/#jan-1-is-an-arbitrary-date), so this trying to do so many things before NY didn't make any sense and I just chucked most of the list to next year. This is why my backlogs keep growing!

Happy to report that we have a replacement microwave now. I also got a new gaming chair from my brother! Sadly, [last year's gaming chair](/2023/12/111647299570441458/) didn't last a year. This one is a bit better quality so hopefully it lasts longer!

### Media Diet

- Reading: Still very early into **Wind and Truth**; my reading pace is not as good as I had hoped and this is one of the things I am likely to finish next year. I am on track with my ["complete Marvel run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run/) reading though and will be able to do another post before EOY.

- Watching: **Star Trek Lower Decks** series finale was great. All the anime are still ongoing: Dragon Ball Daima, Ranma 1/2, Dan Da Dan. Not sure if I will have time to squeeze in another TV series or maybe some movies before the year ends.

- Playing: 
    - I believe I am at least halfway through **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** (fantastic game) and there is a good chance I can finish and review it before EOY. Also still playing **Final Fantasy X-2** but the pace is not as good.
    - I still have **Marvel Rivals** installed but haven't played it much. Regular grinding: **Magic Arena**, **Marvel Snap**. I wish I also had time for fighting games, but alas.

### Walking and Health

From Dec 15 (Sunday) to Dec 21 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 44,111 steps. Even with the relaxed pace, we have already broken last year's step total. That means every walk/step from now until EOY is a bonus that makes next year's goals that much harder. Such are the perils of a "line must go up" attitude!

### Some Links of Interest

A good crop of links this week!

- [Superman | Official Teaser Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhUht6vAsMY)

    ngl, I am really hyped for this one.

- [Is HTML A Programming Language? (Webbed Briefs)](https://briefs.video/videos/is-html-a-programming-language/)

    Short answer: Yes.

    (It's a video, but there is a transcript)

- [Ed Yong, Journalist/Author - XOXO Festival (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ddy5uMdzZB8)

    (Youtube) Great talk from Ed Yong about his experience reporting during the pandemic

- [The Dark Side Of AI: Tracking The Decline Of Human Cognitive Skills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/chriswestfall/2024/12/18/the-dark-side-of-ai-tracking-the-decline-of-human-cognitive-skills/)

    > "Unlike earlier tools such as calculators and spreadsheets, which made specific tasks easier without fundamentally altering our ability to think, AI is reshaping the way we process information and make decisions, often diminishing our reliance on our own cognitive abilities."

    ...

    > "A 2023 study ... found that students who relied heavily on AI for writing assignments performed worse on tests that required independent thought and reasoning compared to students who completed assignments without AI assistance."

    Note: "The" in the headline implies this is the ONLY dark side of AI, which is far from the truth. "Making us dumber" is pretty bad, but still not as bad as "burning down the planet"

- [The "baseline" scene was actually written by Ryan Gosling](https://cohost.org/mcc/post/178201-the-baseline-scene)

    Some interesting details about Blade Runner 2049

- [Adactio: Articles—Of Time And The Web](https://adactio.com/articles/20638)

    Jeremy Keith on the passage of time and changes to the web (from a year ago!)

- [Digital curator Giulia Carla Rossi: ‘There is a misconception that if something is on the internet it will last for ever’ | Digital media | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2023/nov/18/giulia-carla-rossi-british-library-digital-curator-preserving-internet-publications)

- [Java in the Small - Cay Horstmann's Unblog](https://horstmann.com/unblog/2024-12-11/index.html)

    It's been almost a decade since I last worked with a big java project, so these are all new to me, and some of them seem neat. Not enough to entice me to use Java for my own scripting mind you!

    (Not sure the disparaging comparisons to python were necessary though!)

- [Always Go To The Funeral : NPR](https://www.npr.org/2005/08/08/4785079/always-go-to-the-funeral)

    > '"Always go to the funeral" means that I have to do the right thing when I really, really don't feel like it. I have to remind myself of it when I could make some small gesture, but I don't really have to and I definitely don't want to. I'm talking about those things that represent only inconvenience to me, but the world to the other guy. You know, the painfully under-attended birthday party. The hospital visit during happy hour. The Shiva call for one of my ex's uncles.'

    When I was recovering from burnout, I promised myself that moving forward I would only do things that I would stop being pressured into doing things and only do things that I want to do (this has not been an easy promise to keep). One exception quickly emerged: if a friend or family member needs me to be there for them (to attend a wedding or a funeral or to visit at the hospital or some other ceremony I typically dislike), I will try to do it because I want to be there for them.

    > "Do not be tricked into thinking that the Internet has one specific viewpoint."

    ...

    > "If I may coin a phrase, I will refer to these as “Diffuse, Amorphous, Nebulous, Generalized Internet Takes”, or DANGITs, which handily evokes the frustrating feeling of arguing against them."

My feed reader backlog is still pretty large, but I am chipping away at it slowly. Currently just below 400 items.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

Christmas is on Wednesday obviously. We always have family gatherings on the 24th and 25th so this year will be no different, though perhaps a bit bittersweet. It's always good to see the extended family though.

We are expecting some test results to come in either tomorrow or the day after Christmas, which should inform us how to move forward.
