### My Week

Following a 2-week sojourn with friends across Japan, I am happily back in my safe space: at home on my desktop, blogging. The trip was fun and we spent a lot of the time just being dumb or silly and there were even some physical challenges along the way. I had a great time, but am happy to be back home. Hopefully I can figure out soon how I want to present the blog post about this trip!

I arrived back home last night and honestly most of the time since then has been spent catching up on logging trip details, errands and other backlogs that have accumulated during my time away. It was kind of nice to come back to a room that had been untouched for 2 weeks!

Second week's step total was slightly less than the first week, clocking in at a mere 87.5k steps compared to the prior week's 90k+ steps. Lots of walking, very exhausting. I will probably take it easy on the steps the first few days back. I am still in a good position to beat last year's step count!

### Media Diet

Playing: Since we were on the go, I was only playing mobile/tablet games. Most often that was **Marvel Snap** (Deadpool's Diner is a bitch this time around; I am not yet done!), sometimes **Magic Arena** on the iPad (drains the battery far too quickly and also makes the tablet hot), and even some **Eternal Card Game** here and there!

Reading: I packed an IRL book as is my habit during these trips (a friend called it an "emotional support book"). Unfortunately I ended up mostly just reading comics during any downtime.

Watching: Netflix Japan had a lot of anime (unsurprising). Some of the AirBNBs we stayed at had nice TVs which we were able to use watch movies like **Deadpool and Wolverine** and **Bullet Train**, both of which I'd already seen before. There was also a lot of watching silly Japanese TV shows and ads.

### Other Stuff

Unfortunately, I don't have a lot of other things or links to share to post about this week. We will return to our regularly scheduled format next week!

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

It's December! There are so many things to do and things I want to catch up on before the year ends!
