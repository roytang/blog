### The World

- South Korean president Yoon Suk Yeol did not survive a second impeachment attempt
- There's talk of impeachment around here as well, for the VP this time, but I'm kinda fed up with local politics so I'm not really paying attention. Honestly it feels like more Pinoys are interested in/mad about a recent showbiz cheating scandal
- Mount Kanlaon on Negros Island erupted recently, covering nearby villages in ash.

### My Week

Kind of a stressful week, had to accompany patients to a number of lab tests and doctor consults and such and such. These always take a lot of time because there's always a lot of waiting wherever we go. It was a pleasant surprise when we went for a consult this one doctor who we'd only been teleconsulting with before; she was already there on schedule, AND there was only one person ahead of us in the queue and we only had to wait a few minutes. Sadly the exception rather than the rule.

Since it is December, the traffic everywhere has been very bad, even during the off hours.

For the past two weeks, we have had to live without a microwave. It is a modern convenience I feel like I had taken for granted and now it is painfully obvious how much we used it to reheat leftovers or various foods from 7-11. 

One of my brothers is migrating to another country at the end of the month, and they are disposing of a lot of things to make the move easier, so we are getting some stuff. Including a microwave, but that's not until next week!

Still spent a lot of time catching up on things.

### Media Diet

- Reading: New Sanderson book is out, started reading **Wind and Truth**, then I stopped after a couple of chapters and went to watch a YT recap of [Rhythm of War](/2020/12/rhythm-of-war/) first. Hoping to finish the book before EOY, which isn't a lot of time! Also a lot of comics as usual, especially while waiting in hospitals and clinics. Hoping to write one more ["complete Marvel run"](/tags/complete-marvel-run/) post before EOY.

- Watching: Finished my binge of **The Lincoln Lawyer** and also binged **The Diplomat** (2 seasons). Trying to keep up with: Star Trek Lower Decks, Dragon Ball Daima, Ranma 1/2, Dan Da Dan. There's also a bunch more TV shows I want to try to finish before EOY!

- Playing: 
    - Happy to find out that **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** is available on Game Pass AND that my PC can handle it! I'm only a couple of hours into the game though. 
    - I've also been plaing some **Final Fantasy X-2** for whatever reason lol. 
    - And I started trying out **Marvel Rivals**, though I am not yet very good at it. Also sporadically playing: Marvel Snap, Magic Arena, Street Fighter VI, King of Fighters XIV, etc.
    - Over on Mastodon, https://bitbang.social/@jibsaramnim was giving out copies of the Commandoes games of yore on Steam, and I happily availed the first two Commandoes games. I played through the first one back in the day, but the second is completely new to me. Hopefully I have some time to give them a try soon!

### Walking and Health

From Dec 08 (Sunday) to Dec 14 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 47,951 steps. A relaxed pace for me, but at this rate I will beat last year's step count total without the week, with a week to spare. Happy to stay at this relaxed pace until the new year starts.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

This week should be the penultimate immunotherapy session. Other than that, no scheduled medical errands for now, though they always seem to pop up unexpectedly sadly.

A bit more than a week left before Christmas! I have arbitrarily given myself a list of (too many things) I want to get done before the year ends, and there is precious little time remaining to get things done.
