title: My 2024 Gaming Roundup
toc: true
---

This is my personal 2024 gaming roundup! I usually include this sort of thing with my [yearnotes](/tags/yearnotes/), but I'm gonna start having them separate to spread the word count a bit. 

### Gaming Spend

- My overall gaming spend is down around 25% from last year.
- But somehow, I made more purchases this year. I will count 11 items this year, up from 5 last year.
    - Steam purchases:
        - Stellaris DLCs
        - Afterlife
        - Fallout 4
        - Hades
        - FFX/X-2 HD Remaster
        - Street Fighter 6 year 1 character pass
        - King of Fighters XIV
        - Dungeons of Hinterberg
        - Guilty Gear Strive season pass 1
        - (Notably all of these were via sales)
    - Nintendo Switch:
        - Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door
        - The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom
        - (As usual, Switch games are full-price purchases and honestly were probably at least 50% of my total gaming spend for the year)

### Overall

- Games "finished" (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete OR played a bunch of multiplayer on): 8, down from 11 last year.
    - **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** should probably count for this one, but I am not yet done, so it gets arbitrarily counted next year instead.
    - By genre: 4 RPGs, a platformer, a metroidvania, a zelda, a 4x strategy
    - By platform: 3 on Steam, 3 on PC game pass, 2 on Switch
    - [The list](/lists/media/games/2024/). See the games per platform below.

### Stats by Platform

(Stats might still be bumped a bit since the year is not yet done)

#### PC - Steam

- Total playtime for 2024: 455.45 hrs, slightly down from last year
- Games "finished": 3
    - [Civilization VI](/2024/07/civ6/)
    - [Hades](/2024/07/hades/)
    - [Afterimage](/2024/08/afterimage/)
- Othe most played games for 2024:
    - Marvel Snap (duh, see below)
    - [Stellaris](/2016/05/stellaris-review/): I played this a bunch early in the year because I bought a bunch of DLCs. I kinda want to write a second review at some point.
    - [Gloomhaven](/2022/12/gloomhaven/): After more than 3 years of playing this regularly on weekends, my gaming group finally completed the campaign!
- I also wanted to play more fighting games but honestly time has not been on my side in this regard. **Street Fighter 6** is very close to achievement completion and I purchased a season pass on sale. Also been playing some **KOF** and want to play more **Guilty Gear Strive** so I also got the first season pass for cheap. Hopefully I can play more of these in 2025!

#### PC - XBox Game Pass

PC Game Pass continues to be an excellent deal, despite a 2024 price bump.

- Total playtime for 2024: 196h, up a bit from last year
- Games "finished": 
    - [Persona 5 Tactica](/2024/02/persona-5-tactica/)
    - [Tales of Arise](/2024/04/tales-of-arise/)
    - [Starfield](/2024/11/starfield/)
- Additionally, **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** is almost done, though I still have completion stuff to do so I will finish it and write my review in January.

#### CCGs

- [Magic The Gathering](/tags/mtg/)
    - [My MTG Stats](/page/stats/mtg/)
    - [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena) did not give me any end of year stats this year.
        - Completely free to play this year
        - Have cut down on competitve play as well, entering no Arena Opens this year
        - Honestly kinda phoning it in this year. Have just been busy. I'm still in it, but not maxing my performance or anything like that.
    - Set recaps for the year:
        - [Lost Caverns of Ixalan](/2024/01/mtglci-set-recap/)
        - [Murders at Karlov Manor](/2024/04/mtgmkm-set-recap/)
        - [Outlaws of Thunder Junction](/2024/07/mtgotj-set-recap/)
        - [Modern Horizons 3](/2024/07/mtgmh3-set-recap/)
        - [Bloomburrow](/2024/10/bloomburrow/)
        - [Duskmourne House of Horror](/2024/11/duskmourn/)
- [Marvel Snap](/tags/marvel-snap)
    - Somehow I am still playing this game a lot and am still free-to-play, despite the terrible acquisition model. I even got all 4 of us brothers playing now, mostly so we could be in an alliance!
    - Adding some Snap season recaps below:

      {{< photos snap >}}

    
- [Eternal](/tags/eternalcardgame)
    - Not really playing this game a lot, but somehow it's still chugging along. Occasionally play it in bursts, and I sometimes try to go achievement hunting and completing single-player content. It feels like the game is close to shutting down, so if I want to complete achievements and the remaining SP content I really should do it in 2025.

#### Twitch

(Not really a gaming platform, but seemed relevant)

- streamed on 14 separate days, for a total streaming time of 25 hours, way down from 50 days/127 hours last year. I was just too busy or not too into it this year.
- currently at 39 followers, same as last year. The Twitch recap says I had 1 new follower, so there was one unfollow. Not surprising.

<time id="113687708384791424">[2024-12-21 07:19] </time> Twitch Recap! Not included in this image: I only streamed 14 times this year, way down from 50 last year. Sounds about right.

### Games I Did Not Finish

I usually only write reviews for games I manage to finish, so I thought I'd have some words here for games I played during the year and didn't finish for some reason.

#### Nine Sols

{{< photos Nine >}}

Such a gorgeous and well-animated pixel art metroidvania. But the reaction/parry-focused combat made it just a bit too difficult for me, so I just stopped playing after I got stuck at the boss in one of the screenshots above. Don't get me wrong, I have no doubt that given enough time and perseverence I can eventually figure out how to beat this boss, and same again for each successive boss. But I'm not that kind of gamer; there's a limit to how much time I'm willing to put into a single boss fight. I'm here to enjoy the experience, not to strive for technical mastery.

To be fair to the game, it does provide a "story mode" with easier combat I think. I did not bother trying it out.

#### Eiyuden Chronicles: Hundred Heroes

I really enjoyed the [Suikoden](/tags/suikoden/) series back in the day so I thought I would be into this, but I kind of got bored very early on into the game (the traditional JRPG story startup was taking too long) and just bounced off it. I didn't get too far in, but the Suikoden II parallels were plentiful. Not sure if I want to revisit.

#### Paper Mario: Thousand Year Door

Historically, I always have trouble getting into these Mario RPG types of games for some reason. I am maybe 10-20% into this game already but it just got lost with all the other things I was doing this year. I will probably try to get into it again in 2025.

---

### Summary

Overall kind of a chill gaming year, with some pleasant surprises (games I wasn't expecting to play). Among the ones I listed in [the 2024 checklist](/2024/01/2024-checklist/), I only played one lol.
