Doing this now because honestly I don't expect to be watching much in the last couple of days of the year.

### Movies

#### The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare (2024)

Watched on 2024-10-07: ★★★



{{% photos ministry-2024 %}}

 I think the trailer for this overhyped my expectations on how action-packed it would be. It's actually more of a stealth mission than anything else, and I felt a bit sleepy throughout the film's first half. While there's plenty of Nazi-killing going on, there never feels like there's a lot of tension or stakes because the protags are all portrayed as hypercapable action heroes who are never in any real danger. The most interesting moments are with Eiza Gonzalez's character, mostly because it actually feels like she is in peril. Was surprised to learn this was (very loosely) based on a true story. I'm not sure I'd sit through it again.

And... apparently that was the only new movie I saw in the past 3 months! I also rewatched **Deadpool and Wolverine** and **Bullet Train** while in Japan and had **Back to the Future** playing in the background during our immediate family get together on Christmas Eve, but not much else. All other movies I wanted to watch are relegated to next year!

### TV

Instead I used the last 3 months of the year to catch up on my TV viewing it seems.

#### Agatha All Along

I had low expectations for this one; honestly it was one of those instances where I was like 'Why the heck did they choose to make a series around this character?!?' But I was pretty satisfied with how it played out, and the Witches' Road song was pretty good and the whole ending bit was pretty clever. No real surprise as to the eventually revealed identity of "Teen", but it was executed well.

#### Only Murders in the Building S4

I've watched like 3 seasons of this show since [September](/2024/10/movies-tv-aug-sep-2024/#only-murders-in-the-building-s2-3), so they're all kinda blurring together for me so I have to remind myself that this is the season where they were solving Sazz' murder. I think the show manages to retain the same qualities more or less, though the connections being formed are getting zanier and zanier and less plausible, and they had to introduce a whole new wing of the Arconia so they can have more supporting characters/suspects that aren't just tired retreads of the previous residents. I can't believe they're still going for a season 5; one would think people would just stop living in the Arconia by now!

#### Boston Legal

DENNY CRANE!! 

I forget why I started watching this on Disney+ but I have absolutely no regrets. I loved **The Practice** back in the day so James Spader's character Alan Shore coming in with William Shatner's Denny Crane during the last season to take apart what once was Bobby Donnel's firm initially made him a villain in my eyes. I did love his performances in the few episodes of Boston Legal I caught back in the day. I think back then I mostly saw episodes from the last 2 seasons because when rewatching this recently I had no recollection of some of the season 1 and 2 supporting cast.

That being said, fantastic show, if only for Spader's drawn-out closing arguments (including one that's literally word salad) and the absolutely insane Denny Crane. 

I don't know if a show like this could be made today, where the two protagonists are a progressive liberal Democrat (Alan Shore) and a hardcore gun-toting pro-war conservative Republican (Denny Crane) who are best friends and who actually end up getting married by the end of the run! There is an episode where the Republican party tries to prank Denny Crane by nominating him for a presidential run and it's so weird seeing this in 2024 knowing that Denny Crane's insanity is probably comparable to the current US president-elect. 

#### Superman and Lois

I watched S3 and S4 (final season) recently. It's wild coming back to this show after S2 and seeing the new Jonathan Kent actor and having to do a double-take. That being said, these last 2 seasons are great, giving us a pretty solid adaptation of popular Superman characters (despite all the whiny teenager bits), especially given all the constraints they had to work with. The Doomsday fights were absolutely brutal and Michael Cudlitz's rage-filled Lex Luthor was terrifying. Despite the shortened final season schedule they managed to end on a high note with a fantastic "rest of your life" sequence to give as much closure as the could give.

It was ultimately a good decision to have this show happen in a separate universe than the rest of the Arrowverse, as it allowed for better stories to be told. For one thing, Jon Cryer's Lex Luthor would have not worked at all with this show's tone! That being said, this show ending is an ending to the Arrowverse as a while again, an end to a long era of live-action DC superhero shows. I should write an Arrowverse retrospective at some point.

#### Star Trek: Lower Decks

Lower Decks' final season continues to be excellent; the seemingly disparate early adventures came together in a two-part finale that was both cameo-filled and showed the best of the Lower Decks crew. The series title isn't really appropriate anymore since the main characters have since been promoted and are spending more time on the bridge, so it was a good place to end. That being said, there is still a lot of space left to explore with the crew of the Cerritos; I suspect they are likely to come back in some form sooner or later.

#### The Diplomat

{{< photos Diplomat >}}

I mostly watched this because the second season just dropped and my Dad kept raving about how good it was (and the seasons weren't very long). It was in fact very good, showing us how much messy work happens behind the scenes in diplomacy and intelligence work. I am glad I watched it after the second season dropped because this was a story that absolutely could have been told in one season and that S1 cliffhanger would have been so annoying. S2 ends with a surprise but also a clean break from the "conspiracy" of the last 2 seasons, which is all I want from this type of show: some closure!

#### Dandadan

I binge-read the manga for this earlier this year (I am due to write some more manga reviews at some point) and enjoyed it a lot so I was happy that the anime was coming out. The animation in the show is good and super trippy and the other day I ended up watching [an effusive animation breakdown for episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-MgRJiVZ-Q) so it's not just me. The [opening theme by Creepy Nuts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4na2opArGY) is a bop! Season 1 ends with only 12 episodes and cuts right in the middle of one of my favorite story arcs so that was kinda annoying, but the show is already renewed for another season in 2025 so I am looking forward to that.

#### Ranma 1/2

{{< photos Ranma >}}

Ranma 1/2 was a formative manga for me and I recently re-read the manga (again, I am due to write a Rumiko Takahashi tribute post at some point) and I am glad this anime is able to re-popularize the story for a new generation of fans. The animation looks great and honestly I still found myself laughing at many of the gags even though THEY ARE THE SAME GAGS FROM BEFORE!!

There was a lot I missed that I still want to watch. Notably The Penguin has been getting rave reviews, hopefully I can get to it next year. Dragon Ball Daima and Abbott Elementary S4 are still ongoing so I'll cover those next year!
