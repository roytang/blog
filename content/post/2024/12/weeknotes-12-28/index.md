2024 is almost done. Outside of a few bright spots, it has been a challenging year for me and honestly I am not really feeling the transition from this year to the next. Normally around this time of the year I'd already be working on my year-end and year-start posts but I have not yet found the time nor the energy this year, so they will probably be coming a bit late.

### My Week

The week was busy. We had gotten patient #3's test results last Monday that confirmed our fears and set off a flurry of activity like scheduling chemo sessions and further tests and consultations and working out financial assistance and such, all of which were complicated by all the holidays making it difficult to schedule things. 24 and 25 were reserved for family events, but the rest of the week I had to worry about all these other things. While they didn't take up too much time I did find that I didn't have the energy to work on other things I wanted to do and so I didn't do much else.

We did manage to do our extended family celebrations on the 24th and 25th. Both the immediate family and extended family get-togethers were good and fun and chaotic with all the kids and everything. I gave out a lot of the stuff I brought back from Japan! Goodbyes were kind of bittersweet this year as one of our family units is migrating to another country, so this is the last we will see of them for a while. Tears were definitely shed. 

Most of my reviews are probably delayed to next year, but I did manage to write [another Complete Marvel Run post](/2024/12/cmr-hulk-2/) last Friday.

### Media Diet

- Reading: Not a lot! Progress on **Wind and Truth** has stalled. I read just enough comics to get a blog post out, but other than that progress has been slow.

- Watching: No new series added. Still following the anime: Dandadan (no ep last week?), Ranma and Dragon Ball Daima. I have lost access to Disney+, so I have not seen the new What If yet. Not sure when I will sub. I also usually try to watch a few movies in the last week of the year to up my year-end count, but I don't think that's happening this year. The last movie I've watched was in October!

- Playing: 
    - I am close to finishing **Indiana Jones and the Great Circle** (beautiful game) but with all the completion stuff I don't know if I can finish it and write a review before EOY. I have encountered the additional problem that if I play it for too long I start to get a bit dizzy (a general problem I encounter with first-person games), so I am unlikely to push it.
    - When I'm busy, my multiplayer grinding comes back down to the two regulars: **Magic Arena**, **Marvel Snap**. Hopefully we have time for more/other games next year.

### Walking and Health

From Dec 22 (Sunday) to Dec 28 (Saturday), Google Fit says I walked 33,637 steps. Not a lot, but that still already puts me 40k above last year's total step count.

### Some Links of Interest

No new links to share right now unfortunately.

Check out the [linkblog](/links/) for past links!

Last year I had time to do [an end-of-year linkdump](/2023/12/2023-linkdump/). Not sure if I have time to do another one for this year. I can still do a 2024 linkdump in early 2025 right?

My feed reader backlog is still above 300 items.

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

Everything through Wednesday is a holiday, though we are still doing some labs and teleconsult. 

Patient #3 is scheduled for chemo on Thu and Fri, and we expect to be there all day. Sigh.

I wish you all a happy new year. May 2025 treat us better than 2024 did.
