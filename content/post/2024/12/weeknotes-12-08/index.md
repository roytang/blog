### The World

Kind of an eventful week:

- China has once again been bullying PH ships in our own sovereign waters, triggering even more diplomatic protests.
- In South Korean, president Yoon Suk Yeol made a late night declaration of martial law, something that hasn't happened there since 1979. Parliament members snuck past military personel and climbed walls in order to vote the rescind the martial law declaration not six hours after it happened. President Yoon then managed to survive an impeachment vote and there are still persistent calls for his resignation.
- In France, prime minister Barnier was ousted in a vote of no confidence, the first time since 1962. Barnier now holds the distinction of being the shortest-serving PM in French history.
- The Notre Dame cathedral has reopened following the fire in 2019.
- Just hours ago, Syrian rebels forced out dictator Assad from Damascus, from where he has ruled for 24 years.

### My Week

After coming back from my trip, I was looking forward to a chill last month of the year. We had two immunotherapy sessions remaining and everything seems smooth sailing. But life never gives us what we expect; early this week we got some bad news and now a second household member is facing a potential cancer diagnosis, which means for me more medical errands and assistance I have to provide. Sigh.

I also spent a good part of the week unpacking, logging stuff from the trip, starting some routines back up, and getting through some tasks that got defered during the past two weeks. It was a new month too, so all the usual end-of-month bills and business needed to be done.

On the blog: I managed to write 3,000+ words about [my recent Japan trip](/2024/12/japan2024/). I thought about splitting it up into multiple posts but eh, I'm sure future me will like reading this huge one. 

### Media Diet

- Reading: Not a lot this week.

- Watching: I was hoping to use December to watch a bunch of movies but now I'm thinking maybe I'll use it to watch some TV series instead? I spent the first couple of days back catching back on missed eps from the past 2 weeks. This week was the series finale of **Superman and Lois**, it was pretty good. I've also been binging **The Lincoln Lawyer** over on Netflix, because I'm a sucker for a good lawyer show.

- Playing: Took some Steam Sale damage as soon as I got back. During the trip one of my friends was playing **Hearthstone** anytime I was playing **Marvel Snap**, and that enticed me to load up my old account and try a few games and get some free stuff. That game remains very confusing to play and IDK if I'd keep playing. Speaking of Snap, I finally managed to get Etri from Deadpool Diner, as much of a slog as it was the first time. The Snap community is kind of in uproar over the poor economy and I'm a bit worried that it's not gonna last much longer. Also managed to sneak in some Foundations drafts in **Magic Arena**; though given the past couple of weeks I'm way behind on dailies and such and suspect I'm not gonna be able to complete this season's mastery pass. Managed to sneak in some **Eternal Card Game** here and there as well. Also started playing **Final Fantasy X-2** on Steam for some reason. Lots of different games, mostly because I needed the stress release!

It wasn’t enough that he worked long and hard at a problem; it wasn’t enough that he took some time to rest; it was necessary, also, for him to go to the sea, to walk along the bluff—to welcome solitude and to let it do its work."

    > "The reasoning for bringing in AI tools to monitor patients is always that it will make life easier for us, but in my experience, technology in healthcare rarely makes things better. It usually just speeds up the factory floor, squeezing more out of us, so they can ultimately hire fewer of us.

    > “Efficiency” is a buzzword in Silicon Valley, but get it out of your mind when it comes to healthcare. When you’re optimizing for efficiency, you’re getting rid of redundancies. But when patients’ lives are at stake, you actually want redundancy. You want extra slack in the system. You want multiple sets of eyes on a patient in a hospital.

    > When you try to reduce everything down to a machine that one person relies on to carry out decisions, then there’s only one set of eyes on that patient. That may be efficient, but by creating efficiency, you’re also creating a lot of potential points of failure. So, efficiency isn’t as efficient as tech bros think it is."

### This Coming Week (and Beyond!)

This week I will have support errands for three different patients, which is exciting. There's also the usual Christmas season stuff; need to see some people, ship some goods etc. 

I think there's some new stuff coming out this week I might want to read/watch/play but I'm a bit behind on everything so the only thing I remember right now is that the new Stormlight Archive book is coming out this week!
