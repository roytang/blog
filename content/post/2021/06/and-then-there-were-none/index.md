title: 'Book Review: And Then There Were None by Agatha Chrstie'
---

After reading [a couple of Hercule Poirot mysteries](https://roytang.net/2021/05/orient-express-nile/), I decided to try an Agatha Christie book from outside that series. I found that *And Then There Were None* was one of those commonly appearing on lists of her best works, and the concept intrigued me: Ten people are invited to an island and get trapped there and then murders start to happen. 

Kind of hard to talk about it without spoiling too much (and what I've said might already have been spoilers!).

It's one of those things where the whole setup seems super contrived and way too clever for it to ever happen in real life, but the explanation / solution at the end mostly works out and actually makes sense. It was maybe something you could have predicted if you had paid attention to all the little details about the people and their personalities and the actual deaths.

It's not a long book. I finished the book in 4 sittings, with the last sitting covering the last half of the book; this is a typical speed for me once a book really gets going, I'll have a hard time putting it down until I'm done. 

I'm enjoying these mysteries, and I find that it's a bit weird that I haven't really read these kinds of mystery novels before. I've read stuff when I was younger like the Encyclopedia Brown stuff where you're challenged to solve the mystery, etc, but no real mystery novels like this I think. I guess I've kind of expanded my reading horizons now? That's a good thing!
