I like keeping around my content for a similar reason as above: they may reflect thoughts or opinions that are not the same as those I hold today. They reflect a past version of me and my thoughts and I like that past me lives on in some way on this site, even if present-day me may already be a different person. I make sure that every post on this

That being said, I can appreciate the above thought, since I'm sure I've tweeted a lot of nonsense over the years that's not really useful to retain. During the recent weeks, I've started slowly going through the old Twitter posts archived here on this site and deleting some old stuff that for sure I have no interest in retaining. Examples of what I'm deleting: tweets for joining giveaways, tweets promoting sales, test tweets, etc. Basically anything not related to something I was actually doing or a thought or opinion I'm expressing.
