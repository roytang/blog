Today is father's day. If you're lucky enough to have a good father in your life, be sure to show your appreciation. Today's weeknotes are shorter than usual for some reason.

### A quote

> "My goal is to build a life I don't need a vacation from." - Rob Hill Sr.

### The world:

- [The International Criminal Court is proceeding with a probe into Duterte's drug war](https://www.axios.com/philippines-drugs-war-duterte-icc-investigation-16cbf5d0-8aa3-4e10-a773-6798c0fc4952.html). The admin is all like "ha ha we don't care, you have no basis, we won't cooperate, etc etc", but despite the posturing, it kind of feels like they're a bit scared.
- On the pandemic front, NCR is now on GCQ "with less restrictions" mode or whatever it is they're calling it this week. NCR cases are going down (but still a lot), but cases in Visayas and Mindanao are on the rise. Davao in particular is a hotspot, and coincidentally, it looks the bulk of what little Pfizer we had is going there too. Luckily, just today the government announced they've [sealed a deal for 40M more Pfizer doses](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1448436/ph-seals-deal-for-40-m-doses-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine); hopefully they arrive in a timely manner as that should greatly help with vaccine hesitancy.
- In comic book news, Batman got into a bit of controversy this week when [DC apparently claims there are certain things he just can't do](https://twitter.com/JoeOtterson/status/1404495349520244736). Zack Snyder tried [to get in on the fun](https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1405702805948538881) but nobody knows where he got that image.

### My stuff:

- Seems like I had a relatively chill / relaxed week, which is good because last week was a bit stressful. I did have a bunch of family errands and escort missions to do, but nothing too major.
- Still [sketching](/albums/sketchbook/); this week, I had fun drawing Spider-man villain Sandman playing around in a sandcastle:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: Only one movie again this week, continuing the James Bond run: [Octopussy (1983)](/2021/06/1639118365d91bdbd1a41eb9b170a9a0/). Only one more Moore to go! I also wanted to watch **Rurouni Kenshin: The Final**, which came out on PH Netflix last Friday, but haven't found the time yet.
    - My regular background watching this week was seasons 2 and 3 of **Schitt's Creek**, and I'm already halfway through season 4 now.
    - This week's episode of **Loki** felt a bit meh and mostly setup, but I must admit I am enjoying Owen Wilson's performance and his back-and-forth with Tom Hiddleston.
- **Gaming**:
    - Spent the week clearing up all the pending non-main quest stuff in **Horizon Zero Dawn** on PS4, including the hunting trials and all the collectibles. I believe only main quest and ancient armory remain. Still have yet to do any Frozen Wilds content though. 
    - Regular Saturday group played some [Root](/2021/05/root/) and [Blood Rage](/2021/03/blood-rage/) this weekend.
    - Been playing **Guilty Gear Strive** on a regular basis during weeknights. I'm trying to get through all the missions since GGS is fairly complicated with a lot of systems and mechanics, and the missions are very good as a tutorial. I typically do a few missions per night then play around 9 games online (3 sets vs 3 different opponents). I am not very good at the game, but I am having fun, and I really like how it's much easier to find matches compared to SFV.
- **Reading**: Still reading: **Linchpin** by Seth Godin. 
- Trivia team got second place in this week's comedy-themed About Quiz.
- Got some positive feedback this week on some stuff I've done, in a couple of different realms. Positive feedback is always great, tell people if you enjoy their work!

### This coming week:

- New Loki episode this wednesday!
- New Rick and Morty season beings this week
- Two quiz nights this coming week!
