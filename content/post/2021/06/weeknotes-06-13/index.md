These weeknotes are being published a day late, for reasons that will be discussed later.

### A quote

> "The price of being a sheep is boredom. The price of being a wolf is loneliness. Choose one or the other with great care." - Hugh MacLeod

### The world:

- Early last week, [a slew of big websites went offline due to some problems at a CDN](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-08/fastly-outage-shows-web-still-vulnerable-to-key-provider-failure?sref=E9Urfma4), which is some kind of testament to the problems with centralization, but my favorite part of that story was that tech news site *The Verge* did their reporting from a Google doc during the outage but they [accidentally tweeted the edit link instead](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1402221764776714243) so for a short while everyone was reporting for them.
- Kim Jong-Un [called K-Pop a "vicious cancer"](https://news.yahoo.com/kim-jong-un-calls-k-121112259.html). Not saying I agree or disagree (hey, let K-Pop fans have their fun!), but it would be so amusing if K-Pop really does bring down the North Korean regime.
- Apple is introducing a new "privacy relay" feature which for some reason related to regulations [they can't apply to the Philippines](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1402080413628071936/)
- a local newborn was named HTML, as in [HyperText Markup Language](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1403247589395296258/). This got some people digging out that time there was one family named [Macaroni 85, Spaghetti 88 and Sincerely Yours 98](https://news.abs-cbn.com/lifestyle/01/10/14/meet-siblings-macaroni-85-spaghetti-88-sincerely-yours-98).
- Last Saturday was Philippine Independence Day. On the same day, opposition coalition 1Sambayan [nominated 6 people to run for president or vice president in the elections next year](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/06/12/2104994/1sambayan-reveals-6-nominees-president-vice-president-2022). Many have expressed misgivings about some of their choices. While I think it's way too early for this kind of positioning, I think I would seriously consider any of these people should they decide to run, except for Villanueva lol.

### From the archives, this week in history:

- 2019: [We went to Disneyland!](/2019/06/us-2019-theme-parks/). This was the last time I was out of the country. 
- 2018: [We went to Kuala Lumpur to play in an RPTQ!](/2018/06/kuala-lumpur-and-the-mtg25a-rptq/)
- 2017: I finished [Persona 5](/2017/06/review-persona-5-you-never-saw-it-coming/)! Wow, it's already 4 years ago. I haven't played Royal yet.
- 2014: [I got an Instagram account](/2014/06/476353556467814400/) because someone else used my email to sign up
- 2010: I scrubbed out of [Grand Prix Manila 2010](/2010/06/grand-prix-manila/). 
- 2009: Magic introduces [the M10 rules changes](/2009/09/m10-set-recap/#previews), damage no longer uses the stack!

### My stuff:

- Okay, so the reason this post is delayed is because I [did another game jam this weekend](/2021/06/1404312180720226305/) and only made the submission around 10pm last night so that kind of used up most of my weekend time. I'll do a separate post about the game jam sometime this week!
- Still [sketching](/albums/sketchbook/), though I had to skip the past two days because of the game jam thingy, so I'm behind again, which isn't unusual. I did use up the free draw friday slot to draw the splash screen art for the game jam entry:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: Managed another James Bond film this week: [For Your Eyes Only (1981)](/2021/08/movies-tv-may-aug-2021/#for-your-eyes-only-1981). I think we're only a couple of films away from the end of Moore's tenure, then it's two Daltons, and finally the modern era (i.e. the ones where I actually caught some of them on film) of Pierce Brosnan
    - For my background watching during the game jam weekend, I watched the first season of **Schitt's Creek**, which I've heard good things about. The first season was ok, so I went ahead and queued up the next two season too.
    - Last Wednesday was the first episode of **Loki**! I enjoy this slow drip of MCU content, and the Timekeepers/TVA add a new aspect to the MCU's universe/multiverse. One can't help but think the multiversal status quo will be upset at the end of this series though, especially given some of the rumors about future films.
    - Last week I shared a video of [Bo Burnham's "Welcome to the Internet"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1BneeJTDcU) and this week I decided to watch his special **"Inside"** on Netflix, from where the song came from. It's pretty good, and probably took him forever to do.
- **Gaming**:
    - I think I'm close to the end game in the main quest of **Horizon Zero Dawn** on PS4, but I'm spending some time cleaning up quests and collecting collectibles and such. Still playing [Root](/2021/05/root/) with the regular Saturday group. 
    - Last Friday I went ahead and purchased **Guilty Gear Strive** on Steam. Was only able to play a few games online before I had to do the game jam stuff, but at least I managed to win my first ranked match! I'm hoping to have this replace the daily Street Fighter games I used to do, except hopefully it's much easier to find matches since it's a new release. And of course, I'm hoping I actually get good at it.
- **Reading**: I started reading **Linchpin** by Seth Godin which is a book from like 2008, and I've had a copy of it since forever. 
- Trivia team only got sixth place in last weekend's About Quiz, because we always do poorly when it's horror themed.

### This coming week:

- New Loki episode this wednesday!
- It's E3 this past weekend and this week, I think, so there should be a lot of gaming news. Although given my massive gaming backlogs, I'm not often excited by new game announcements.
