June is almost upon us, hopefully bringing some respite from the scorching summer heat.

This year feels like it's passing by very quickly.

### A quote

> There is a vitality, a life force, an energy, a quickening that is translated through you into action, and because there is only one of you in all of time, this expression is unique. And if you block it, it will never exist through any other medium and it will be lost. The world will not have it. It is not your business to determine how good it is nor how valuable nor how it compares with other expressions. It is your business to keep it yours clearly and directly, to keep the channel open. -- Martha Graham, quoted by Agnes DeMille

### The world:

- Belarus earned the ire of non-authoritarian states anywhere [when they diverted a plane to arrest an opposition journalist](https://www.metafilter.com/191570/The-death-penalty-awaits-me-Belarus-diverts-plane-to-arrest-journalist). Belarus is ruled by president Lukashenko, who has held the office since it was created in 1994 (!), and [critics have said he is turning Belarus into the North Korea of Europe](https://www.euronews.com/2021/05/26/lukashenko-is-turning-belarus-into-the-north-korea-of-europe-says-sviatlana-tsikhanouskaya). My only experience with Belarus before was that I used to work with a company that had a remote dev team in Minsk, during which I was surprised by how third-world their consulting rates were, compared to the rest of Europe. Now that I know they're ruled by a tin-pot dictator, I'm no longer surprised.
- Tech: Google [is going to remove unlimited photo storage by June 1](https://www.inc.com/minda-zetlin/google-photos-unlimited-storage-ending-amazon-microsoft-adobe.html). After reading this, I decided to also clean up some large files from my Google Drive, since the disk quota is now going to be shared across Photos, Drive and GMail. 
- I don't have any covid19 updates today. Cases are starting to tick up again though now that restrictions have been loosened.

### My stuff:

- The [DIY fix for my fitbit strap](/2021/05/1396076491021058050/) didn't even last an entire week! I ordered a new one as soon as it broke last Friday. The package arrived today! And... I accidentally ordered a small size when I needed a large lol. I can still use it by pairing with the unbroken half of my old strap, but still, pretty dumb of me. =/
- Still [sketching](/albums/sketchbook/), although I'm starting to have trouble keeping up, I was a couple of days behind for most of the week yesterday. I liked this one I did of a kid on a giant chessboard, but playing around with the perspective guide on Procreate really made the final sketch weird:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: None this week sadly. Need to watch more movies this coming week.
- **Gaming**:
    - Still playing a bunch of **Horizon Zero Dawn** on PS4 (probably only halfway through the main game content) and [Root](/2021/05/root/) with the regular Saturday group.
    - Been losing a bunch on **Street Fighter V** so I'm taking a break. Been thinking of getting into a different fighting game, preferably one with a more active playerbase so I don't have to spend an hour trying to find more than one opponent. Coincidentally, Guilty Gear Strive comes out in June! We'll see.
- **Reading**: I finished a [couple of Hercule Poirot books](/2021/05/orient-express-nile/) recently. Not yet sure what I'm reading next.
- If you're following my [twitter triviabot](https://twitter.com/triviastorm), I'm planning to reset the scores and start a new season at the end of month (i.e. tomorrow)

### This coming week:

- my parents are getting their second vaccine dose this week!
