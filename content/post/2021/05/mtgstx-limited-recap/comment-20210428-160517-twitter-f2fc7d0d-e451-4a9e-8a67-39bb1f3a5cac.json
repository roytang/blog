Probably won't have the full episode on YT (maybe just the last few matches). But spoiler alert: I was able to break my unlucky streak with some Quandrix + Prismari goodness!\n\nOkay, I was able to record the draft itself locally, so this draft has two videos. In order:\n\n\n\nPart 1 (draft): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skUg-kWzq_g\n\n\n\nPart 2 (last few matches): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SuXcPVm0YQ",
