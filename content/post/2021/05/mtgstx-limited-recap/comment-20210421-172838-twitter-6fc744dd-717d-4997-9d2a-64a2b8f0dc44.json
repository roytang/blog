  "text": "Wednesday afternoon Strixhaven draft(s?)! https://www.twitch.tv/twitchyroy #mtg #magicarena #twitch #strixhaven\n\nHad a great draft! I went Quandrix+Prismari and managed to go 7-2. Very explosive. One of those losses was actually due to the server giving me a defeat without even going to a match, so I might even get reimbursement!\n\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZh3aDWWcdQ",
