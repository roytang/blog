Notes:

- I remember Strixhaven to be quite a fun draft format, probably because it was so easy to splash things. More than half of the events I had splash additional colors!
- by Main Color:
    - Amazingly, I was able to try out only 5 of the ten available color pairs! 
    - Most of my drafts went Silverquill (WB) or UG (Quandrix)
    - Quandrix was my winningest archetype with Silverquill a distant second; the other two pairs I managed to try were very poor
    - Not reflected in the stats above, but Quandrix was easily the most splashable pair, which was why I played it a lot. Most often splash was red, and one event I was able to splash all 3 other colors!
- by Color: This is the rare occasion where green is my best color for the format; usually I have trouble getting into green because of poor removal options.
- By Format: this was the last format (before I started tracking stats in Neon Dynasty) where I did relatively well in the high-stakes event, winning 3000 gems from the Sealed Open

Not a lot of insights, mostly because I'm doing this post from the future and not a lot of it is fresh for me.
