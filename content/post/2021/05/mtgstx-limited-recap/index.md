### Limited Notes

- I remember Strixhaven to be quite a fun draft format, probably because it was so easy to splash things. More than half of the events I had splash additional colors!
- by Main Color:
    - Amazingly, I was able to try out only 5 of the ten available color pairs! 
    - Most of my drafts went Silverquill (WB) or UG (Quandrix)
    - Quandrix was my winningest archetype with Silverquill a distant second; the other two pairs I managed to try were very poor
    - Not reflected in the stats above, but Quandrix was easily the most splashable pair, which was why I played it a lot. Most often splash was red, and one event I was able to splash all 3 other colors!
- by Color: This is the rare occasion where green is my best color for the format; usually I have trouble getting into green because of poor removal options.
- By Format: this was the last format (before I started tracking stats in Neon Dynasty) where I did relatively well in the high-stakes event, winning 3000 gems from the Sealed Open

Not a lot of insights, mostly because I'm doing this post from the future and not a lot of it is fresh for me.

<time>[Sat, May 22, 2021, 7:34 p.m.]</time>I actually posted a note on my STX stats, which predates my current limited stats spreadsheet!

Just based on my public drafts, my Strixhaven limited win/loss record is at 54%

I actually started checking this because [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/spikes/comments/ni948c/in_less_than_24_hours_strixhaven_draft_challenge/) claimed that if your win% is at least 56% then the upcoming draft challenge should be profitable, so I just miss that threshold lol. Area for improvement!

### Arena Open

Threw some gems away again on this month's #magicarena #mtgstrixhaven sealed open, ended up playing Silverquill splashing red since I had Professor Onyx and Lukka.

### Magic Arena Stats

<time>[Sat, July 10, 2021, 5:41 a.m.]</time> Final #mtgstrixhaven stats on #MagicArena. I'm glad they send out these summaries. Looks like I haven't managed to hit mythic since Kalhdeim. The limited format was pretty fun though. #MTGArenaStats
