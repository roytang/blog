Gonna attempt this today. I have poor manual dexterity so I expect it to be terrible #onepiece

Most challenging part for me and my shaky fingers are the tiny tiny stickers. I apologize in advance to anyone offended by my poor sticker application.

Starting to come together. I've already lost one tiny sticker

I did poorly applying the jolly roger sticker to the sail, and the rear deck is a bit loose, but I guess I can live with those. Low standards!

This was Going Merry from the One Piece Grand Ship collection. I actually got this kit waaay back in 2017 from the now-defunct One Piece exhibit at the Tokyo Tower in Japan, took me forever to decide to put it together (because I knew I would be terrible at it lol)
