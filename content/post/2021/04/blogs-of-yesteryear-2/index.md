title: Blogs of Yesteryear Part 2
---

This is a follow up to ["Blogs of Yesteryear"](/2021/04/blogs-of-yesteryear/). This is the remainder of my blogroll from 2004/2005. I feel like the second half is less interesting than the first half, but I figured I might as well go through them as well.

### geekiness

I think the blogs under this session are about general geeky topics.

- **Absurd Genius** - looks this was a tech and gaming-focused blog that featured a web portal for the PSP browser. But I couldn't find anymore information about the author. It was formerly hosted on base2.org, but that domain doesn't seem to have any content now.
- **Forever Geek** - this was a blog that covered a lot of geeky topics - tech, anime, gadgets, games, etc. It's [still around](https://forevergeek.com/)! I no longer follow them though, mainly because that's not really the sort of site I follow anymore.
- **kuro5hin** - this was a slashdot-like discussion site that was a bit popular back in the day. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuro5hin), the site was taken down permanently in 2016. Kuro5hin was owned by Rusty Foster, who now writes a newsletter, [Today in Tabs](https://www.todayintabs.com/), one of the [newsletters I follow](/2021/02/newsletters-redux/).

### gaming

I followed a lot of gaming sites back in the day. I no longer follow these, mostly because I'm not interested anymore in having 100% gaming feeds in my feedreader.

- **game girl advance** - a gaming blog with all women writers. Back then most of the people writing about games were male (I think), so following a site like this one helped diversify your POVs. The site is [still up](https://www.gamegirladvance.com/), but the last update is from 2015.
- **GameDevBlog** - this is a blog by game developer Jamie Fristrom. I think I followed this site after I read an interesting article he wrote about implementing web-swinging in the 2004 videogame Spider-man 2. His [site is still up](https://www.gamedevblog.com/) and updated as recently as last October!
- **Games from Within** - this was another game developer's blog (in case it isn't obvious, it is/was one of my interests). The [site is still up](https://gamesfromwithin.com/), last post is from 2018. (Annoyingly, it's one of those sites that doesn't show the post date on the listing screens.)
- **RPGamer** - a gaming site focused on computer/console RPGs. This and [RPGFan](https://www.rpgfan.com/) were my main source of RPG news back in the day. RPGamer is [still up](https://rpgamer.com/) and going strong. (The site even still has the same dragon logo and font!)
- **These Damned Machines Are Killing Me** - another gaming focused blog, this one was short-lived, looks like it wasn't updated past 2007, after which the site went down. The [URL](http://www.damnedmachines.com/) currently redirects to a site called Furious Games, not sure if related.
- **3rd World Game Designer** - this was a blog by Gabby Dizon, a game designer from the Philippines! (I'm always interested in local content). The site is no longer accessible and the domain is parked. I think I found the author on Twitter, but he seems to be a crypto guy now or some such.

### comics

I still read webcomics these days, though not as much, and almost never through a feed reader (most of the time.) Related: [Webcomics I Like, 2006 Edition](/2006/10/webcomics-i-like-2006-edition/).

- **PvPonline** - this was a webcomic about the employees at a gaming publication, it was quite popular back in the day. The [site is still up](http://pvponline.com/) and the author recently rebooted/time-skipped the story. I currently follow [the author on Twitter](https://twitter.com/pvponline) and catch up on it whenever I see him update.
- **Penny Arcade** - one of the longest-running mostly-gaming-focused webcomics (and one of the most well-known). The [site is still going strong](https://www.penny-arcade.com/) after all these years, sporting largely the same color scheme. I get updates because I follow [the artist on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cwgabriel).
- **Comics: Foxtrot** - one of my favorite slice of life strips, I have a few of the books. It stopped being released as a daily a while back, and the author now only releases a new comic every Sunday, I think. Once again, I am following [the artist on twitter](https://twitter.com/billamend). (Starting to see a pattern here.)
- **Comics: Sinfest** - it started out as a dark humor strip about this guy Slick who tries to hit on a girl named Monique and just kept expanding and expanding its scope, covering topics such as politics, patriarchy, religion, that kind of stuff. It's [still running](https://sinfest.net/) but I mostly lost interest when he tended to do arcs that ran really long. I much preferred his silly, standalone strips like [this one about Apples and Oranges](https://www.sinfest.net/view.php?date=2004-04-05). Here's [another one that I liked](/2010/08/1042004246/).
- **Dilbert** - this famous strip is of course still running (currently at [Dilbert.com](https://dilbert.com/)), although the author has in recent years come out as Trump supporter with many bad takes. I still read the strip, mostly because it comes with our daily newspaper. (On paper! We still have those!)
- **Real life comics** - this was a semi-autobiographical slice-of-life comic about a guy named Greg. I had stopped following it for a while because of reasons, but last year I found out that (a) it was still going strong; and (b) the author recently [came out as as trans](https://twitter.com/reallifecomics/status/1284587454968651777). The strip is [still running](https://www.reallifecomics.com/index.php)!
- **Comics: Calvin and Hobbes** - the quintessential comic about a little kid and his tiger. I'm not sure why I bothered following this one, since the author stopped drawing the strip in 1995. I believe that I have already read every single strip of C&H, so there's no reason to follow it now.
- **Websnark** - this was a commentary blog about stuff on the internet, mostly webcomics. I don't remember following it for too long, probably lost interest at some point. The domain currently has nothing.

### lifehacks

These are blogs I followed about self-improvement, productivity, that kind of stuff.

- **Working Smart** - looks like this was a blog from a guy who was head of a Christian publishing company. I guess I followed him because he sometimes published about topics like getting things done, communication, tech, gadgets, and blogging. I don't remember following him for very long, so I imagine I lost interest quickly. The site is no longer accessible and he no longer seems to be blogging.
- **Steve Pavlina's Blog** - this is a guy who became well-known as a self-help author and motivational speaker. He often wrote about personal development. I'm not really into that kind of content anymore so I no longer follow him. He still writes at stevepavlina.com.
- **43 Folders** - a site about "tricks, hacks and other cool stuff", named after the number of manila folders in a tickler file. The site is [still around](http://www.43folders.com/), but the last update is from 2011. I'm currently following [the author on twitter](https://twitter.com/hotdogsladies), he no longer seems to be blogging and is more of a podcaster now.

### feed readers

According to the old site, my feeds back then were powered by an app called Bloglines. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloglines) says Bloglines became unavailable in 2015, but presumably I stopped using it in 2007 when I [switched to a different app called Newshutch](/2007/01/newshutch-feed-aggregator/). At the time, I was complaining that [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader), released in 2007, was "slow as molasses"! I eventually did migrate to Google Reader and was a faithful user until [it was killed off in 2013](/2013/06/347364993144074241/). (In hindsight, this was more recent than I thought it was!)

### what about now?

I follow a mostly different set of blogs now. There's [a blogroll](/page/blogroll/), but it's a touch out of date and could use some updating. Maybe sometime soon. Looking over the list, it seems I prefer not to follow single-topic blogs anymore and enjoy slice-of-life blogs where people talk about their day-to-day pursuits on a personal level (instead of say, writing as a general-purpose article for any reader). Feel free to send me blogs or blogrolls you recommend, I will gladly spend an hour or so scrolling through a blogroll and clicking through links and checking out blogs!
