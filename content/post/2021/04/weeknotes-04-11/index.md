### The world:

- Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh and Queen Elizabeth's husband, has passed away. So has DMX, American rapper.
- Big facebook breach reported, etc. Doesn't seem like news, really. My [phone number was among the data leaked](/2021/04/1379404077319168000/).
- The country is still experiencing a surge in cases, hospitals and  ICUs still bursting to capacity. Yet in spite of the crisis, the president has not been around. This has prompted questions of whether he's  still alive. This in turn prompted multiple proof-of-life photos and videos from the senator-who-is-also-presidential-assistant, some of which [may or may have been photoshopped](https://twitter.com/News5PH/status/1380408229495119875). We are told he will make a public appearance Monday.
- Speaking of the president, it feels like an ABS-CBN reporter did more to defend our sovereignty vs China when [they went to report on Chinese vessels near Ayungin Shoal and were harassed for their trouble](https://news.abs-cbn.com/news/multimedia/slideshow/04/09/21/china-boat-chase-abscbn-news-team-chiara-zambrano).
- After two weeks of ECQ, the NCR+ bubble is [now placed under MECQ status until the end of the month](https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1381142347489013761). No, I have no idea what that means.
- Once again, the Philippines in the international news after [a man died because he was made to do 300 squats for breaking curfew](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/04/07/world/covid-vaccine-coronavirus-cases?#a-man-died-after-being-forced-to-do-300-squats-for-breaking-curfew-in-the-philippines).
- It's Wrestlemania weekend! And apparently it's a two-night event this year. I don't really follow WWE anymore, but I do often take the time to at least watch Wrestlemania and the Royal Rumble every year, so I'll see if I can get myself a copy somehow.

### My stuff:

- [Still sketching](/albums/sketchbook/)! My favorite sketch for this week is of [Akira Kazama](/2021/04/1379656430081351687/), [upcoming fighter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IOdgfo7OaLI) in the Street Fighter V season 5 DLC.
- I [got my first dose of Sinovac vaccine today](/2021/04/first-sinovac-dose/)!
- **Watching:**
    - Continuing the James Bond run with [Diamonds are Forever (1971)](/2021/04/8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4/), Connery's last outing.
    - This week's **Falcon and Winter Soldier** was great, and those last 10 minutes were intense!
    - Other than that, just the usual weekly shows, etc.
- **Gaming**:
    - Saturday gaming group decided to pick up [Game of Thrones The Boardgame on Steam!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075190/A_Game_of_Thrones_The_Board_Game__Digital_Edition/) I've played this one IRL before, only once, but I didn't remember much. The digital version reminds me why: It's super complicated! Our first game took two hours, I didn't win. We didn't have time for a second one since I had to get up early for the vaccine appointment.
    - Fire Emblem: Three Houses still progressing very slowly.
    - This month's Humble Choice was revealed, and was meh for me, so I immediately paused.
    - I did get Days Gone via PS+ on PS4 though, I might actually play that one. Though they are also planning to give away Horizon Zero Dawn sometime this month, that might be a higher priority.
- **Books**: Finished reading Alexis Ohanian's [Without Their Permission](https://www.amazon.com/Without-Their-Permission-Century-Managed/dp/1455520020), will write a review soonish.
- Our trivia group posted a [new trivia video](/2021/04/1379623251479908354/#comments). Like and subscribe to the channel etc. It's mostly just us playing games and trivia, having fun.

### This coming week:

- new Falcon and Winter Soldier, Invincible, One Piece, etc
- Strixhaven drops on Magic Arena!
