### Movies

#### The Godfather (1972)

<time id="1350042544567029763">[2021-01-15 19:29] </time>

2021 movies no. 1: The Godfather (1972). Everyone is so young! Such a well-told gangster tale. Looking forward to the sequel

---

#### The Godfather Part II (1974)

<time id="1350361902149324800">[2021-01-16 16:39] </time>

2021 #movies no 2: The Godfather part 2 (1974). This is two movies rolled into one. Still pretty good, but I think I liked the singular focus of the first one more.

---

#### World War Z (2013)

<time id="1352137686614564867">[2021-01-21 14:15] </time>

2021 movie no. 3: World War Z (2013). Pretty typical action movie I think, entertaining enough. Should have watched at the start of the pandemic.

---

#### Space Sweepers (2021)

<time id="1363747640391860225">[2021-02-22 15:09] </time>

For some reason, I watched Space Sweepers, a Korean sci-fi movie on Netflix. Fun ride, fairly entertaining, pretty good setpieces and special effects. (They are so far ahead of the local film industry.) Plot a bit predictable. Villain made no sense.

---

#### Dr No (1962)

<time id="2b14f8356f57460da0a4790b27b44b8a">[2021-03-10 15:40] </time>

Haven't seen any of the pre-Brosnan Bond films, so I started today with Dr No (1962). Pretty good, but if this were a modern film, I'd have expected some kind of plot twist with Honey Rider, like maybe she would have turned out to be the actual Dr No

---

#### To Russia With Love (1963)

<time id="096b7c67797c165b01283d0c7cd6c016">[2021-03-11 17:14] </time>

James Bond movie no. 2: To Russia With Love (1963). This one actually had more bits that felt like actual espionage. And Bond didn't need to get captured this time!

#### Goldfinger (1964)

<time id="273eae12d668c24135d4db358511c9d4">[2021-03-15 17:54] </time>

Bond movie no. 3: Goldfinger (1964). Lot of the classic Bond tropes introduced. Bad guy's plan was actually pretty good, even had the escape contingency. Disappointed he did not have an actual gold finger. Great fight between Bond and Oddjob.

---

#### Thunderball (1965)

<time id="c6152994fa5ddf4b9c3302bcddfdd699">[2021-03-19 15:13] </time>

Bond movie no. 4: Thunderball (1965). This is the first one I didn't like very much. Too many boring/confusing underwater parts. There's a jetpack! Wasn't there an atomic bomb aboard that boat when it exploded? And did they just leave the guy who helped Domino escape floating alone in the ocean?

---

#### You Only Live Twice (1967)

<time id="fb71576d1974213ea471b5cda8a20948">[2021-03-24 16:01] </time>

Bond movie no. 5: You Only Live Twice (1967). Such Japan. Much wow. Cringe at trying to pass Bond off as Japanese. Introduction of secret volcano lair trope. Ninjas with guns! First screen appearance of the head of SPECTRE, inspiration for Dr Evil. 
<!--sep-->
That endgame scene of ninjas invading the secret volcano lair reminded me of the Simpsons episode _You Only Move Twice_. Bond's "wife" never named despite being only Bond girl to survive the movie.

---

#### On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969)

<time id="1a1ab3ad610478ba3b672b0a89c26333">[2021-04-04 14:56] </time>

Bond movie no. 6: On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969). Only Lazenby appearance. He was fine, I suppose. Tracy probably best Bond girl so far. I liked the ski scenes more than Thunderball's underwater scenes.
<!--sep-->
Loose continuity. Was confused by Blofeld not recognizing Bond after they already met in the previous movie. Apparently, the novel order was reversed. Also, did Bond just leave him stuck in a tree assuming he was dead after hunting him relentlessly?

---

#### Diamonds are Forever (1971)

<time id="8fd56682f77942eb0badef9444d465a4">[2021-04-09 20:19] </time>

Bond movie no. 7: Diamonds are Forever (1971). Connery's hair starting to go a bit gray in his last appearance. More Blofeld than I'd expected (harhar). Space laser! Plenty O'Toole seemed pointless, there just to die. A lot of cheesy lines from the assassin henchment.
<!--sep-->
These movies would be a lot shorter if they just shot Bond whenever they caught him. The action scenes in all these old Bond films always feel so jarring compared to modern ones. Limited by the technology of their time I guess.

---

#### Airplane (1980)

<time id="1381509474259673090">[2021-04-12 15:28] </time>

Needed something light to watch in the background, so I watched Airplane! (1980). It's the kind of movie where they just stuff in as many gags as possible, every throwaway line and even stuff happening in the background is a gag.

#### Live and Let Die (1973)

<time id="ced0a77eea2857ad31bd014fac3ded9a">[2021-04-15 18:05] </time>

Bond film no. 8: Live and Let Die (1973). 

Moore feels a lot more "generic white guy" than Connery was. Maybe I just need to get used to him. Young Jane Seymour is here! There's a bayou chase scene here that goes on just a bit too long and had superfluous cop characters. <!--sep-->All the voodoo stuff felt weirdly out of place. There's a character named Tee Hee! Most ridiculous villain death so far.

---

#### Rocky (1976)

<time id="b178a1efcfc005930f062c7be447d7c1">[2021-04-20 18:56] </time>

Today I decided to watch Rocky (1976) for some reason. The quintessential sports film, but I've never seen it before. Stallone looks only a bit younger than I remember him from the 90s. Apollo Creed is that dude from the Mandalorian! Surprised at the ending.

---

#### Green Hornet

<time id="3bf3bc036db88610a1c7b3474555eb69">[2021-04-29 15:26] </time>

Last night I accidentally watched most of the latter part of Green Hornet (2011) starring Seth Rogen. I never new he portrayed this character! Movie was reasonable popcorn action-comedy.

---

### TV

#### Invincible season 1

<time id="183ab94b6cb10f5db0431e715cde1945">[21:07]</time>

Invincible season 1 finale was pretty great, the fight was intense and afterwards I couldn't believe there was still half an episode to go. It's been a while since I read the books so I'm not sure, but I think they diverged a bit from the source material, but it's fine.<!--sep-->The series was developed well enough, decent pacing and enough to portray the major characters well. Looking forward to season 2!
