title: Weeknotes 2021-12-26 Season 2 Finale
---

This is the last weekend of the year, which means it marks another complete year of doing these weeknotes! I wrote [a short review at the end of last season](/2020/12/weeknotes-2020-12-27/) as well, and the same things still apply. It's nice that the blog has a weekly "heartbeat" post and it also gives future me a good insight as to what I was doing at a particular week in time. I've considered changing the frequency to be every two weeks or monthly to ease the need to be posting all the time, but I feel like that's too much time spent in between and I'm just liable to forget things.

This year I tried spicing up the weeknotes format by adding stuff like quotes, an "on this day" section (which I have yet to resume after [the whole Covid thing](/2021/10/covid-experience/) interrupted my regular format). I like this more structured format, but we'll see how it evolves next year!

### A Quote

> "If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality." - Desmond Tutu [(RIP)](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/desmond-tutu-anti-apartheid-campaigner-who-tried-to-heal-the-world-dies-at-90/ar-AAS9tGc)


### The World

- Covid cases in Metro Manila continue to stay low, though [OCTA research is seeing a slight uptick](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/12/24/OCTA-uptick-NCR-cases-holidays.html), possibly due to the holiday season. This means we still haven't been hit by an Omicron wave, which hopefully holds out.
- Yesterday, NASA launched the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/12/24/OCTA-uptick-NCR-cases-holidays.html)! The new mission, a joint effort with the European and Canadian space agencies, is a successor for the very old Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990. Unlike Hubble which is in Earth Orbit, the JWST will be travelling to a point around a million miles away from Earth, at [a Lagrange point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_point) between the Earth and the Sun. The more powerful telescope is expected to fuel scientific discoveries about the universe for decades to come!

### My Stuff

- Yesterday was Christmas Day of course. This time we managed to have an actual family celebration at home, though most of it was held outdoors in the garage area and everyone was masked. The nieces and nephews saw each other again for the first time in two years!
- We had the traditional [noche buena](/2021/12/1474388413281607683/) the day before Christmas.
- Still a bit behind on the [daily sketching](/albums/sketchbook/), though I did do some Christmas-themed doodles last night to catch up. Here's one of a fireplace:

- **Gaming**:
    - I finished [Blasphemous](https://store.steampowered.com/app/774361/Blasphemous/) yesterday! Still probably going to play it a bit this week to maybe get some achievements, but I am more or less done with the game I think. I expect to write a review this week.
    - Skipped the fighting games this past week. Card games still ongoing. Hit [Expedition Master in Eternal for the first time](/2021/12/1474317542785110017/). And currently trying to complete [the Decathlon events on Magic Arena](/2021/12/1472933987718815750/)!
    - Saturday gaming group still playing **Root** and newcomer **Fury of Dracula**. I tried playing as Dracula during this weekend's session, was terrible at it and got cornered and lost. At least I won two games of Root!

    - **Movies:** No movies watched this week!
    - **TV:**
