  "text": "<p>Watched Dune (2021). Only read the book in 2014, but I can hardly remember the plot except for the broad strokes. Movie is pretty good though; a reasonable adaptation of a supposedly \"unfilmable\" book. Arrakis is pretty close to how I imagined it in my head. <!--sep-->The sandworms look great. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Timothee Chalamet gave pretty good performances. Ending might be weird if you didn't know it was a two-parter going in. Looking forward to the next movie.</p>\n<p><time>[23:23]</time> Also a bit tempted to look for a copy of the 1984 Dune film lol. Maybe after the second part of this one comes out. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"pxgallery photos\">    \n\n\n\n<figure>\n    <a class=\"single_img\" href=\"http://192.168.254.170/blog/content\\notes\\2021\\11\\1b266589f886bed3ba7c7af21fe3a070\\1455193844903936005_1_FDHi6TXUYAscqzt.jpg\">\n        <img src=\"http://192.168.254.170/blog/cache/52/c6/52c617da492691406866c450a84f3285.jpg\" title=\"\" \n            data-pb-captionLink=''\n        /></a>\n<figcaption></figcaption></figure>\n\n</div>\n",
