#### Kate (2021)

<time id="f3cb16d7f21123133bc0506e9ddfc641">[2021-10-19 00:09] </time>

Watched Kate (2021). Straightforward John Wick-style action film, with a promise that the protag dies. Mary Elizabeth Winstead gives a fantastic performance. There's some great fight and camera work, and some great use of Tokyo as the backdrop for the movie.

#### Dune (2021)

<time id="1b266589f886bed3ba7c7af21fe3a070">[2021-11-01 23:20] </time>

Watched Dune (2021). Only read the book in 2014, but I can hardly remember the plot except for the broad strokes. Movie is pretty good though; a reasonable adaptation of a supposedly "unfilmable" book. Arrakis is pretty close to how I imagined it in my head. <!--sep-->The sandworms look great. Oscar Isaac, Rebecca Ferguson, and Timothee Chalamet gave pretty good performances. Ending might be weird if you didn't know it was a two-parter going in. Looking forward to the next movie.

<time>[23:23]</time> Also a bit tempted to look for a copy of the 1984 Dune film lol. Maybe after the second part of this one comes out.

#### Blade Runner 2049 (2017)

<time id="4737c6da7ee142af8b00576b407172a2">[2021-11-10 20:25] </time>

Watched Blade Runner 2049 (2017), mostly because I had recently watched Dune (2021) and wanted to see more Denis Villeneuve. Was not disappointed. Fantastic visual design and cinematography. <!--sep--> Lots of familiar actors showed up! Harrison Ford only appeared halfway through. I liked the reveal of how what the movie was telegraphing all along was a fake.

<time>[2021-11-11 09:31]</time> I actually don't remember when I watched the original (probably only within the past 10y or so; I never saw it during the time it came out) and don't recall most of the plot, but I feel like this one was much easier to follow. Maybe because I had subtitles!

#### Red Notice (2021)

<time id="0e58384d44cdcdeb9242e84bf1bfc460">[2021-11-16 01:06] </time>

Sat through Red Notice (2021) a couple of times while other people were watching. Can't say I saw all of it, but certainly the entire second half at least. It had some fun moments, but the "twists" were predictable and I found the ending disappointing.

#### Venom: Let There Be Carnage Spoiler-Free Review

<time id="56dd95663d98892bbe89d56ab0b96887">[2021-12-14 02:05] </time>

- Straightforward superhero film, not particularly exceptional or clever or funny or anything, it's just there. 
- Surprisingly short runtime, around 1:40. Plot proceeds briskly with very little cruft.
<!--sep-->
- They leaned into the "odd couple" trope which isn't a thing in the comics. 
- Pleasantly surprised that Shriek is played by Naomie Harris (Moneypenny!). 
- There is a post-credits scene.

#### The Last Duel (2021)

<time id="6a6736de7e1db5688bb8a6bc15b9e023">[2021-12-15 05:44] </time>

- Pretty good film, great performances all around. 
- a bit like a slice of life for for minor lords in medieval France
- TW: Rape, misogyny, blood and gore, etc
- Surprisingly based on a true story!

#### Heat (1995)

<time id="c65caaf1deb0e34faaddb3451ac0cdd8">[2021-12-19 21:24] </time>

I have a bit of face blindness when it comes to Pacino and De Niro, I always need a second to figure out which is which when they're together. Great performances here and it's a pretty good crime film, with a lot of big names (very young Natalie Portman!)

#### The Green Knight (2021)

<time id="82b6c9fc2e334e6f86afda915c9dd1f3">[2021-12-27 01:00] </time>

Watched The Green Knight (2021). Wasn't sure what to expect. Description suggested it would be some kind of action movie. It was most certainly not. The movie is captivating, unsettling, ambiguous, and even kind of trippy. <!--sep-->Some great shots and visuals. Also it is surprisingly a Christmas movie. And there is a short post-credits scene!
