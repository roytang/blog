Finished the current Doctor Who: Flux series yesterday. It was a bit meh and loosely plotted, but I kinda enjoyed it. Chibnall definitely won't be missed though.

The season seemed to mostly revolve around trying to dig out of the Timeless Child background set up in the previous season while at the same time squeezing out a last chance to use classic Who villains: Sontarans, Daleks, Weeping Angels etc. 

Also: So many companions! Anyway, apparently Jodie is getting a few more specials next year with Chibnall before they turn the reins back to RTD. I wish Jodie had gotten a chance with another (probably better) showrunner, but alas.
