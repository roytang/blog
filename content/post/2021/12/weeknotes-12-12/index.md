### A Quote

> Be curious. Read widely. Try new things. I think a lot of what people call intelligence just boils down to curiosity. -- [Aaron Schwartz](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2013/01/aaron-swartz-reader-in-his-own-words.html)

### Another Quote

> 
> - Refusing to set aside trivial preferences;

### The World

- The Omicron variant has been detected and case counts are rising in many places all over the world, but surprisingly not yet in the PH. Our case counts and positivity rates also still remain comfortably low, so that's good. Hopefully our situation holds. (And the other countries improve of course.)
- The courts have allowed Maria Ressa to travel to Oslo and [she has already received her Nobel Peace Prize](https://www.dw.com/en/nobel-peace-prize-maria-ressa-and-dmitry-muratov-receive-award/a-60081458).
- Looks like [some number of BDO accounts have been hacked recently](https://mb.com.ph/2021/12/11/hacked-bdo-accounts-are-used-to-buy-bitcoin-via-unionbank/). I've already checked recent transactions on my accounts and changed passwords.

### My Stuff

- Some more family / medical errands this week, most notably: I got my parents a Moderna booster shot last Thursday (c/o my sister-in-law making the arrangements). They didn't even feel any side effects other than some mild soreness! Life is unfair. (Not that I wanted them to get side effects!)
- Surprisingly, have been sleeping at better hours than the past weeks. Still no continuous 7/8 hour sleeps for me, but at least I can predict now when I'll be asleep or awake. Hope it lasts. Or improves even!
- I caught up with the [daily sketching](/albums/sketchbook/), then promptly fell behind again by a day. Here's a sketch of a little kid that I drew from a real-life photo:

- **Gaming**:
    - **Tales of Symphonia:** Already beaten the game once, still grinding out some extra achievements before putting it to rest.
    - Still struggling to climb the ranks in my regular fighting games: **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V** and the regular card games: **Eternal** and **Magic Arena**
        - tried out the Alchemy game mode on Arena for a bit; nothing too egregious, but the game client now feels super slow and sluggish because I think they inadvertently slowed down card animations.
    - Saturday gaming group picked up a new boardgame-to-digital conversion this weekend in [Fury of Dracula on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/958530/Fury_of_Dracula_Digital_Edition/). Was reasonably easy to learn. We beat AI Dracula in the first game!
- **Watching:**
    - **Movies:** Still none this week! I'm hoping to watch more movies in the last couple of weeks of the year to up my count.
    - **TV:** 
        - [Finished the current season of **Doctor Who**](/2021/12/2c719acc6b88173b3abe47cc18a632c0/). A bit meh and loosely plotted, but I kinda enjoyed it. 
        - Other ongoings are **Star Trek Discovery**, **Hawkeye**, **Wheel of Time**, **Flash**, etc. Still behind on most of these shows!
- **Reading:** Still reading **Sapiens** by Yuval Noah Harari, more than halfway through the book. Will likely be my last book of the year.
- **Trivia**: We had another online quiz night last Friday, probably the last one for the year. Sadly, we did not do well.

### This coming week:

- Second season of **The Witcher** drops!
- Oh, apparently I missed it but the final season of **The Expanse** already started last week; looking forward to starting this as well.
