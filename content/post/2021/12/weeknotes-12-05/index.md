title: Weeknotes 2021-12-05 Booster Packed!
---

Been a bit busy (see below), so no links or commentary on world news today. Full format again next week. Probably. Maybe.

### My stuff:

- Due to a conflux of circumstances I had an unproductive week:
    - Tuesday: should have been a chill holiday, but [our internet was out for most of the day](/2021/11/1465467309753913357/)
    - Wednesday: Ran some errands, then decided on the fly to [go get my booster shot on that same day](/2021/12/583117f34d16e020cfe376aa71f78c4a/), which took an unexpectedly large chunk of my day.
    - Thursday and Friday: Suffering from booster side effects. High temps for most of Thursday, body feeling heavy through Friday. Slept a lot both days. I think my arm soreness at the injection site only went away Saturday. 
    - Today, Sunday: Some visits meant time was spent entertaining houseguests.
- IDK if it's because I got so much sleep the last few days, but my sleep has gone back to being quite broken. [This is not an unusual state](/2019/08/out-of-sync-with-the-world/), but today seems to be on the worse end I couldn't sleep at all last night until after breakfast time and even then my sleep was spotty because I kept getting woken up to attend to some family things. I have less than four hours sleep so far since yesterday.
- And yes despite my best efforts I'm still behind on my [daily sketching](/albums/sketchbook/). Here's a sketch of 2B from *Nier Automata*, a game I have never played:

- **Gaming**:
    - **Tales of Symphonia** is at that point in a JRPG right before the final boss but then you have to chance to go back and do optional stuff. I'm taking my time to grind a bit to beat some optional bosses; since I may never bother with additional completion runs for this game, I want to do beat them now. So this may take another week or so to finish I guess.
    - Still struggling to climb the ranks in my regular fighting games: **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**.
    - Still doing my daily games of **Eternal**
    - This weekend was the [Crimson Vow](/tags/mtgcrimson/) Draft Open on **Magic Arena**! I've been prepping for this for a while, but sadly I [did not do well](/2021/12/mtgcrimson-limited-recap/#arena-open).
    - I purchased the RPGs in my Steam Cart! Maybe someday I even get to play them!
- **Watching:**
    - **Movies:** Didn't watch any this week! There are a bunch I want to watch though, just haven't found the time, energy or the continuous block of TV access to do so.
    - **TV:** Ongoings are **Star Trek Discovery**, **Hawkeye**, **Wheel of Time**, **Doctor Who**, **Flash**, etc. Still behind on most of these shows!
- **Reading:** Still reading **Sapiens** by Yuval Noah Harari, although I didn't have the energy to for most of the week.
- **Trivia**: The regular crosswords continue. 
- **Misc**: My bathroom light has finally been fixed. It's been weeks! It seems yellower than I remember.

### This coming week:

- Magic Arena is getting a new live digital format this week called Alchemy, with new cards dropping and some paper cards being rebalanced! There has been a louder-than-usual outcry from the usual crowd that don't like things diverging from paper Magic, but I'm cautiously optimistic for it. 
- We have a quiz night again this coming Friday!
