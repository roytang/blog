### Limited Set Notes

- win rate goes down significantly for decks with splash color(s)
- by Main Color:
    - winningest for me was UB, by a clear margin. This was the exploit archetype, which I do remember enjoying a lot.
    - BW (Lifegain) had the most number of events, most probably due to always being tempted by removal. It was however, my second-worst performing archetype. Worst archetype was RG (Werewolves) by a fair margin.
    - color pairs / archetypes I never got to try out were BG and UR
- by Color:
    - unsurprisingly reinforcing the above observations: Blue and Black had the highest win rates. Green easily the worst.
- by Format:
    - my one Sealed event was pretty good, but low sample size, etc etc
    - Premier Draft still most played, which probably explains 
    - I had two Arena Open runs, but this was my worst format by far
- by Ranks:
    - I did well in Gold, but much worse in Platinum.
- Quick/Premier Drafts by Outcome:
    - I think this was a decent amount of 7s and 6s, but we still had a 0
- Overall:
    - I played 21 events for 137 games total with a 58.39% win rate

Not a lot of insights, mostly because I'm doing this post from the future and not a lot of it is fresh for me.

### 7-x Drafts

### Arena Open

<time>[Sun, Dec. 5, 2021, 3:23 a.m.]</time> Have thrown away some gems at yet another #ArenaOpen on #MagicArena. All that draft practice did NOT pay off. Both decks felt meh. Watch the VODs for examples of how not to draft #MtgCrimson apparently

### Magic Arena Stats

<time>[Sat, Feb. 19, 2022, 5:25 a.m.]</time> New #MagicArena stats email dropped! 

Sadly it looks like they have really discontinued the most drafted commons/uncommons bit from the old versions.

I played so much VOW @_@ 789 games and 177 boosters is a record! 

{{< photos 1494785134578454528 >}}

<time>[05:25]</time> Looks like around 100k gold per season is typical, which makes those events that cost 25k gold entry seem so much more ridiculous.

This is the first of these where my favorite format isn't traditional constructed. I really should compile my draft stats sometime.
