Notes:

- win rate goes down significantly for decks with splash color(s)
- by Main Color:
    - winningest for me was UB, by a clear margin. This was the exploit archetype, which I do remember enjoying a lot.
    - BW (Lifegain) had the most number of events, most probably due to always being tempted by removal. It was however, my second-worst performing archetype. Worst archetype was RG (Werewolves) by a fair margin.
    - color pairs / archetypes I never got to try out were BG and UR
- by Color:
    - unsurprisingly reinforcing the above observations: Blue and Black had the highest win rates. Green easily the worst.
- by Format:
    - my one Sealed event was pretty good, but low sample size, etc etc
    - Premier Draft still most played, which probably explains 
    - I had two Arena Open runs, but this was my worst format by far
- by Ranks:
    - I did well in Gold, but much worse in Platinum.
- Quick/Premier Drafts by Outcome:
    - I think this was a decent amount of 7s and 6s, but we still had a 0
- Overall:
    - I played 21 events for 137 games total with a 58.39% win rate

Not a lot of insights, mostly because I'm doing this post from the future and not a lot of it is fresh for me.
