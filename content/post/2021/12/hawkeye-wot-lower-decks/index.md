### Hawkeye

Hawkeye was fine. It was less about Clint Barton and more about introducing Kate Bishop and seeing the aftermath of Natasha's death in Endgame. Ending was kind of so-so. There is one post-credits scene at the end of the last episode, it's fun.

{{< spoiler >}}
  
- High point is Yelena's appearance in episodes 4 and 5 and interactions with Kate. New Hawkeye and new Bishop vibing!
- Not really feeling Maya / Echo, not sure why they decided to give her a standalone series.
- I don't understand introducing Kingpin (with virtually no background for anyone who hasn't seen Netflix Daredevil) then pretending to kill him after just one episode and one mediocre fight (don't pretend that fight was any better than the one at the end of Daredevil season 3!)
- I *DO* understand potentially introducing Laura Barton as formerly Agent 19 / Mockingbird (as implied by the watch), although Agents of SHIELD might be sad.

### Wheel of Time

Wheel of Time: The plot of season 1 follows the plot of [the first book](/2019/05/wheel-of-time-eye-of-the-world/) very, very loosely and diverges a lot by the final episode. I mostly enjoyed the season, and I can understand why they would choose to diverge from the books, though I will admit some of the decisions especially in the final season might seem... questionable. Some liberties necessarily had to be taken, given the sheer amount of content in the books that need to be compressed into a TV series, but diverging so much, was it really necessary? We'll have to wait and see I suppose.

Rosamund Pike gives a good performance as Moiraine, but the kids could stand some improvement. I liked the portrayal of Loial. Visuals and effects and set pieces were ok; I kind of liked how the use of the One Power is portrayed, as I would have thought it difficult to portray in the first place.

Notable absences were the Trakands (I guess it didn't make sense to introduce possible new love interests for Rand and Egwene given how they used the Two Rivers relationship later on) and Elyas (meaning Perrin had very little of relevance to do this season). Also, apparently the actor for Mat Cauthon quit at the end of this season, which possibly explains the bizarre decision to cut him out of the last third of the season.

{{< /spoiler >}}

The series does make me want to continue my re-read of the books which didn't go beyond the first book in 2019. I suppose I could try to at least get through the next two books next year before the next season comes around.

### Star Trek: Lower Decks

I finished watching season 2 of this last week, and apparently I never wrote about season 1. It's a pretty good, wacky, light-hearted look at the Star Trek universe, good enough for background watching. Just glad it's still on Prime Video instead of taken of in favor of Paramount+ like what happened with Discovery.
