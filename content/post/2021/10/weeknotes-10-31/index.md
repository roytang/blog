It's the last day of October. And Halloween, I guess. If that means something to you.

### The world:

- Local politics still depresses me. Let's not talk about it today.
- On the upside, local Covid numbers are getting better, hopefully a trend that continues through Christmas. We're actually [starting to inch closer and closer to the recommended 5% positivity rate](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1454357622438518784)! Though we'll see how the lowering of alert levels affects the numbers in the coming week.
- Big news in the tech world this week is how [Facebook has rebranded as "Meta"](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/facebook-rebrands-company-as-meta-in-focus-on-metaverse/ar-AAQ2Uzx), which is personally a bit "meh" for me. I mean, they're still terrible for humanity in general.

### My stuff:

- I wrote [quite a few words about our Covid hospital stay](/2021/10/covid-experience/). And then [a little bit more](/2021/10/little-things-add-up/). Hopefully I can move on now.
- Still [sketching daily](/albums/sketchbook/), and in fact I managed to maintain the streak all week! I should finish the [Inktober 2021](/tags/inktober2021/) set by today as well. Here's the All-Spark:

- **Watching:**
    - Actually haven't watched much of anything this week. I'm halfway through **Dune (2021)**, will probably try to get through the rest of it this week. Started watching the new season of **The Simpsons**, something I still keep up out of habit. Actually also started watching **Saturday Night Live** eps as background watching.
- **Gaming**:
    - The regular fare:
        - **Great Ace Attorney Chronicles** and **Tales of Symphonia**, both ongoing and hoping I can finish them this year.
        - Daily fighting games ongoing on weeknights: **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**! 
        - My daily card games: **Eternal** and **Magic Arena**. Been having trouble grinding in Eternal, but I did manage [to hit mythic on Arena just in the nick of time](/2021/10/1454654931336527883/)!
        - A little bit of **Super Metroid** here and there.
    - Streaming [Innistrad Midnight Hunt limited](/tags/mtgmidnight) is done. This week, previews for the next set, **Innistrad: Crimson Vow**. have kicked off.
- **Reading**: Still reading **The Conjugal Dictatorship** by Primitivo Mijares. Slow and steady; I suspect I can finish it this week, if not the next.
- Trivia team: still bereft of quiz nights, we are just enjoying crosswords on the regular.

### This coming week:

- I believe **Eternals** is coming out this week, but since we still don't have cinemas (or maybe we do and I'm not willing to go), it may be a while before I can watch it. Might be able to see **Shang Chi** in a couple of weeks though!
