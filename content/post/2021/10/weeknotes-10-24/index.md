It's been about a month since a full-blown weeknotes. Let's catch up on things!

### The world:

- PH's 2022 presidential race is in high gear; the deadline for filing of candidacy has passed, but there's still the substitution deadline on Nov 15, so there's still maneuverings going on, with [the scions of darkness meeting up for negotiations in Cebu yesterday](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1505713/beautiful-coincidence-bongbong-sara-meet-in-cebu). Meanwhile, the [main opposition candidate is preaching kindness](/2021/10/1451030052166979584/), even as the liberals and the left are kind of squabbling over details and who is supporting who and who is worthy of support and whatnot. The good guys need to get their act together, and not be [the dumb side](/2021/10/1449691610346766342/) this time around.
- The IATF lowered NCR's quarantine alert level to 3, which means more people on the streets. [Cases are trending down](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/10/22/2135976/average-new-covid-19-cases-reproduction-rate-down-ncr-octa), and even the positivity rate is going down, so that's good. 
- Alert level 3 means cinemas can reopen again, and I'm actually tempted to go for it so I can watch **Shang Chi** and **No Time to Die** in the theaters, but this seems like a terrible idea.
- Not sure what's going on with the rest of the world. I don't think there's been anything too major over the past few weeks? [Global supply chain issues](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/18/supply-chain-chaos-is-hitting-global-growth-and-could-get-worse.html). [Trump started a social media site based on a Mastodon fork, but apparently they aren't complying with the open source license](https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dgm5k/truth-social-is-mastodon-trump). [Facebook under fire for the usual things](https://www.npr.org/2021/10/11/1045067338/facebook-under-fire-the-whistleblower-the-outage-and-the-future), there's a whistleblower and everything. [Dave Chapelle being unsurprisingly controversial but Netflix backing him anyway](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/dave-chappelle-netflix-employees-walkout/). [Alec Baldwin shot someone on set](https://nypost.com/2021/10/22/one-shot-fired-by-alec-baldwin-tore-through-two-people-on-movie-set/). Did I miss anything?

### Links of interest:

I have been sharing links via the [links page](/links) but I also have a bunch of saved links I haven't had time to read yet and a backlog of sources to read through. Sigh. 

- Drew DeVault writes about how [software developers don't care about reliability](https://drewdevault.com/2021/10/17/Reliability.html).
- Mark Manson reminds us that [we are what we consume](https://markmanson.net/newsletters/mindfck-monthly-93).
- Gordon Brander has a multi-part series on what's next for the web. The last part is about [building new web-like things](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/weblike-things), but you can click through to the other parts, they're good reads too.
- Clive Thompson talks about [rewilding your attention](https://uxdesign.cc/rewilding-your-attention-d518ede18855) (Warning: Medium) by stepping away from big tech's recommendation algorithms. 
- Louis Barclay wrote a tool to help people unfollow everyone on Facebook; in response, [Facebook banned him for life](https://slate.com/technology/2021/10/facebook-unfollow-everything-cease-desist.html).

### My stuff:

- As I've mentioned, I was in the hospital for around 3 weeks starting the last weekend of September; I will probably write more about it this week.
- I fell behind on the [sketching daily](/albums/sketchbook/) during the first couple of weeks in the hospital, but I managed to catch up once I had more time and energy. Here's Bucky the Cat from Get Fuzzy:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: While we did have a TV during the hospital stay, I left control of it up to my dad, and we saw repeated runs of James Bond films. The only new movie I've seen during the past month or so was [Kate](https://roytang.net/2021/10/f3cb16d7f21123133bc0506e9ddfc641/) on Netflix.
    - TV: 
        - Actually managed to watch the season finales for **What If** and **Ted Lasso S2** during the hospital stay. 
            - **What If**: I'm glad that they actually made a finale where the previous episodes meant something, but the premise was kind of whack
            - **Ted Lasso S2**: The season went in a direction I wasn't expecting, but I'm glad the finale made the sports part relevant again. Looking forward to season 3!
        - Now that I'm back home, I've started watching **Young Justice Season 4** and the new season of **NCIS**, and also catching up on **Supergirl**
- **Gaming**:
    - During the hospital stay, I could only play whatever games I had already installed on Steam on my Macbook Air. I ended up achievement hunting in **Slay the Spire** whenever I had free time. 
    - Now that I'm back home, I've resumed my regular fare:
        - Still playing the second game of **Great Ace Attorney Chronicles** and **Tales of Symphonia**. Discussion with friends made me realize I've only [finished 3 games so far this year](/lists/media/games/2021/), so hopefully I can finish these two soonish as well.
        - Daily fighting games ongoing on weeknights: **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**! 
    - Also started playing **Super Metroid** via the SNES emulator on the Switch; This is to stave off wanting to buy **Metroid Dread**, but we'll see if I can keep it up while playing all these other games too.
    - Also trying to get back into streaming [Innistrad Midnight Hunt limited](/tags/mtgmidnight) on Arena; I managed [one draft this week](/2021/09/1440639122591268864/), it went better than I thought it would.
    - Playing **Eternal** and **Magic Arena** again of course, though hitting master/mythic rank this month seems unlikely given how much time I've lost.
- **Reading**: In anticipation of the upcoming PH election season, I decided to start reading **The Conjugal Dictatorship** by Primitivo Mijares. The book is challenging to read; the author is verbose and tends towards flowery prose, but at the same time each chapter is dense with information; people, places and events leading up to and during Marcos' martial law gambit. A copy of this book is [freely available online](http://rizalls.lib.admu.edu.ph:8080/ebooks2/Primitivo%20Mijares.pdf), if that's your thing.
- We actually had an online quiz night last Friday, themed around spooky monsters (zombies, vampires, etc). We didn't do well, but we had fun and it's been a while since we've had an actual quiz night.
- Before I got stuck in the hospital, I actually decided to pay for a year's sub to the New York Times games, which gives me access to their crossword and the archives, among others. This is mostly for the trivia team's entertainment and I decided to pay for it because the guy who was streaming the crosswords to us over Discord had terrible internet and we kept having trouble with his streams. Maybe I'll also do a chill crossword stream over Twitch one of these days.

### This coming week:

Last week of October! I really just want to get back into all my routines and clear my backlogs and do all the tasks on my personal to-do list and to not have to worry about everything.
