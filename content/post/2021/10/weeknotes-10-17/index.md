title: Weeknotes 2021-10-17 There And Back Again
---

As of tonight, all of the household's Covid patients have been cleared and sent home from the hospital. I wish I could say that was the end of the ordeal, but not everyone came back at full strength and there may still be a significant recovery period to go. What this means for me personally is that my caretaking days are not yet done.

I thought I would have the energy for a full-blown weeknotes today, but with everything I've had to handle, it might take me a few more days to get back into my familiar old routines and rhythms, but we'll get there eventually. At the very least, there will certainly be a lot to write about in the coming days.
