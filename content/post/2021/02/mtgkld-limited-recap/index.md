Notes:

- Kalhdeim was a fun limited format (mostly because splashing was easy), but my win rates were pretty bad, mostly because of Sealed
- I had played some extra sealeds late in the season to prep for the Sealed Arena Open, where I did not make day 2
- there were 2 premier drafts where I knew the decks but didn't have the actual results. My notes only said ["they had terrible outcomes"](/2021/02/1362353266387021827/), so I logged them as 1-3.
- as I go further back in time with these back-dated limited recaps, the notes are only going to get sparser
