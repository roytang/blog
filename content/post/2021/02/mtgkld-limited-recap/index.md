### Preview Season

<time>[Fri, Jan. 8, 2021, 7:47 p.m.]</time> I have yet to see any Valki Vartokamus jokes and I am disappointed in all of you #mtg #MTGKaldheim

Geez, god/planeswalker MDFC. At first glance it seems really solid. Valki is good early, Tibalt gives you late game utility.

### Limited Notes

- Kalhdeim was a fun limited format (mostly because splashing was easy), but my win rates were pretty bad, mostly because of Sealed
- I had played some extra sealeds late in the season to prep for the Sealed Arena Open, where I did not make day 2
- there were 2 premier drafts where I knew the decks but didn't have the actual results. My notes only said "they had terrible outcomes", so I logged them as 1-3.
- as I go further back in time with these back-dated limited recaps, the notes are only going to get sparser

### 7-x Drafts

### Arena Open

<time>[Sun, Feb. 21, 2021, 3:15 p.m.]</time> To finish my run at #Kaldheim limited, I decided to yolo some gems away at the Sealed Arena Open! Here's the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyjl8Rzdga4

### Magic Arena Stats

<time>[Fri, April 16, 2021, 6:45 a.m.]</time> I got my #MagicArena stats for #mtgkhm! Pretty sure I was picking Priest of the Haunted Edge too highly. Also for some reason the last time I got one of these emails was for Theros Beyond Death one year ago. #MTGArenaStats
