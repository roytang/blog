title: The Annual Globe Outage
---

Globe fiber's been down in the house since yesterday afternoon. On the bright side, I managed to finish a book and a game yesterday. Reading and playing, not writing and making, unfortunately.

<time>[07:15]</time> It's Ash Wednesday, so I guess it's a bit of penitensya for me =/

<time>[20:28]</time> Globe internet outage in tandang sora area into its 28th hour so far. [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) hasnt replied to me DMs in 10hrs. Internet service is crucial during the pandemic, so more responsive customer service would be nice

<time>[20:30]</time> There are so many ways Globe's customer service could be improved and/or streamlined. I am already composing a blog post in my head lol

<time id="1362173871806287872">[2021-02-18 06:55] </time> Posting publicly for the benefit of other Globe subscribers in Tandang Sora:. [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) seems like 36h (and counting) should be more than enough time to at least give us a estimated timeframe of when we can expect a fix. Is it possibly within the day? Week? Month?

Give us some idea so we can plan accordingly, especially for those who need this connection for work or school

Almost an hour after I posted this, our internet service has apparently been restored. I hope my fellow tandang sora globe subscribers have recovered as well

<time id="1362189435815698433">[2021-02-18 07:57] </time> Our internet service has thankfully been restored, now I no longer have any excuse for not being productive.

I am once again living in a society
