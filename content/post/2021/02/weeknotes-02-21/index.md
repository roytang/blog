Last week of February is about to start. Time flies, as they say.

### The world:
- Texas (and other parts of the southern US I guess) have been hit by heavy winter storms, with accompanying power grid failures and such. We have some relatives there so it's a concern. Meanwhile, their governor falsely blames renewables for the power problems and their senator went to Cancun.
- [Facebook cut off Australian news links](https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-calls-australias-bluff). I think both sides of these are dumb, but that is the big tech controversy of the week.
- NASA has landed [the Perseverance rover on Mars!](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/)
- Unsurprisingly, we still do not have vaccines in this country.
  
### Links of interest:

- [Why Generation X Will Save the Web](https://webdevlaw.uk/2021/01/30/why-generation-x-will-save-the-web/). I'm generation X! I think?
- Sci-fi author John Scalzi shares [some thoughts on "being cancelled"](https://whatever.scalzi.com/2021/02/13/general-unstructured-thoughts-on-being-cancelled/?amp=1)
- In regards to front-end web development: [The web didn't change; you did.](https://remysharp.com/2021/02/11/the-web-didnt-change-you-did)
- [The Big List of Personal Websites](http://biglist.terraaeon.com/index.html). A lot of blogs to browse!
- Noah Smith shares some [sci-fi novel recommendations](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/my-sci-fi-novel-recommendations). Saving to go through later to add to my perennially-behind-book-backlog.

### My stuff:

- Have a bunch of family and medical stuff to do this coming week, so I don't expect to be very productive.
- We had a [Globe fiber internet outage](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1362173871806287872/) last week, starting Tuesday afternoon until Thursday morning. So I spent all of Ash Wednesday without internet, which is appropriate as a bit of *penitencia* I guess. Spent the downtime complaining at their customer support account, and also reading and playing offline things. I thought about writing a post about their customer service, but it was an actual outage that affected a bunch of people in the area, and the customer service can't really do much about that, so it seems a bit mean to pile on now that the service has been restored (and I seem to have gotten a rebate for the lost days). Maybe I'll still write the post, we'll see.
- [Still sketching](/albums/sketchbook/).
- **Watching:**
    - Caught up with B99 up to season 7. Looks like the final season might not come out until 2022 though.
    - I went ahead and finished The Expanse season 5 yesterday. Overall the season wasn't as exciting as some of the earlier ones, but still pretty good.
    - **WandaVision** ended on another cliffhanger this week as usual, and it wasn't a big surprise for me, given everyone on reddit had been predicting it. Two eps to go, hoping for a strong finish!
- **Gaming:**
    - I played a lot of [Kaldheim limited this week](/tags/Kaldheim), drafts at first as usual, then I did some sealeds to prep for the Arena Open, which I also did as the [season finale](https://roytang.net/2021/02/1363386731240726533/) for the [Kaldheim limited youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmU0vkKslGXgza5YFq3PfZZGHwyRIYYU-). I enjoyed this format, though I wasn't super good at it (mostly my fault, since I didn't really read up on pick orders and such early on). It's fun and challenging. Looking forward to Strixhaven!
    - Thanks to our internet outage, I finished [Knightin'](https://store.steampowered.com/app/922710/Knightin/)! There's a couple of achievements I haven't gotten which I'm not sure if I'll bother - they're for doing a speedrun and a no-death run, both of which I can probably do with a bit of practice, but not sure it's worth it. I did like the game though, I might write a short review this week.
    - Second Fire Emblem Three Houses run still in progress.
- **Books:** Thanks to our internet outage, I finished reading [Cory Doctorow's "Walkaway"](/2021/02/walkaway/). Also started reading [Scott Berkun's Ghost of my Father](https://scottberkun.com/the-ghost-of-my-father/), which turned out to be a quick read, will probably finish it tonight or tomorrow.
