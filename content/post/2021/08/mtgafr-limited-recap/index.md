Notes:

- by Main Color:
    - Winningest archetypes were BW and UB, but low sample size (1 event each), while BR was the most played with 6 events and win rate closer to my average
    - I wasn't able to try BG or GW
- by Color: Black was the winningest color, followed by Red, which I think follows the general consensus around AFR
- By Format: as is typical, I did poorly in the bigger prize event

Not a lot of insights, mostly because I'm doing this post from the future and not a lot of it is fresh for me.
