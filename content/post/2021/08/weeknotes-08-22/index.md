### A quote:

> "And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who don’t believe in magic will never find it." -- Roald Dahl

(via [swiss-miss](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2021/08/watch-with-glittering-eyes.html))

### The world:

- We hit [record-breaking case numbers](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1428628534327717889) and death rates towards the end of the 15-day ECQ period. In spite of this, the IATF in their wisdom has decided to loosen our quarantine level to ["MECQ"](https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1428594948010479617). People note that the described restrictions in this flavor of MECQ are mostly the same as with the just-ended ECQ, except the supposedly lesser quarantine level is an excuse to no longer hand out any ayuda.
- In spite of the current covid surge, our erstwhile president chose to spend his precious time [affirming his bromance with the embattled DOH secretary](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/08/21/2121650/even-if-i-stand-alone-duterte-says-hell-stand-duque-amid-coa-findings).
- Philippine boxing legend and part-time senator Manny Pacquiao lost his match against Yordenis Ugas earlier today. He should take it as a hint and retire from the sport, like he promised when he ran for the senate (See below). Then maybe consider retiring from politics too.

- Dominating the international news this week: The [botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/16/politics/biden-afghanistan-speech/index.html), the Taliban promising to respect women's rights and the rights of those evacuating the country and almost immediately breaking those promises.

### Links of interest:

Looks like I have mostly twitter stuff this week:

- Developer stuff: A [twitter thread on why try-catch exception handling is terrible](https://twitter.com/badamczewski01/status/1427248857197514754).
- Gamedev stuff: A couple of twitter threads about Skyrim that demonstrate how complicated gamedev is:
    - [thread about the infamous cart intro sequence](https://twitter.com/NPurkeypile/status/1427650365558857728)
    - [thread about the myth of the treasure fox](https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008041887281157)
- Chess stuff: A [twitter thread about the Immortal Zugzwang Game](https://twitter.com/rasmansa/status/1427271130382049284)
- Future dystopia stuff: Tesla announced [they are developing a humanoid robot](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/elon-musk-teases-tesla-bot-humanoid-robot-for-repetitive-tasks.html) based on their self-driving technology. This sort of thing is probably a long ways off, but that prototype model they're showing gives off a strong "automated storm trooper" vibe for me.
- Personal website stuff: I've been really enjoying browsing through [the blogroll at maya.land](https://maya.land/blogroll.opml)

### From the archives, this week in history:

- 2017: The [murder of Kian delos Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_of_Kian_delos_Santos,_Carl_Arnaiz_and_Reynaldo_de_Guzman), the most famous victim of Duterte's drug war
- 2012: [Interior secretary Jesse Robredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Robredo), husband of the current Vice President, dies in a plane crash off Masbate Island
- 2009: I [went to Bangkok](/2009/08/grand-prix-bangkok/)! It was my first non-work overseas trip.
- 2008: I [created my Twitter account](/2008/08/889930055/)! 

  
### My stuff:

- Still [sketching daily](/albums/sketchbook/); Surprisingly I am not behind today. Here's one I did yesterday of Spider-Woman; it's a bit messy and I got too lazy to do any touchups or backgrounds or whatever, but I kind of like how it turned out:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: Only watched **Jumanji: The Next Level** during this week's Saturday gaming session. Will include this in the next set of reviews.
    - TV: Finished the **Parks and Recreation** rewatch! Such a great series. Started a rewatch of **House**, another great series. Second episode of **What If** was better than the first. Second pair of **Brookyln Nine-Nine** episodes were ok. **Superman and Lois** wrapped up their first season.
- **Gaming**:
    - On PS4: Played a bit of the **Tales of Arise** demo. My PS4 was acting up so I didn't get too far into it, but so far it's pretty much what I'd expect from a Tales game.
    - Still running through **Great Ace Attorney Chronicles**, now in the last case of GAA1 I believe.
    - Daily fighting games ongoing on weeknights: still **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**. I unlocked DLC character Akira with Fight Money in SFV, but haven't used her online yet as I was having a decent run with Birdie and didn't want to break it.
    - **Magic Arena:** Mostly durdling around. The queues and metagames are a bit stale/boring at the moment, hopefully this week's new releases shake things up.
- **Reading**: Finished up the stack of comic book collections I was reading, [wrote some words about them](/2021/08/stack-of-comics/). Found a copy of Ursula K LeGuin's *Left Hand of Darkness* for my Kindle app, so will probably go back to "real" books this week.
- No quiz night this past week (well, there was one, but we didn't like the categories so we skipped.) Just the usual crosswords and such.

### This coming week:

- Some MTG stuff this week!
    - Aug 24: Magic Showcase! They're gonna be announcing what content/sets/etc we can expect for the coming year
    - Aug 26: Jumpstart Historic Horizons drops on Arena
