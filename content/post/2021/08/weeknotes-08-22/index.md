### A quote:

> "And above all, watch with glittering eyes the whole world around you because the greatest secrets are always hidden in the most unlikely places. Those who donâ€™t believe in magic will never find it." -- Roald Dahl

(via [swiss-miss](https://www.swiss-miss.com/2021/08/watch-with-glittering-eyes.html))

### The world:

- We hit [record-breaking case numbers](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1428628534327717889) and death rates towards the end of the 15-day ECQ period. In spite of this, the IATF in their wisdom has decided to loosen our quarantine level to ["MECQ"](https://twitter.com/cnnphilippines/status/1428594948010479617). People note that the described restrictions in this flavor of MECQ are mostly the same as with the just-ended ECQ, except the supposedly lesser quarantine level is an excuse to no longer hand out any ayuda.
- In spite of the current covid surge, our erstwhile president chose to spend his precious time [affirming his bromance with the embattled DOH secretary](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/08/21/2121650/even-if-i-stand-alone-duterte-says-hell-stand-duque-amid-coa-findings).
- Philippine boxing legend and part-time senator Manny Pacquiao lost his match against Yordenis Ugas earlier today. He should take it as a hint and retire from the sport, like [he promised when he ran for the senate](/2016/09/BKrxCn5hQ3T/). Then maybe consider retiring from politics too.
- Dominating the international news this week: The [botched US withdrawal from Afghanistan](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/08/16/politics/biden-afghanistan-speech/index.html), the Taliban promising to respect women's rights and the rights of those evacuating the country and almost immediately breaking those promises.

### Links of interest:

Looks like I have mostly twitter stuff this week:

- Developer stuff: A [twitter thread on why try-catch exception handling is terrible](https://twitter.com/badamczewski01/status/1427248857197514754).
- Gamedev stuff: A couple of twitter threads about Skyrim that demonstrate how complicated gamedev is:
    - [thread about the infamous cart intro sequence](https://twitter.com/NPurkeypile/status/1427650365558857728)
    - [thread about the myth of the treasure fox](https://twitter.com/JoelBurgess/status/1428008041887281157)
- Chess stuff: A [twitter thread about the Immortal Zugzwang Game](https://twitter.com/rasmansa/status/1427271130382049284)
- Future dystopia stuff: Tesla announced [they are developing a humanoid robot](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/19/elon-musk-teases-tesla-bot-humanoid-robot-for-repetitive-tasks.html) based on their self-driving technology. This sort of thing is probably a long ways off, but that prototype model they're showing gives off a strong "automated storm trooper" vibe for me.
- Personal website stuff: I've been really enjoying browsing through [the blogroll at maya.land](https://maya.land/blogroll.opml)

### From the archives, this week in history:

- 2017: The [murder of Kian delos Santos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killings_of_Kian_delos_Santos,_Carl_Arnaiz_and_Reynaldo_de_Guzman), the most famous victim of Duterte's drug war
- 2012: [Interior secretary Jesse Robredo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Robredo), husband of the current Vice President, dies in a plane crash off Masbate Island
- 2009: I [went to Bangkok](/2009/08/grand-prix-bangkok/)! It was my first non-work overseas trip.
- 2008: I [created my Twitter account](/2008/08/889930055/)! 

  
### My stuff:

- Still [sketching daily](/albums/sketchbook/); Surprisingly I am not behind today. Here's one I did yesterday of Spider-Woman; it's a bit messy and I got too lazy to do any touchups or backgrounds or whatever, but I kind of like how it turned out:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: Only watched **Jumanji: The Next Level** during this week's Saturday gaming session. Will include this in the next set of reviews.
    - TV: Finished the **Parks and Recreation** rewatch! Such a great series. Started a rewatch of **House**, another great series. Second episode of **What If** was better than the first. Second pair of **Brookyln Nine-Nine** episodes were ok. **Superman and Lois** wrapped up their first season.
- **Gaming**:
    - On PS4: Played a bit of the **Tales of Arise** demo. My PS4 was acting up so I didn't get too far into it, but so far it's pretty much what I'd expect from a Tales game.
    - Still running through **Great Ace Attorney Chronicles**, now in the last case of GAA1 I believe.
    - Daily fighting games ongoing on weeknights: still **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**. I unlocked DLC character Akira with Fight Money in SFV, but haven't used her online yet as I was having a decent run with Birdie and didn't want to break it.
    - **Magic Arena:** Mostly durdling around. The queues and metagames are a bit stale/boring at the moment, hopefully this week's new releases shake things up.
- **Reading**: Finished up the stack of comic book collections I was reading, [wrote some words about them](/2021/08/stack-of-comics/). Found a copy of Ursula K LeGuin's *Left Hand of Darkness* for my Kindle app, so will probably go back to "real" books this week.
- No quiz night this past week (well, there was one, but we didn't like the categories so we skipped.) Just the usual crosswords and such.

### This coming week:

- Some MTG stuff this week!
    - Aug 24: Magic Showcase! They're gonna be announcing what content/sets/etc we can expect for the coming year
    - Aug 26: Jumpstart Historic Horizons drops on Arena
