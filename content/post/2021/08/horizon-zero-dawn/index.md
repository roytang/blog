I finished Horizon Zero Dawn a while back after getting a free copy off PS+ in June:

Then I spent a couple of weeks chasing the platinum trophy for the game. The PS+ copy also came with the Frozen Wilds DLC, so I spent another month or so playing through that expansion as well. I already finished all the Frozen Wilds quests and wanted to get all the Frozen Wilds trophies too. I already got most of the but the other day, one of them wouldn't pop, so I just gave up, so I can do this quick review + photo dump now.

HZD is one of those open world type games with a lot of combat and things to do and objectives and collectibles and such. It's quite a good game and also excellent visually, with a rich, colorful world. The overarching plot and the story of how the post-apocalyptic world of HZD came to be the way it was is pretty good as well, decent sci-fi. Overall the game was a great experience.

The combat is pretty good, and can be challenging even in normal mode, especially if you're like me with the unsteady hands and the being really bad at aiming. (The game has modes and tools to help with the being bad at aiming of course.) Some of the bigger machine monsters can be very challenging and lead to repetitive combats - they mostly have a ton of HP even if you're hitting their weak spots, and that's even if you strike first from stealth and use traps and such.

Frozen Wilds is an ok DLC, expands the overworld by around 20% I believe, and gives a couple of challenging new machines to fight and a bunch of stuff to do. My main complaint with Frozen Wilds is I don't like spending all the time in the snowy terrain, mainly because the mostly-white backgrounds make it hard to see anything using Aloy's focus (the equivalent of Batman's "Detective Mode" in the Arkham series).

There's a sequel, Horizon Forbidden West, coming out in 2022. Not sure if I'd wanna play it, though there are some hanging plot threads left to follow. My main concern is IDK if I even want to get a PS5. It will probably come out for PC eventually though, but I might need an upgrade.

Anyway, photo dump below!
