### Rurouni Kenshin: The Beginning (2021)

This is the fifth film in the series. [Previously](/2021/06/rurouni-kenshin-final/). 

The film is based on the manga story arc that covers Kenshin's time as an assassin during the fall of the shogunate, 10 years before the main story of the RK manga and anime. Basically the same storyline as the [Trust and Betrayal OVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rurouni_Kenshin:_Trust_%26_Betrayal). Except it doesn't cover the earliest part of Kenshin's story - I was hoping Hiko Seijuro would make an appearance, so that's a bit disappointing. 

It's still weird that this came last after the fourth film The Ending, since chronologically it should be first, but I can see why they'd want to end on this one. It's easily the best of the five films so far, mostly because it manages to be closest to the source material. And also because this particular story arc is tonally very different from the rest of the series, a lot more serious and dramatic, as opposed to the shonen manga battle focus of the rest of the series, thus making it more easily translated to live-action film. Overall very happy with this one.

### Jumanji: The Next Level (2019)

Saw this one during a regular Saturday gaming session with friends, same as [the previous movie](/2021/08/skyfall-jumanji-police-story/). It's more of the same, but the addition of Dannys Devito and Glover's characters is great, mainly because I really enjoyed The Rock channeling Devito and Kevin Hart channeling Glover. Still very much a popcorn movie.

### Superman and Lois season 1

Season finale of the latest Arrowverse show was last week, and the season was fairly good, not as much moody teenager drama as I had expected from the CW, and a lot more Krypton lore than we expected. The plot is not without it's problems, but it's certainly more serviceable than some of the more recent Arrowverse seasons. My main complaint about this series is that it's so... brown. Like a lot of the shots and scenes have this filtered brown or bluish-brown tone that makes me feel a bit sleepy. Contrast that with a show like The Flash, which is always very bright and colorful. They might have been going for a softer visual tone because much of the series is set in Smallville, but I feel like a Superman show needs to be more vibrant visually. The connections to the rest of the shows are still fairly loose, nothing except a Diggle appearance to tell us it's connected to the wider Arrowverse, so we still have no idea where this one fits timeline-wise, and also the answers to burning questions such as why does Supergirl have a much more elaborate Fortress of Solitude than Superman? I suppose we'll have to wait and see.
