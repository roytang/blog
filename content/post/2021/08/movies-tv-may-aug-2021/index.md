### Movies

#### The Man With The Golden Gun (1974)

<time id="ba2999c2cc9d8803ad982d24e52035e6">[2021-05-10 17:50] </time>

Bond movie no. 9: The Man With The Golden Gun (1974). Christopher Lee was a Bond villain! Beirut, Macau, Hong Kong, Bangkok. An Asian girl is introduced just for the pun in her name. Comic relief southern sheriff dude is back from the previous film. <!--sep-->Final fight scene with Nick Nack was ridiculous. As per usual, Bond gets captured and the bad guy explains everything. Still not used to Roger Moore in the role.

---

#### The Mitchells vs The Machines (2021)

<time id="1392042759863689217">[2021-05-11 17:03] </time>

{{< photos 1392042759863689217 >}}

Earlier today I watched The Mitchells vs the Machines on Netflix. It's a well-done, fantastic, ridiculous, fun, clever, family-friendly adventure, I really enjoyed it.

---

#### The Spy Who Loved Me (1977)

<time id="ea715fa4d23937c15e47022adf93e192">[2021-05-20 14:48] </time>

Bond film no. 10: The Spy Who Loved Me (1977). The best Moore installment so far. Excellent opening sequence. Austria; Cairo, Egypt; Sardinia, Italy. 007 and Triple-X have great chemistry. <!--sep-->Jaws has to be the most unstoppable Bond villain / henchman. Stromberg's Atlantis reminds me of the Legion of Doom's base in the old Superfriends cartoon. Actually, I think his evil plan might be the best one so far as well.<!--sep-->I wonder if I can get through the rest of these before No Time to Die actually comes out lol.

#### Mortal Kombat (2021)

<time id="09b5a24d69042602b9ac909e277987a6">[2021-05-21 16:48] </time>

Watched Mortal Kombat (2021). Some friends tried to tell me not to waste my time, but joke's on them I enjoyed it anyway! In hindsight, the plot was pretty flimsy, but I enjoyed the fights. It's basically what you'd expect lol.

---

#### Moonraker (1979)

<time id="cbb6135fa20b48a488982eccc7df76ce">[2021-06-02 16:44] </time>

Watched Moonraker (1979). Spectacular opening sequence. Villain reminds me of Tyrion Lannister. California -> Venice -> Rio de Janeiro. Mandatory canal chase while in Venice, obviously. Lots of of product placement.

A bad guy tried to ambush 007 with a KENDO STICK. Have they heard of guns? Comically indestructible assassin Jaws appears again, and actually has a character arc this time.

First half of the movie was kind of meh, but the last third of the film with the space station and the laser battles and the ridiculous villain plan kind of won me over with how campy it all was.

---

#### For Your Eyes Only (1981)

<time id="2641c1868d6ccb70715302ea340cae74">[2021-06-08 00:50] </time>

For Your Eyes Only (1981): Bond film no. 12. After the sci-fi fantasy of Moonraker, this one is more grounded and down-to-Earth, a callback to early Connery adventures. No megamalomaniacs to defeat, just foreign agents and mercs.

The opening sequence pays homage to the earlier pre-Moore films, acknowledging the death of Tracy Bond and killing off a villain that looks suspiciously like arch-nemesis Blofeld. The opening song is pretty good.

The rest of the film was ok, if a bit forgettable. I liked the rock climbing scene, but the ski chase and car chases felt like things we've seen before. Also, Moore is starting to show his age.

Melina Havelock (portrayed by Carole Bouquet) reminded me a lot of DC’s Huntress - a crossbow-wielding woman out for revenge

#### Octopussy (1983)

<time id="1639118365d91bdbd1a41eb9b170a9a0">[2021-06-16 11:03] </time>

Yesterday I saw Octopussy (1983), Bond film no. 13. Another grounded entry with no fantastical elements, with the plot centered around geopolitical concerns. Some interesting action sequences, but overall, but I found most of the movie unremarkable.

India shown as an exotic place (w/c I suppose it was to Westerners at that time) with elephants and firebreathers and whatnot all over. There was one scene where the bad guy appears to have broken a genuine Faberge egg but no one said anything lol.

---

#### A View To A Kill (1985)

<time id="7d38789afe70956e56d61914ed7d195a">[2021-06-24 17:03] </time>

Watched A View To A Kill (1985), Bond film no. 14. Moore is showing his age, luckily this is his last entry. Very 80s theme song by Duran Duran. Christopher Walken is here, as a Bond villain with a plan straight out of Superman (1978).

Tanya Roberts plays a young Bond girl just 14 years before playing a middle-aged mom on That 70s Show. Random young Dolph Lundgren cameo! Kind of a ridiculous street chase scene through San Francisco. Overall not the best of Moore's run.

---

#### Transformers: The Last Knight (2017)

<time id="2789a7cda3fd16feca84b58fae45811b">[2021-06-27 11:00] </time>

In the wee hours earlier for some reason I decided to watch Transformers: The Last Knight (2017) while playing online boardgames with friends. It was the only one of the Bayverse films I hadn't seen yet, and now that I have that seemed like a good decision. Too long, ridiculous plot, and once again the Decepticons barely distinguishable from each other. 

The story needs a lot of suspension of disbelief. Lots of spectacle as you'd expect from Michael Bay. Surprised they managed to get Anthony Hopkins for this. John Turturro is still around, but serving only as plot exposition. They decided to introduce a new female lead that looked as close to Megan Fox as possible. 

The movie ends with Cybertron crashed into Earth, so you kind of have to suspend your belief in physics as well. Also, apparently Earth is Unicron! WTH lol.

---

#### Downsizing (2017)

<time id="c7033ad094d89afab1a8e1abcb2c3015">[2021-06-28 13:49] </time>

Was stuck in a waiting room long enough to watch Downsizing (2017) on cable. Interesting sci-fi concept (miniaturizing humans to reduce consumption and avoid climate change) serving as background for a mediocre Matt Damon story.

---

#### The Living Daylights (1987)

<time id="69d2374b0f0232065102954a54736506">[2021-07-01 21:48] </time>

The Living Daylights (1987): Bond film no. 15 and first of only two Dalton entries. More 80s music theme song, this time by A-ha. Much more serious in tone compared to Connery / Moore. John Rhys-Davies is here, years before Sliders or LOTR. <!--sep-->No sci-fi mad scientist stuff this time, straight-up spy stuff (more or less). Assassinations, defections, Russia's internal politics, Afghan rebels, weapons, smuggling, drug deals, faked deaths, etc. Might be a tiny bit too long. Surprisingly, I liked this one!

#### License to Kill (1989)

<time id="4e93006d466cb2f6a53325cba8e27b63">[2021-07-03 18:41] </time>

License to Kill (1989): Bond film no 16, Dalton's second and last outing is much darker and yet weaker than the first one. The first one where Bond goes rogue, driven by vengeance instead of duty. Unremarkable theme song. Villain is a drug smuggler; <!--sep-->I guess with the collapse of the USSR they couldn't have another Russia-centered plot. More actors look familiar as we near the 90s. Notable are a young Benicio del Toro playing a henchman and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (known for playing Shang Tsung. <!--sep-->Dalton's performance is mixed, and for some reason he reminds me of Sir Patrick Stewart in some scenes. Too bad he couldn't have had a better sendoff as Bond.

---

#### Under Siege (1992)

<time id="cb5279cfdbc686e55eef33bd58e8aaeb">[2021-07-04 12:02] </time>

Saturday gaming group decided to do a movie watch-along while we played and randomly settled on Under Siege (1992) for some reason. I'd never seen it before and several times I said "Isn't this just Die Hard on a boat?" and apparently that was a universal consensus. Very 90s. <!--sep-->Unsurprisingly this is already Seagal's best-rated movie and has a surprising number of familiar and even good actors, including Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Busey, and Colm Meaney (Star Trek's O'Brien)

---

#### Saturday the 10th Movies

<time id="saturday-10-movies">[2021-07-11 08:00] </time>

A couple of movies we watched during our Saturday gaming session yesterday:

- **America the Motion Picture (2021)**. Alternate history retelling of American revoluion, complete and utter nonsense. Good fun and we had a few laughs, but I really hope no American takes it seriously.
- **Ice Road (2021)**. Random Liam Neeson action flick that we actual started last Saturday. Somehow they managed to make a two hour movie about driving a truck across the ice. I thought it would be better than it was because it had Laurence Fishburn, but I guess that's not really a good basis. One of those films where I wouldn't have minded sitting through it on cable, if I was busy doing something else.

### TV

#### Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan season 2

<time id="99d3f5dffa9b1e1f2a4029f66c2b4f2a">[2021-05-01 20:07] </time>

I binged season 2 of Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan this week (after watching season 1 back in 2018!). This season felt tighter than the first in terms of pacing and such. But I'm not happy with the way it promotes American interventionism and their easy willingness to interfere in the affairs of a sovereign nation (however justified it may be)

---

#### Kim's Convenience season 5

<time id="1400634591166156805">[2021-06-04 10:04] </time>

Binged thru S5 of Kim's Convenience yesterday. Still so easy to background-watch. Too bad it's the final season, they still had a few open threads to resolve.

https://www.avclub.com/simu-liu-opens-up-about-his-anger-and-unhappiness-over-1847022561 Apparently there's a planned spinoff starring *Shannon*, who's the second-worst character on the show! WTH. (Worst character is Janet lol)
