### A quote:

> "Whatever the present moment contains, accept it as if you had chosen it. Always work with it, not against it." - Eckhart Tolle

### The world:

- We are one week into the current NCR ECQ lockdown. Covid19 and the Delta variant continue to rampage through the country; [the DOH reported 14k+ new cases today, the 2nd highest daily rate since the pandemic started](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1426816192845553665), the positive testing rate staying above 20% for more than a week (signaling not enough testing - WHO recommended rate is 5%). The hospitals are starting to fill up again. Rumors are already circulating that the lockdown might be extended; [businesses have pre-emptively said no](https://www.manilastandard.net/news/top-stories/362344/business-bucks-ecq-extension-fears-health-livelihood-crisis-may-worsen.html), but what are we going to do if the cases just keep going up?
- Erstwhile DOH secretary Duque is in hot water again after the [COA flagged his department](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/8/11/COA-DOH-67-billion-COVID-pandemic-funds.html) for mismanagement of P67B pandemic funds. Duque truly is this administration's Abaya.
- The US is completing their withdrawal from Afghanistan this month, and the Taliban [has rapidly made advances](https://nypost.com/2021/08/09/taliban-takes-control-of-cities-in-afghanistan-in-a-week/), capturing and now [they are poised to take Kabul](https://twitter.com/AJENews/status/1426821557540765697). Yet another failed American war?

- [Nestflix](https://nestflix.fun/) is a website that presents a faux Netflix-like service except it lists out fictional movies and TV shows that were featured in actual movies and TV shows
- [The case for optimism](https://www.warpnews.org/premium-content/kevin-kelly-the-case-for-optimism/). It's been difficult to stay optimistic with everything happening in the world, but we need to remind ourselves to still remain optimistic to help us find a way forward.

### From the archives, this week in history:

- 2015: [I crashed out of GP London](/2015/08/grand-prix-london-2015/)
- 2014: [RIP Robin Williams](/2014/08/499025938282074113/)

### My stuff:

- I [celebrated my forty-third last week](/2021/08/forty-three/)! "Celebrated" might be a bit of a stretch, since we are still in a pandemic, and the day was largely uneventful.
- Early this week, the Metro Manila mayors decided to [ban outdoor exercise during the ECQ lockdown](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/8/10/Metro-Manila-bans-outdoor-exercise.html). So I haven't been able to do my usual outdoors walking. It's actually not likely that anyone accosts me for outdoors exercise as long as its within the confines of my subdivision, but I like to pretend that I'm following the law, even if the law is ridiculous.
- Still [sketching](/albums/sketchbook/); I am once again behind on the weekends, as it happens. Here's a sketch of Gandalf. It's not particularly good, but it turned out looking a lot more than Ian McKellen than I thought it would:

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: This week's movies: [Skyfall, Jumanji and Police Story](/2021/08/skyfall-jumanji-police-story/)
    - TV: **Parks and Recreation** rewatch is up to season 6. I found the first episode of **What If** to be a bit underwhelming. Final season of **Brooklyn Nine Nine** has started, and I know they had to address all the policing issues of the past couple of years, but the first two episodes felt a bit heavy handed.
- **Gaming**:
    - No **Horizon Zero Dawn (PS4)** this week, instead I played through four cases of **The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles**. I'm enjoying the game, and I am getting a lot of screenshots for the eventual review.
    - Daily fighting games ongoing on weeknights: both **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**. I've already earned enough fight money in SFV to unlock Akira (the only season 5 DLC character I want to get) when she releases later this week.
    - **Magic Arena:** I was looking forward to the release of **Jumpstart Historic Horizons** this week, but that has been delayed most likely for software development reasons (which I of course understand completely!). They're giving us some free drafts as compensation, so that's something. I also tried playing Standard for a while, but Winota mirrors are so boring, so I decided to explore the Standard 2022 queue. Still not doing well, but at least it's more varied. I like the idea of Standard 2022, it's kind of like Block Constructed, which deserved better.
    - Regular Saturday group played some [Root](/2021/05/root/) and [Blood Rage](/2021/03/blood-rage/) again, as usual. I think I won't be logging this moving forward until we pick up new games.
- **Reading**: Still comics again this week. Comics **are** books, but I should also start looking up for new traditional books to read.
- No quiz night this past week, just the usual NY Times crosswords and spelling bee with the trivia team. I also started doing [the Newsday crossword online](/2021/08/1426529886261239808/), which are the same ones I've been doing in the daily newspaper, having them online is more convenient.

### This coming week:

- Aug 16 Akira releases on SFV! Oro releases too, I guess.
- Aug 18 Free demo of Tales of Arise is coming out!
