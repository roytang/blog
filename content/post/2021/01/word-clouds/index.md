title: 2020 Word Clouds
---

Word clouds! They used to be a thing right? I was reminded of them yesterday and I wish I had thought of this in time for the [2020 year in review](/2021/01/2020-year-in-review/), but here we are. 

I thought I'd generate some word clouds for the blog anyway! 

Here's the word cloud for all my blog posts for the year:

And here's a word cloud for all my tweets for the year:

I don't know if these word clouds are supposed to mean anything, except possibly that I use the words ONE TIME all too often? Oops, I did it again!

** I used [this library](https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud) for the actual generation

** I'll see if I remember to do this again for succeeding year in review posts!
