(Raw material to be hammered into an actual post)

I'm thinking about discussing the implications of Trump/Parler being kicked off the major platforms, but it's kind of a complicated issue so I want to make sure all my thoughts are in order. Maybe use this space? Let's try for a bit.

Ok, so it's kind of a free speech issue, except the censorship is being done by a private entity, so it specifically doesn't violate the US first amendment. I think that without question, I agree that social media platforms have a right to pick and choose what they allow on their platforms (except those that they aren't allowed to discriminate against, by law, like race, religion, etc). And Trump absolutely violated ToS by inciting the Jan 6 riots. People are thinking this is a free speech issue because being deplatformed feels similar to being escorted off and banned from a public square. Of course, if you were on a public square goading people to raid govt buildings and kill elected officials, a lot of people would you want you dragged away from there anyway. That being said, I think the bigger issue is why have we these tech companies/platforms that are being treated as de facto public squares in the first place. It feels like we shouldn't have allowed them to grow to this size/amount of influence in the first place.

Now, Parler. In theory, Parler could have become a competing public square, in fact that's one of the things it's doing. But Parler itself has been deplatformed, not just by Google/Apple, but by the webhost, AWS. I don't have any opinions either way about the app stores kicking them out (although I will say Apple is more egregious, since there's no alternative to Apple's app store on iOS), but AWS kicking them out seems more problematic. It is a bit analogous to a landlord kicking out a tenant from their building because they are doing illegal things, like maybe running a meth lab? So by that analogy it can be justified. Technically, the discussions on Parler aren't directly violent, but they are planning violence. So, can a landlord evict a tenant because his space was being used to plot violence?

Anyway, it's super dumb to be planning these things in public anyway! Why don't they get private forums, those are still things right? Or even a private FB group. Can FB ban them for discussions in a private group? Maybe.
