draft: true

Well, it has certainly been another revolution around the sun. I added the tag [yearnotes](/tags/yearnotes) for these end-of-year recap and statistic things.

2020 Statistics:

Work, Travel, Learning and Self Improvement:

  * Hours worked: ~100 hours (estimated) - down from ~200 hours last year
    * I mostly took the pandemic as a chance to chill for a bit, except for the occasional support consultancy work. 
  * Programming languages/frameworks learned: 1, same as last year
    * I learned the Flutter mobile framework to rewrite a mobile app charity project I did for some friends
  * Some other stuff/projects:
    * I rebuilt this site in the latest version of Django
    * Migrated this site to a new webhost
    * Migrated my main email usage [away from Google](/2020/05/gmail-migration/)
  * Books read: 2, half as much as last year T_T
    * [Atomic Habits by James Clear](/2020/01/atomic-habits/)
    * [Rhythm of War by Brandon Sanderson](/2020/12/rhythm-of-war/)
    * Action item: read more books (again)
  * Duolingo streak: 719 days (from 355 last year). It seems that I never broke the streak from 2019, so my longest streak continues. The numbers don't add up - 355 + 366 should be 721 - but this may be because this wasn't a true streak. I think I used two "streak freeze" powerups throughout the year, so I actually broke the streak twice lol. I don't care, I'm counting it!
  * Other countries visited: 0!

Social media:

{{% spoiler %}}
  * Facebook activity: 
    * 32 posts (down from 315 last year, and 1081 in 2018). I deactivated my Facebook account in the middle of the year, so I can say Operation: Reduce Facebook Usage has succeeded.
    * 322 comments (up from 138 last year). I did however have more comments, because of quiz nights being held on FB live during the pandemic! 
  * Tweets: TBA (down from 1124 last year)
  * [Instagram](/syndicated/instagram) photos: TBA. 108 last year
  * Reddit activity:
    * TBA submissions (20 last year)

  * 0 words written for [Nanowrimo](https://nanowrimo.org/)
  * 0 sketches submitted to [r/sketchdaily](https://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily) (down from 35 last year)
  * 224 blog posts, 119529 words worth; up from 105 posts and 62888 words last year. A record for this blog's lifetime. It may be a bit above the volume I want though.

  * Wakes attended: 0
