I used to collect quotes a lot. Maybe I still do. Here are a couple of collections I've posted online.

[Tang In Cheek](/quotes/tic/) - a list of quotes (allegedly by me)

[Email signatures](/quotes/sig/) - a list of quotes I used as a pool to randomly select an email signature from. I rarely send email these days, and when I do it's usually web-based, so I can't use these anymore.

There's probably a better way to organize these. I mean, I kind of want some kind of upvoting system like they have at bash.org (to see which quotes the three readers of this blog like), but that's a side project for another day.

There's also a list page at [/quotes/](/quotes/) which maybe I'll add to the menus somewhere? For fun.
