A while back [I wrote about an app some friends and I used to play called Draw Something](/2019/02/draw-something/), where players made crude drawings using limited tools and the other player had to guess what the drawing was. While cleaning up some old photos during the past week I found another batch of Draw Something screenshots; I had forgotten that we had a second wave of playing the game back in 2017. It's fun to look at these screenshots and see how the drawings were made and guess what we were thinking of back then. 

This app may or may not have been part of my secret effort to get my friends to draw more, even though none of them would identify as artists. (Neither do I, though I do [some regular sketching](/albums/sketchbook) and one of the screenshots here shows that one of my anon co-players seems to have identify me as such.) I find that "normal" people who say "I can't draw" often just mean "I can't draw well", which means they don't want to go through the sucky phase of learning how to draw. But this app's drawing toolset helps overcome that mentality, since it's so limited that most drawings really look primitive anyway. More people getting into drawing can't be bad. (Unfortunately, I don't think I succeeded in getting any of my friends to draw more often lol.)

I didn't include some photos where the anon co-player just wrote out a text description using the paint tools, because why would you do that? You're spoiling the fun of the game; if you didn't want to draw, you should've probably tried playing something else!

I believe the app is still in the store, so you can try it out if you like! Who knows, maybe my friends and I will indulge in a third wave of playing this game and I'll have another batch of screenshots to share in the future.
