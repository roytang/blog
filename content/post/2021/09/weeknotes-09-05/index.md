### A quote:

> “Man is only fully human when he plays!” - Friedrich Schiller

### The world:

- Our MECQ period is due to end on the 7th, after which NCR is going to enter an experimental phase of ["granular lockdowns"](https://www.cnn.ph/news/2021/9/4/NCR-granular-lockdown.html) where people in certain areas will not be allowed to come and go at all. Presumably food and other supplies will be brought to them, and [if they have to leave for work because they are essential workers, they can't come back - employers need to either provide temporary lodging or allow them to WFH](https://www.rappler.com/nation/lopez-says-philippines-expected-enforce-granular-lockdowns). As if those things are easy! We'll see how terrible this turns out.
- In the meantime, cases are still trending high, and our president is busy [picking fights to distract from procurement corruption scandals as exposed in recent Senate hearings](https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2021/09/04/2124713/gordon-duterte-tirades-distracting-public-scandals). In response to the attacks, his favorite senator / lackey / presidential assistant has [declared undying love](https://twitter.com/roytang/status/1432637132179267584/).
- In what seems to be the next step of Xi Jinping's own cultural revolution, China has banned [minors from playing online games except for 3 specific hours on the weekends](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/china-bans-online-gaming-for-minors-except-from-8-pm-9-pm-friday-to-sunday/) and also [effeminate men from tv](https://www.npr.org/2021/09/02/1033687586/china-ban-effeminate-men-tv-official-morality).

### From the archives, this week in history:

- 2015: I played at [Grand Prix London](/2015/08/grand-prix-london-2015/)!
- 2013: I [started Duolingo](/2021/09/1433819215207624706/)!
- 2009: [Disney buys Marvel for FOUR BILLION DOLLARS](/2009/08/3667456100/), starting them the road of the being the world's biggest media conglomerate. Yet here we are, 12 years later, and still no Marvel vs Disney vs Capcom.
  
### My stuff:

- Still [sketching daily](/albums/sketchbook/); I am again behind by a few days; here's a comic-style thing I did to celebrate the transition into PH Christmas season:

{{< photo "2021/09/1433044241735770115/" >}}

- **Watching:**
    - Movies: Only one I watched this week is [Spectre (2015)](/2021/09/spectre/), last of the James Bond run.
    - TV: Fourth episode of **What If** was kinda dark, wasn't it? This week's **Brookyln Nine-Nine** episodes were still meh. Still behind on Arrowverse stuff. **Ted Lasso S2** seems to be meandering a lot. Still enjoying my **House** rewatch, maybe a bit too much, as I may have dreamt myself into a House-like episode.
- **Gaming**:
    - [Finished GAA1](/2021/09/1433407001590071296/) in **Great Ace Attorney Chronicles**!
    - Daily fighting games ongoing on weeknights: **Guilty Gear Strive**: There's a new DLC character released for GGS this week, but I haven't encountered her as an opponent yet. Also tried to play **Street Fighter V**, but found it hard to find matches again. I did manage to get the 300 wins achievement already though!
    - **Magic Arena:** [Played a lot of Jumpstart Historic Horizons](/2021/08/1430936936240214026/)! Preview / spoiler season for the upcoming set **Innistrad: Midnight Hunt** have also started this week. I'm not too impressed, and the new Daybound / Nightbound implement seems like it might be a bit clunky, need to see how it plays.
    - I missed Mythic rank on Arena for the end of the month, but I did manage to [land on the monthly Eternal Card Game leaderboards for the first time](/2021/09/1433260717772214272/)!
- **Reading**: A bit more than halfway through Ursula K LeGuin's *Left Hand of Darkness* 
- No quiz nights still, so trivia group still doing the NYT crosswords and also occasionally the [Newsday crossword](https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/extras/crossword-puzzle-1.6375288), even though it [sometimes has sus clues](/2021/09/1433816033547096067/)

### This coming week:

- **Tales of Arise** releases this week; but I probably won't be getting it immediately, especially since I still have a couple of older Tales games on the backlog
