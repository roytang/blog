title: Supergirl Finale Arrowverse
---

Supergirl had their series finale last week; the usual big superhero fight affair with a heavy-handed focus on "empowering people" typical of the series and relying on Supergirl making a big speech to inspire everyone in the world. Ended with a lesbian wedding, so go diversity.

Wasn't a big fan of this season, waaay too much magic and time spent in the phantom zone and such. The last part was basically them chasing a set of McGuffins each with different rules that let them do a different gimmick with each episode and gave Kara an excuse to have another inner dilemma or such.

The [Arrowverse](/tags/arrowverse) as a whole feels like it's on its last legs and should maybe be just quietly ended already. I mean, don't get me wrong, the Arrowverse as a whole is pretty mediocre, but it had some great moments, certainly the [crisis crossover](/2020/01/crisis-on-infinite-earths/) was unprecedented in the serialized TV. But a lot of the seasons since then feels like they're just coasting along and struggling with pacing issues and scifi or magic nonsense. [Superman and Lois season 1](/2021/08/rktb-jtnl-sl/) was fairly good, but that's because the series is new and doesn't have the baggage that **Flash** or **Supergirl** have. I didn't even bother with **Batwoman** or **Black Lightning**. **Legends of Tomorrow** is still nonsense, but at least it's fun nonsense that isn't preachy and doesn't take itself seriously.

I think the main problem for series like Flash or Supergirl is that they're still committed to the old school TV format of 20-24 episodes for a season, and try to maintain a single big bad (or set of big bads) for the entire season. This leads to a lot of pacing issues and filler episodes that they have to justify with handwaved nonsense scifi or magic or whatever. [Agents of Shield](/tags/agentsofshield) managed to avoid this problem in their later seasons by splitting each season into "pods" with 7-8 episodes each and dealing with a different story arc/big bad for each pod. I would guess that 7-8 episodes is the sweet spot for comic book-based TV series, given the relative success of the Netflix and the Marvel Disney+ ones.

Another thing that surprised me about the Supergirl ending is that they decided to keep Kara still in the universe at the end; I assumed she would jet off to the future to join the Legion or something. It's an issue because of the shared universe where there are always these world-threatening problems and you have superheroes like Superman, Supergirl and the Flash around, but they don't really go help with each others' problems? It was especially weird with Supergirl's series finale where a lot of past allies came back for cameos but her cousin Superman didn't bother to show up (even though Lex is supposedly *his* nemesis!). The Arrowverse in general has been less crossover-y post-crisis, which makes it feel a lot less like a shared universe. Superman and Lois barely even nods to the other series and I'm still not sure where it stands timeline wise with the others, but maybe that separation is what kept the first season fairly fresh. 

We supposedly have a minor crossover to kick off the next season of The Flash which airs this week. That's another series that feels like it's just hobbling along and is probably already 1 or 2 seasons longer than it needed to be. I will still be watching Flash and Legends moving forward probably, but if those series end along with the Arrowverse in general, I wouldn't mind. Might be time for something fresh.
