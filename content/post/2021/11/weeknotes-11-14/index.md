### A Quote

> "I think it's much more interesting to live not knowing than to have answers which might be wrong. I have approximate answers and possible beliefs and different degrees of uncertainty about different things, but I am not absolutely sure of anything and there are many things I don't know anything about, such as whether it means anything to ask why we're here. I don't have to know an answer. I don't feel frightened not knowing things, by being lost in a mysterious universe without any purpose, which is the way it really is as far as I can tell." - [Richard P.Feynman](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/8411-i-think-it-s-much-more-interesting-to-live-not-knowing)

### The World

- PH election drama reached a fever pitch over the weekend as Monday's substitution deadline loomed. Sara Duterte, erstwhile daughter of the current president, withdrew her candidacy for Davao City mayor and soon after joined GMA's Lakas-CMD for the predictable substitution into a [candidacy for the Vice President slot](https://www.cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/11/13/Sara-Duterte-vice-president-2022-Lakas-CMD.html), and was instantly adopted as the running mate of the dictator's son, a deal allegedly brokered by GMA herself. An alliance of GMA and the Marcos and Duterte scions feels like some kind of real-life Legion of Doom forming.
- To add to the drama and chaos, PDP-Laban, apparently left out of the deal-making and unable to trust the Marcoses, shifted around their candidates as well. Presidential candidate Bato dela Rosa withdrew his candidacy. Former VP candidate and erstwhile simpering lackey [Bong Go stepped up as a Presidential candidate](https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/11/13/Bong-Go-president-2022.html). And supposedly tomorrow, the [current president himself will file his candidacy as VP](https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2021/11/13/Duterte-vice-president-2022-elections.html) and running mate to Bong Go. What a circus!
- [News broke last night](https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1459559652937502727) that the huge globe in front of SM Mall of Asia had somehow been "stolen", which is ridiculous. This morning, they admitted [it was a publicity stunt to promote Netflix's new film "Red Notice"](https://twitter.com/rapplerdotcom/status/1459751443397693443). Lame.
- Meanwhile, we are still in a pandemic. Metro Manila stays at Alert Level 2 until the end of the month. [Cases might start trending up again though](https://twitter.com/EdsonCGuido/status/1459761846395621376).

### My stuff:

- My week was full of errands, which means I went out quite a few times this week, despite the pandemic. Mostly hospitals and clinics and pharmacies, you know how it is. Kind of falling behind on a bunch of my regular things as a result.
- Still [sketching daily](/albums/sketchbook/), and I have surprisingly not fallen behind this weekend yet. Here's a dog I drew:

- **Gaming**:
    - Been playing a lot more **Tales of Symphonia** lately. I'm enjoying it so much that I've started queueing up more Tales games to play: I bought a used copy of **Tales of Xillia 2** for PS3 on Lazada last week. For some reason I never got around to it even though I really enjoyed the first game. I tried out the copy and it was working fine, and just trying out the combat system made me excited to get into it, so hopefully I can finish Symphonia soon.
    - Also still playing **Great Ace Attorney**, though a bit less due to more time spent on Symphonia. Still hoping to finish both games before the end of the year!
    - Fighting games still ongoing: **Guilty Gear Strive** and **Street Fighter V**.
    - New sets dropped on both **Eternal** and **Magic Arena**! I cribbed a fun new Expedition deck for Eternal, and also started drafting Crimson Vow in Magic Arena.
    - **Shin Megami Tensei V** for Switch also dropped last week, I'm probably going to get it eventually, but I'm holding off since I still have so many things to play!
- **Watching:**
    - **Movies:** Watched [Blade Runner 2049](https://roytang.net/2021/11/4737c6da7ee142af8b00576b407172a2/) and [Shang-Chi](https://roytang.net/2021/11/shang-chi/) this past week. Next: No Time To Die?!?
    - **TV:** **Supergirl** had its series finale this past week; I have some thoughts on that and the present state of the Arrowverse, maybe I'll write some words about it later this week.
- **Reading:** I finished reading [The Conjugal Dictatorship](https://roytang.net/2021/11/conjugal-dictatorship/) last week. Still thinking about what to read next.
- Trivia team: The regular crosswords continue.

### This coming week:

- Amazon's **Wheel of Time** adaptation should be debuting this week, we'll see if I actually have time to watch it!
- Trivia team actually has a quiz night this week!
