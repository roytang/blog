Shang-Chi finally came out on BR/D+, so I got to watch it at last. 

Traditional spoiler-free review (despite not being able to watch day one in the cinema), then spoilery bits follow:

- Fun kung fu movie. The plot is a bit meh and there's some pacing issues in the middle, but the action is great.
- The fight scenes are pretty good, although this makes me sad for the lost potential of the Iron Fist Netflix series. 
- Fight scenes felt kinda dragonball-y towards the end though.
- So many MCU cameos, fun for the MCU fan
- I found it hard to take Simu Liu seriously at first, given how I still see him as his character from Kim's Convenience, but he had his moments later on in the film
- Tony Leung is a fantastic actor, and his role gives the film a slightly more serious tone compared to most MCU origin movies since he isn't as straightforward as most MCU villains
- There's still a bit of that MCU humor sprinkled here and there, but feels like not as much as other films
- There is a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene at the very end
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? I doubt; she's not big on kung fu movies.
- Solid 4/5 for me. 
- I miss watching the MCU films day one in the theaters, I think that was part of the enjoyment for me; hopefully we can get back there soon.

- I'm not super familiar with comic book Shang-Chi, but I'm pretty sure he's mostly just a really good martial artist. Ending the film with him having the Ten Rings makes him a lot more than that; I actually expected that the rings would get destroyed to defeat the Dweller-in-Darkness but it looks like it's going to be a bigger part of the MCU's future moving forward.
- the comparisons to Iron Fist are inevitable; so much lost potential, as Iron Fist is the more well-known Marvel character and would have been a good opportunity to introduce a good kung fu character and storyline and the MCU's first on-screen dragon, but unfortunately Netflix flubbed the implementation (although I guess it's hard to compare given the difference in budgets...). I suppose it's better that way, as at leas the MCU's first real kung fu story/film features actual Asian leads / characters. Iron Fist walked so that Shang-Chi could fly. (Marvel Comics also recently announced that the Danny Rand character is retiring and they're going to have a new Iron Fist of Asian descent, I would assume this is so they could introduce that character to the MCU in the future.)
- Did I mention there's a dragon?!? A huge, flying dragon?!? 
- I like the Abomination cameo, basically just telling us he's still alive and that the Hulk movie is still canon probably. Also really happy to see Brie Larson again, even if only for a short bit.
