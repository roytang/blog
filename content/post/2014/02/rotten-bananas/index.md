*Archivist's note: This is an archive of social media posts about the "Rotten Bananas" incident when I had a spirited discussion with Globe over their "unlimited" data plan. The convo went a bit viral for a while. Unfortunately because @talk2globe has deleted the older tweets, I am unable to reconstruct the original thread.*

[@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) so, if only 3% of your subscribers are getting screwed, it's okay?

<time>[Fri, Feb. 7, 2014, 6:53 a.m.]</time> [@KenOfGlobe](https://twitter.com/KenOfGlobe/) how is that fair to the 3%? They pay the same amount, but they have limits. That's not what UNLIMITED means

<time>[Fri, Feb. 7, 2014, 6:53 a.m.]</time> [@KenOfGlobe](https://twitter.com/KenOfGlobe/) Where did Globe get the 3% statistic, is it 3% of all unlimited mobile subscribers? What about home users of globe tattoo?

[@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) why are you offering an UNLIMITED plan if you cant handle your customers availing of what theyre paying for

<time>[Fri, Feb. 7, 2014, 8:40 p.m.]</time> Yeah, so I had a bit of fun with our Globe friends over on Twitter today. I think they finally got tired of giving me the runaround when it became obvious I wasn't going to stop :p Saging lang ang may puso!

<time>[Sat, Feb. 8, 2014, 7:47 a.m.]</time> Re: Globe, For the record, I personally don't mind having the 1GB/3GB limits, my mobile usage isn't that much and I have wired internet at home. (Although I wouldn't mind higher limits - there are apps that are larger than 1GB!) But the problem is that the plans are being marketed as "UNLIMITED" (and when confronted with this, they'll try to weasel out with technicalities like "it's still unlimited after the cap, just 2G") and they treat the "3%" who make the most of the UNLIMITED plan as "abusers" who are not "fair". In my opinion, if their network can't handle the congestion, they shouldn't sell these plans as "UNLIMITED".
