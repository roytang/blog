### Can You Have Too Much Street Fighter IV?

Look, I love Street Fighter so much, I paid for Street Fighter IV so many times!

- I bought the original [back in 2009](/2009/03/street-fighter-iv-the-answer-lies-in-the-heart-of-battle/) (as of 2024, I don't know where this disc is!)
- For some reason I purchased a separate retail copy of Super Street Fighter IV in 2010
- I bought the Arcade Edition DLC (via an account shared with some friends)
- I bought the 3DS version of SSF4 sometime in Apr 2011 (it was a 3DS launch title!)
- In 2011 I also purchased Street Fighter IV and Street Fighter IV Volt [on the app store](/2020/07/itunes-purchases/).
- I bought a separate retail copy of Ultra Street Fighter IV for PS3 in Aug 2014. Why didn't I buy DLC?!?
- I bought a copy of USFIV on Steam in 2015. As of 2024, I have 0 playtime on this version!

### Competition and Completion

SF4/SSF4 was the first fighting game I was able to play online, and where I realized I wasn't very good at the genre despite enjoying it a lot. It's also one of the few games I played in the arcades, a dying medium at the time. 

My brother and I even considered playing in some local tournaments! I think he was the only one who ended up joining one and he got eliminated in the second round.

Ultimately it was a problem of execution. A lot of the top-tier gameplay revolved around use of a mechanic called "Focus Attack Dash Cancel" which I had a lot of trouble executing, even in training mode.

The achievement list for this game was also very challenging (it was Capcom's first time considering fighting game online play for achievements), I was very far from completion.

### Street Fighter IV iOS version

I'm not sure why it is often so hard to decide to spend $0.99 on the app store!

<time>[2011-02-11 07:54]</time>

<time>[07:56]</time> [@CapcomMobile](https://twitter.com/CapcomMobile/) the iPhone version is neat, but is there any chance of an iPad version for SF4 coming out?

<time>[23:44]</time> SF4 on the iPad is fun enough, although the non-HD ness of the graphics is obvious when playing at 2x. Good enough for 99c :D

<time>[2011-02-12 07:56]</time> I unlocked the "CAPCOM Follower" achievement! [7/100] #sf4i

<time>[2011-02-12 07:586]</time> I unlocked the "Tweet Fighter" achievement! [8/100] #sf4i

Looks like the 99 cents for SF4 on the iPad was well-spent. It plays pretty well, I think it's even better on the iPad than it was on the iPhone. Oh, and it has GameCenter achievements! A hundred of them! Haha I'm such a sucker for this sort of thing. Achievements that is. Well, and Street Fighter as well.
