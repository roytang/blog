title: Movies I Watched In 2014
---

#### Shawshank Redemption (1994)

<time>[2014-01-05 20:31] </time> "Get busy living, or get busy dying" Just watched Shawshank Redemption for the first time

#### Invictus (2009)

<time>[2014-01-26 16:13] </time> This weekend's movie was Invictus, great movie, even though I knew nothing about rugby. Is it possible to watch too much Morgan Freeman?

#### Ender's Game (2013)

<time>[2014-02-08 23:14] </time> Just finished watching Ender's Game. So many things lost from the book!

#### Captain America: Winter Soldier

<time>[2014-03-27 14:03] </time> Cap America 2 snap judgment: fun movie, better than Iron Man 3/Thor 2. Great for comic fans! #fb

#### Olympus Has Fallen (2013)

<time>[2014-05-03 22:32] </time> Now watching: Olympus Has Fallen

#### X-Men: Days of Future Past

<time>[2014-05-23 21:44] </time> Watched X-Men: Days of Future Past at [Trinoma](/locations/4c4aedb15609c9b6c1bc6490).

<time>[2014-05-24, 00:55]</time> As an X-Men fan, I really liked Days of Future Past. Bryan Singer set out to correct the mistakes of the past (literally), and he delivered, and the payoff at the end was great. This was the X-Men movie we deserved! Here, have some more X-Men:

> Old Charles said some stuff to young Charles that I liked, it started something like "It's the greatest gift that we have, to bear the pain without breaking, ..." does anyone remember the rest of it.

> Great movie! It's the X-Men movie we deserve!

Nitpicks from group chats:

- Will the white house really fit inside a baseball stadium?!? Tt was an impressive scene, but I disbelieve that a baseball stadium is that big.
- The other problem with the movie was that if Mystique got captured after killing Trask, then x1 and x2 couldn't have happened.

#### Edge of Tomorrow (2014)

<time>[2014-06-07 23:53] </time> Just watched Savescumming the movie...er, I mean Edge of Tomorrow. Fun movie, but the last 3 minutes made no sense

<time>[2014-06-08 01:15]</time> It would be great if they made a sequel to Edge of Tomorrow and it starts with Tom Cruise dying of old age in a hospital, then after that it's the exact same movie #livedierepeat

#### Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014)

<time>[2014-07-16 20:29] </time> I'm at [Pizza Hut Bistro (Quezon City, Metro Manila)](/locations/4d26f5213c79548191f0bf9b)

<time>[2014-07-17 00:19]</time> Just finished watching Planet of the Apes. Bakit wala si Bardagol and Matsutsu?

#### Guardians of the Galaxy (2014)

<time>[2014-08-01 01:12] </time> <time>[Jul 31, 2015 21:21]</time> Watched Guardians of the Galaxy. Aaaah aaaah aaaah hooked on a feeling

Guardians was a very funny and fun movie, but it's hard to say best Marvel movie so far, since I really liked Winter Soldier. And as a comic fan, I'm not that fond of how the Nova Corps was portrayed; I guess it's understandable since they're not the heroes here. There's a lot of stuff for comic fans to enjoy though

#### Rurouni Kenshin: Kyoto Inferno (2014)

<time>[2014-08-21 15:31] </time> I'm dissapointed! But let's see what happens in the third one

#### Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends (2014)

<time>[2014-09-24 21:50] </time>

Watched Rurouni Kenshin: The Legend Ends @ [Ayala Malls TriNoma Cinemas M4 Level TriNoma](/locations/4c4aedb15609c9b6c1bc6490)

I'm still disappointed!

#### Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014)

<time>[2014-11-01 07:12] </time> Just saw Age of Extinction. As an 80s Transformers fan, it's very disconcerting whenever Optimus Prime says something like "I'll kill you!"

Missed opportunity to call it Trans4mers

#### Interstellar (2014)

<time>[2014-11-10 00:51] </time> <time>[Nov 19, 2014 21:32]</time> Watched Interstellar at Cinema 4 The Block, [SM North](/locations/4b49d6ddf964a520697426e3)

Interstellar spoiler-free review: Entertaining movie if you have a good suspension of disbelief and accept the science at face value. Some of the science and timelines are questionable (or maybe I missed some details possibly because I was talking Doctor Who with someone at the same time - some things might clear up on rewatch). Most of the black hole and relativity stuff was well-executed though. The twist at the end I could pretty much spot coming a mile away. CASE and TARS are very entertaining; I wouldn't recommend the movie to my mother, for pretty much the same reasons I wouldn't recommend Inception. Interstellar might be harder to grasp than Inception overall. Explores themes of relativity and human loneliness. Some surprise actors appeared! Very much a Nolan movie

#### Big Hero 6 (2014)

<time>[2014-11-18 00:16] </time> Big Hero 6 spoiler-free review: Fun, light-hearted feel-good romp. Lots of good physical comedy with Baymax. Predictable plot (hey, it's a kid's movie, k?). There is a post-credits scene for some reason.
