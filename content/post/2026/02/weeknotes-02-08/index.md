### The World

- USPol: Still more Epstein files drama, Vance getting booed at the Winter Olympics, Trump being openly racist, etc. Not much new I guess.
- Locally: Impeachments mostly.

### My Week

- Had some routine labs done as prep for an upcoming regular check-up. Also went back to the dermatologist for follow-up on the bacterial infection thing I had on my foot; he says it's healing nicely and I shouldn't need to come back unless something else pops up so that's good.
- Linux usage is going well, except I am running out of space on my ext4 partition and when I went back in to Windows to try to shrink some of my NTFS partitions so I could make a new secondary ext4 partition, but Windows refuses to shrink them! Sigh. A little bit tempted to just nuke Windows 11 outright lol.
- Some archival work etc. Some of the archival tools I find are kind of interesting, maybe I should write an informative blog post about them.
- On the blog: Nothing extra this week.

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing: Hogfather (Discworld #20). Not a lot of progress this week though.
- Comics: Still trying to catch up (or keep up?).
- Feed reader backlog: After accidentally clearing my feed reader backlog, I am happy to report it is currently at a healthy 30 items unread as of this writing. It's the sort of thing that can just suddenly explode if I ignore it though! 

#### Watching

- Started: **The Lincoln Lawyer S4**. This just dropped and I'm already almost at the end!
- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2**, **Abbott Elementary S5**, **The Pitt S2**.
- Movies: No new movies watched this week. Not all the way through at least.
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: **Lorwyn Eclipsed** quick drafts are okay. I am enjoying the format though my win rate isn't super great (not unusual). I am overdue for a set recap for the Avatar set though.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3**. Close to finishing the **Blood and Wine** main quest already, and also trying to grind out the last few achievements as well. I can maybe finish all of it this coming week or the week after at the latest.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

For the past week (Sunday to Saturday), Google Fit tells me I walked 69,209 steps! I just barely missed the 70k target since I ran out of time Saturday. 

Still a bit cold these days, and even some light rain every so often.

### Site Updates

- Only 4 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)

### Looking Forward

Going in for a regular checkup this coming week; I hope there aren't any more surprises from my recent routine labs.
