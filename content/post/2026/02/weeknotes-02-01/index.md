### The World

- It is February. The world, it still turns.
- USPol: Epstein files, Melania documentary, winter, government shutdown etc.
- RIP [Kai Budde](https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/remembering-kai-budde), GOAT of the MTG pro tour.
- RIP Catherine O'Hara

### My Week

- Luckily we were able to find a new part-time helper quickly enough. The challenge with having a new person come over the house though is always that initial period when you aren't sure yet how trustworthy the person is. Sure, you can interview them to make a judgment, but that's not always reliable. Hopefully it works out.
- Had a chill week thankfully, though I did still have to pass by the hospital again once, but this time only to get some documentation we need for a future thing.
- Celebrated nephew#3's birthday last night with the fam.
- Linux usage has been going well; in fact, I only booted into Windows once during the past week or so, and then only just to check my command history! It feels like [I switched to Linux at a particularly opportune time too](/2026/01/115960157168763909/). I'll probably do a follow-up post about the Linux adventure towards the end of Feb maybe.
- On the blog: I shared some [gaming-related puzzles from 2011](/2026/01/game-titles-puzzles-2011/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Started: Hogfather (Discworld #20). Always easy to start a Discworld book since they're short!
- Ongoing: Kind of falling behind on the comics again.
- Feed reader backlog: Well, yesterday I was adding some new blogs to the feed reader and at some point I meant to "Mark as read" the new feeds but then accidentally did that for EVERYTHING instead. After realizing what I had done and maybe a moment of shock, I shrugged and said "Well, I guess I don't have a backlog anymore." Kind of appropriate because earlier in the day I had [shared on the linkblog a post](/2026/01/098de8ff5770ddc03630bddfc08d83ec/) about how you DONT have to worry about your feed reader's unread count!

#### Watching

- Finished: **Fringe**. Finally! Now I can start watching other things lol. There are soooo many other things I wanna watch!
- Started: **The Pitt S2**
- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2**, **Abbott Elementary S5**, 
- Movies: Still no new movies yet watched this year! Although I did rewatch part of *Return of the King*, mostly because of a Reddit thread saying the charge of the rohirrim was one of the best movie scenes of all time. It was a good choice; I started just before the beacons were lit and verbally cheered when Gandalf and Pippin were facing down a Nazgul at Minis Tirith and the horn bellowed announcing the arrival of Rohan. I ended up watching all the way to the end of the Battle of Pelennor Fields!
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Waited for the new month before I could start drafting again.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
- Single-player games: 
    - Started and Finished: **Disco Elysium: The Final Cut**. I played this game for like [3 days in 2020](/2020/09/1301222471568297984/), and I had forgotten how thoroughly engrossing it was until now. The Final Cut makes it much much better, and the game also plays well on the Steam Deck. I finished the second run in a week, but I am still far from achievement completion. I want to write a (re-)review, but I may do another run or two first just to asses how much harder completion would be.
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3**. Finished the **Heart of Stone** main quest! At this rate, I figure I can be done with the game in Feb. (Though there are rumors of additional content coming out in prep for Witcher 4!)
- Speaking of the Steam Deck: I went through the process for installing [EmuDeck](https://www.emudeck.com/). It was very complicated, and a lot of the articles seemed out of date. I actually couldn't get through it until I tried watching [a Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1JwSQMINnU). I mostly did this so I could try playing [the old saves I recovered from my NDS last year](/2025/05/nds-games/). (As if I didn't already have enough games to play!)

### Walking and Health and the Weather

For the past week (Sunday to Saturday), Google Fit tells me I walked 60,704 steps! Didn't hit the target on 3 different days, mostly because of having to stay at home to watch the house.

The days have been getting hotter, though the nights are still a bit cold.

### Site Updates

- I worked my way through a backlog of saved notes to bring you 9 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)

### Looking Forward

Wow, it's February! Time still moves way too quickly. Feb is always a busy month for our fam because a lot of the members have birthdays this month. 

Nothing too stressful yet on the horizon, hopefully that sticks. There are some things I want to get done. (There are always many things I want to get done!)
