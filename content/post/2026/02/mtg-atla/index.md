New set has been out for a while on Arena, so here's my overdue recap for the previous set **Avatar: The Last Airbender**.

<!--more-->

### Flavor / Mechanics / Universes Beyond

- One thing I noticed about universes beyond properties like this is it also inspires conversations with fans who are also people who used to play Magic, even a long time ago. The person who introduced me to MTG back in high school ended up collecting the Final Fantasy set because he was a big fan. He didn't end up playing again, but he didn't mind spending to collect to cards (and I even got some of his duplicates!). For Avatar, it led to some discussions and nostalgia about the show in another friend group, as I showed them the previews and new cards as they came out and we all enjoyed how well the flavor of the show was conveyed. Even friends who never played Magic would ask things like "Oh, is there a card for [this character]?" and so on. I think Universes Beyond may be expanding not just the player base, but just general public awareness of the game in general, at least among other fandoms.
- As mentioned, flavorwise the set is great. The use of the 4 elemental "bending" mechanics is great too, and the execution feels very appropriate for each mechanic. 
- The one aesthetic fail has to be the use of actual screencaps from the show as artwork for the bonus sheet cards. Just like the Final Fantasy implementation, they are annoyingly hard to read.
- I loved that they brought back Lessons without the Learn mechanic, showing us what a different execution looks like, and most likely will synergize well with the upcoming Strixhaven revisit later this year.
- Also nice to have allies and shrines back, though they feel a bit less impactful than their last appearances. 

### Limited Summary / Notes

- I enjoyed limited for this set, but once again my win rate is horrendous and I just barely managed to finish with a flat 50% win rate.
- The set feels very good to play, lots of synergies and so on. Still a lot of annoying bombs though.
- Overall the set mechanics were fun, though the draft archetypes were a bit boring - nothing too revolutionary here.
- I'm surprised that black turns out to be my winningest color here. But without a doubt my favorite color to play for this limited season was blue - this is reflected in playing blue in 21 out of 31 events that I played. I loved the lessons, the card drawing, the use of waterbending, 3mv Katara (lol), etc. Also more than once I was able to mill out opponents with {{% card %}}Master Pakku{{% /card %}}!
- I especially loved WU early in the season, but it felt like it got harder to win with later on.
- The format leans aggressive, it's important to have a lot of two drops!
- I always forget about the {{% card %}}Octopus Form{{% /card %}}.
- It's fun to airbend a {{% card %}}Benevolent River Spirit{{% /card %}}.
- Why doesn't {{% card %}}Scroll of Waterbending{{% /card %}} have waterbending?!?
- Since my win rate wasn't great I was always running low on resources and was at almost nothing by the end of the season.
- I love splashing things, so you bet I tried 4c/5c shrines more than once! I don't have stats for that though, but I will note my "with splash" win rate is signifcantly higher!

### 7-x Draft Decks

### Constructed Notes

- No mythic this season.
- Standard: The Vivi/cauldron combo banning plus the introduction of the ATLA set basically did a soft rotation for standard, with another Izzet deck emerging as the clear winner - Izzet Lessons! I played this deck for a while in Standard; it's fairly skill-testing and can be fun, but after a while I got tired of Standard because there were just so many Izzet mirrors!
- Pioneer: My go to grinding format for when I was tired of everything else is Pioneer. Mostly because the format somehow remains mostly static. I have a Rakdos Demons deck that I've been running in Pioneer forever, and I just fall back to it when I am not having any luck elsewhere.

### Other Stuff

- During December, Arena had a set of winter achievements available only for a limited time. You had to do various winter-related tasks (winning with a snow commander in brawl, winning with N elves in your deck etc) and doing all of them would earn you cosmetics. I don't really use cosmetics, but I am just a sucker for achievements so I wasted way too much time grinding these out.
