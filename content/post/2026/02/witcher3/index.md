I first bought and played through the Witcher 3 back in 2015 on the PS4. At that time I wasn't doing my schtick of wanting to write reviews for every game I played, so instead I have added [a back-dated post](/2015/07/witcher3/) to the blog to contain the content from the PS4 version (social media posts, screenshots, videos, pictures). Back then I did not have time to do completion for the game either, as I was travelling out to another country for a few months on a work trip. I never did get back to the PS4 version.

In 2021, I re-bought the game on Steam, this time the GOTY version which is nice since I never did get around to playing the expansions on PS4. Avid Steam gamers wouldn't be surprised at this, but buying the GOTY edition on Steam cost me much less than what it would have cost to buy the PS4 DLCs at their lowest sale price, so I did not mind the re-purchase.

### The Wild Hunt

I did have to play through the main quest again though, this time on the hardest difficulty for achievement purposes. The difficulty wasn't too bad; I just couldn't get too careless around fights especially if there were a lot of opponents.

I never wrote a review for the PS4 version, so I'll cover this here: the game is fantastic. The setting, the story, the quests are all excellent. 

The open world is MASSIVE; even after having finished all the main quests there are still numerous secondary quests and treasure hunts I haven't done and many, many "points of interest" on the open world to explore. I especially appreciated the wide variety of "monster hunt" quests where you often even have to negotiate your pay and investigate the monster to find out it's weaknesses and how to approach the battle. It really pulls you into the role of Geralt of Rivia as a Witcher. 

The main quests are great and there is some excellent storytelling in there and each one can have different outcomes depending on your actions, who you side with etc. (I think I went the same paths between the PS4 and Steam playthroughs though.) The *Bloody Baron*, one of the earlier available main quests, remains a highlight and one of my favorite examples of excellent storytelling in games.

The graphics hold up well, considering the game is more than 10 years old at this point (though I am honestly not too impressed with graphical advances in gaming since 2015 anyway). Some utterly gorgeous landscapes in there.

The one negative about the game is that the combat system. The camera can be challenging during a fight, the controls can be finnicky (especially for rapidly switching between tools) and it isn't super deep and can get repetitive. This is unsurprising, since they are limited by the abilities of the main character from the books; they can't suddenly turn him into a powerful sorcerer or a stealth archer or whatever. Combat is primarily swordplay, supported by potions, bombs, crossbows and a limited selection of spells ("Signs"). It's not uninteresting, but not the game's best feature.

And of course, there is the in-universe card game *Gwent*, which turned out to be so popular they made it into a separate spin-off card game (sadly it did not do so well). I'm a sucker for this kind of thing (reaching all the way back to FF8's *Triple Triad*), so I definitely enjoyed Gwent a lot.

I finished the main game in May 2023, and did not resume to do the two expansions until December 2025!

### Heart of Stone

Heart of Stone is the first and smaller expansion. It adds a bunch of quests and mechanics, and the main quest has you getting involved in the shenanigans of a mysterious and powerful entity. The quest lines are fairly interesting and introduce more Witcher lore and have Geralt doing some unusual things (enjoying a party, planning a heist, etc).

### Blood and Wine

Blood and Wine is the second expansion and it is much larger in scope and is most likely the better of the two. It introduces a new location, the Duchy of Toussaint, which is very French-coded. The citizens of the area place a high value on chivalry and their chief industry is wine-making so many of the in-game locations are vineyards. The new area is quite large; I think it is smaller than Novograd+Velen but larger than Skellige. Toussaint is also a much more colorful region that the typically drab hues in Novograd+Velen or the dark and stormy Skellige Isles. It's a welcome change in tone from the base game areas!

The main quest for this area involves solving a series of murders, one that Geralt eventually unravels into a deeper mystery and ends in a very challenging boss fight (but only if you get the good ending!).

### Stats and Completion

- Playtime: 122.4 hours (somehow I have way less hours logged here than on the PS4 version!)
- Achievements: 78/78

One of goals for this run was to finally hit achievement completion on this game, more than 10 years since I first played it! Mission success, though some of those last achievements were a bit grindy, but at least nothing glitched out on me. A good number of the Heart of Stone / Blood and Wine main quest achievements were missable though, so I ended up having to look them up ahead of time to make sure I don't miss anything.

### What's Next

The universe of the Witcher is interesting to say the least, so I am looking forward to eventually revisiting it. *Witcher 4* is already in development over at CDProjekt Red, but it's not scheduled to come out until 2027 at the earliest, and IDK if I'd get it at launch so it may be a while before I get back into this universe, unless the rumored new Witcher 3 DLC (to promote Witcher 4) comes out. I played through [Witcher 2 back in 2022](/2022/08/witcher2/) but am unlikely to play through the first game. I watched the [first two seasons of the Netflix show](/02/tv-bobafett-witcher2-murderville/), but IDK if I want to watch the rest, especially since Henry Cavill got recast. I am also a bit interested in maybe reading through the books at some point, though IDK if the English translations are good as they were originally written in Polish.
