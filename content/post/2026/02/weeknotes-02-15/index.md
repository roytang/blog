### The World

- Winter olypmics!
- USPol: Trump being dumb yada yada. THE DOW IS OVER 50,000!
- Locally: Duterte ICC case advances, BongGo and Bato implicated, Senator Padilla being an idiot, etc.

### My Week

- Regular check-up went fine, no major issues, though my cholesterol is still a bit bad and my uric acid went up. Kind of disappointed that recent diet changes did not improve the situation. (Admittedly they were just small changes.)
- Had some time to go wandering around the nearby mall this past week because I wanted to look for some tech stuff. Doing my walking in the malls is nice because of the air-conditioning. I kind of miss the days when I was working in Ortigas and would be walking through a mall during my commute home on an almost daily basis. Although these days the malls are more boring for me mainly because I don't buy a lot of stuff anymore. 
- My trip to the mall yielded this UGreen USB switch (pictured below). Some friends had recommended it as a USB hub because previously I was using a cheap USB hub that often failed to power my external hard drives. I set it up and it works great, except I had trouble at first because the switch lights imply Input 1 is on the left but it was vice versa. Definitely a [PEBKAC error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_error#PEBKAC/PEBCAK/PICNIC), but the UX could have been better!

- Linux stuff: Still going well. Set up some new partitions, did some backups, freed up some space, installed some new programs etc. The new USB hub helped!
- Had an issue with my server and found out that it ran out of disk space! After some checking I found that my database backup files were huge. I determined the problem was `silk`, a django add-on I had installed for diagnostic reasons a long while back. Apparently it had accumulated so many logs in its sql tables and that was using up a bunch of space. I disabled it and uninstalled it and dropped the database tables and re-generated the backups, and now my server is back at a healthy amount of free space. I already think I'm paying too much for my Digital Ocean hosting so I'd rather not have to upgrade the disk!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing: Hogfather (Discworld #20). Progressing very slowly, but at a better pace than the last Discworld book I think.
- Comics: Still trying to catch up (or keep up?).
- Feed reader backlog: Feed reader is at 70 unread items as of this writing. Still relatively healthy, but slowly inching upwards.

#### Watching

- Started Watching: **Wonder Man**. Slow-rolling this one, at most one episode a day.
- Finished: **The Lincoln Lawyer S4**. 
- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2**, **Abbott Elementary S5** (you know what, I'm watching so much stuff and this is fine but kinda meh so I might drop it), **The Pitt S2** (still very good and the episode I am most looking forward to every week).
- Movies: My first movie watched this year was an animated one: [One Piece Film: Strong World (2009)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/one-piece-film-strong-world/). There's a bunch of these OP films on NF and I don't think I've seen any of them before so I'll go through over time.
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: **Lorwyn Eclipsed** first quick draft cycle is done. Am doing a bit better compared to ATLA. The next set is already coming out in a few weeks though; this year's seven-set schedule seems brutal.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
    - **Street Fighter 6**: Trying to rank up Honda.
- Single-player games: 
    - Finished: **Witcher 3**!! Review linked above.
- Others: Someone lent me a PS5! I have no intention of spending any more money on PS games though, so I'm waiting to borrow a PS5 game or two from someone else. In the meantime, I tried installing SF6 since I already had a PS4 disc for it. After downloading a huge update that took the better part of a day I sat down hoping I could putz around online a bit and then realized I actually needed PS+ to do that. Jeez, I'm so spoilt by PC gaming, how did I tolerate this kind of thing back in the day? Disappointed, I uninstalled SF6 and instead played a bit of my Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age from 2018; I finished the game back then but left so much undone for completion.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

For the past week (Sunday to Saturday), Google Fit tells me I walked 63,149 steps! I fell short on Friday and Saturday.

### Site Updates

- A healthy 9 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)
- Updated some older blog posts.
- Some new albums added to [the collections area](/collections/albums/):
    - Screenshot albums for the Witcher 3 - [Steam](/collections/albums/witcher3-steam/) and [PS4](/collections/albums/witcher3-ps4/)
    - Screenshot album for [Street Fighter V](/collections/albums/sfv/)


### Looking Forward

- Tuesday is Chinese New Year. Wednesday is Ash Wednesday.
- Trivia team hasn't attended a quiz night in a few months; we hope to remedy that this coming week.
- No pending medical stuff this week thankfully. We could use a break.
- We will be busy with family stuff next weekend, so most likely next week's weeknotes will be a bit late.
