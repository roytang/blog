Finished reading *Soul Music*, Discworld book #16. I like the idea of Susan as a character; she's a good addition to the lore. But I had a lot of trouble with this book, took me forever to get through. Typically for a Discworld book I'll start slowly then around the halfway point I start to just blitz through the pages to find out what happens. For this one, I just didn't care that much, so it was kind of a slog and I really only picked it up when I was waiting somewhere and the mobile internet was bad. Buddy and his band were certainly amusing and I still enjoyed many of the one-off gags (see the quote above), but I never felt too invested in the overall plot. I think the trouble was that this book felt like a mishmash of two similar previous books: [Reaper Man](/2024/01/reaper-man/)'s "Death goes on a holiday" story, mixed with [Moving Pictures](/2023/07/moving-pictures/)' "modern art form acts as a magical force imposing its will on the Discworld" vibe, and it just all didn't come together for me in an interesting enough way.

Also, I'm not sure what the point of the Wizards subplot here was, they don't seem to have done anything of particular importance or usefulness.

This brings me to [22/41 Discworld](/page/discworld/) books read!
