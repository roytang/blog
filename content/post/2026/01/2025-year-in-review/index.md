This is a personal year in review. You can check the [yearnotes tag](/tags/yearnotes) for previous years-in-review. Last year's review is [here](/2025/01/2024-year-in-review/).

### The World in 2025. 2025

- Donald Trump's first term as US president was marked by on-and-off tariff wars, aggressive (and sometimes illegal) anti-immigrant activties, a lot of rambling speeches, threats to annex Greenland, attacks on Iran and Venezuela, upending geopolitics, an extended government shutdown, Epstein files coverups, etc. On the upside, he did somehow manage to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza. The Russian invasion of Ukraine continues unabated despite his best efforts though.
- Musk's bromance with Trump led to him leading government cuts through his "DOGE" department, though they later had a rift and he had to go.
- Paramount has cancelled Colbert's Late Show and Kimmel was briefly suspended from ABC.
- NYC elected their first Muslim mayor!
- Former president Duterte arrested and flown to the Hague to stand trial at the ICC.
- We have a new pope! He is Pope Leo XIV.
- Local midterm elections were held this year! I forgot that was just this year. Somehow feels like it was so long ago.
- Nintendo has released the Switch 2! I have no interest in it yet.
- The tech world continues to revolve around genAI hype (thanks, I hate it).
- Local news revolved around things like the failed impeachment of the VP, a provincial mayor who turned out to be a Chinese citizen, flood control corruption anomalies and the resulting investigations, Senate leadership unheaval, devastating typhoons and earthquakes, etc etc. Predictably, no big fish (i.e. senators or congressmen) have yet been jailed in light of the corruption investigations.
- RIP: Pope Francis, Michelle Trachtenberg, Gene Hackman, Peter David, local lich/politician Juan Ponce Enrile.

### My 2025

The first couple of months of the year were very stressful for me. The rest of it was a lot more chill, with spikes of worry and anxiety here and there, but nothing too major. 

#### Medical

At the start of the year, we had to rush Patient #3 to the hospital; I spent a good chunk of January and February at the hospital and otherwise helping with her medical needs. Early this year, [Patient #3 passed away](/2025/02/inevitable/). It was a difficult time.

Patient #1 and Patient #2 are doing a bit better than last year; we certainly had way less emergency runs to the hospital for them this year.

In the second half of the year, an immediate family member (someone I grew up with) unexpectedly had a cardiac episode and had to have an emergency stent put in. We were all quite surprised as he is younger than me and very active/healthy. His recovery went well. Quite the wake-up call.

Late in the year, I underwent some tests to figure out some weird symptoms that came out during routine tests. We have ruled out a bunch of things (including cancer, a big relief), but the mystery persists into 2026.

#### Household

With the loss of Patient #3, there are now only 3 of us in the household, which means it is primarily me supporting the 2 seniors. While we were eventually able to find a helper to come in a couple of days a week to help with chores, I have found myself needing to step up more with a lot of household work: dishes, laundry, unclogging the toilet, and I've kind of taking up cooking! Nothing too serious, as I still have physical weaknesses making it difficult to cook more complex dishes. Mostly breakfast stuff: frying meats, scrambled eggs, fried rice, that sort of thing. And I have been experimenting with different kinds of simple pasta dishes, because I love pasta. My Youtube algorithm now likes recommending the occasional cooking video. 

This past NYE, I cooked spaghetti aglio olio for our media noche (they say it was good!):

{{% photos aglio %}}

We've lived in this house for more than 25 years now, and its age is really starting to show; we needed to have repairs done on small things several times throughout the year.

#### Finances and Work

Financially, 2025 expenses were a bit less than 60% of 2024's. This is unsurprising, given that we had much less medical worries for most of the year compared to the previous one and that Patient#1 is no longer undergoing chemotherapy. I also had no foreign travel this year. My one biggest single expense of the year was the Steam Deck!

Professionally, this was another hiatus year for me, same as last year. That is the fifth one in a row! I had resolved earlier in the year to start looking for work already, even part time, but I kept putting it off, mostly because I am still very much annoyed at the state and trends in the industry. Happily, I am still in a pretty good position savings-wise, so I am still in no hurry to get work. My anxiety keeps telling me to start looking already while I am in that good position though, so I am once again hoping to get some income in 2026.

#### Website Stuff

I [deployed some big updates to this site in August](/2025/08/aug2025-site-updates/), mostly with the intention of helping alleviate the heavy server load brought upon by the plague of scraper bots. Sigh.

#### Some Events

- Niece #5 was born! Likely the last *pamangkin* for me.
- I bought a Steam Deck!

#### Other Things

Honestly, I think for the later half of the year I was mostly checked out and spent a lot of time on gaming, movies, tv shows, books and comics (see below). 

### 2025 Goals

In [last year's checklist post](/2025/01/2025-checklist/), I set some goals for myself for 2025, let's see how I did (spoiler: not very well):

    - Had a lot of trouble with Sanderson's [Wind and Truth](/2025/08/wind-and-truth/), that took me forever to get through.

    - [Here's the list](/lists/media/tv/#2025) of all the TV shows I've written about in 2025.
        - I watched A LOT of shows this year; 35 shows in 2025, from 25 in 2024. A lot of them were very good! 
        - Some favorites for 2025:
            - [Penguin (2024)](/2025/04/movies-tv-1q/#penguin)

    - [The Complete Marvel Run](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run): Currently up to 17.25%, from 14.54% last year. Progress remains slow. The bottleneck is the writing, not the reading.
    - For current comics, some quick recommendations:
    - The DC Absolute and Marvel Ultimate lines have been great. The new Batman by Matt Fraction is refreshing.
    - For non-Marvel/DC comics, my favorites this year were:
        - the Energon Universe comics from Skybound particularly Transformers and Void Rivals. 
        - Dandadan remains very good.
- **Music**
    - 2025 was a weak year for music. My music listening is still way down.
    - My Spotify Wrapped tells me I only listened to 770 minutes of music in 2025, around the same as 2024. Also, instead of listening to newer music, I seem to have regressed and just listened to even older music:
        {{< photos spotify >}}
    - My [Last FM recap](https://www.last.fm/user/roytang/listening-report/year) is slightly more interesting, though it should also be using my spotify as a data source so IDK what's up with that (I think I was mostly listening to the COE33 soundtrack in December after spotify data was already locked in): 
        {{< photos lastfm >}}
    - Music tracks played (Spotify/LastFM): 307 (391 last year). 
    - Youtube only logged 751 minutes of music in 2025, from 1454 in 2024:
        {{< photos youtubemusic >}}
    - I have a [listening stats page](/page/stats/listening/), but I still don't know yet how to format it for the combined spotify/youtube data lol.

#### Gaming

I did my gaming writeup separately and ahead of time this year: [My 2025 Gaming Roundup](/2026/01/2025-gaming-roundup/).

#### Trivia Team

- In 2025, we attended 14 [quiz nights](/collections/quiznights/), down from 16 last year. 
- Win rate: 5 wins, much worse than last year's 50% win rate!
- By host:
    - AboutQuiz: 6
    - PopQuiz: 7
    - Pisay Batch Y2K: 1
- NYT puzzles:
    - Crosswords: As of today, my current streak is at 371. Still a ways away from the record 1014 streak!
    - Connections: Current streak: 17. Max streak: 37. Win%: 87.
- The Trivia Team has a YT channel, [@teamcamoteph](https://www.youtube.com/@teamcamoteph) where we upload recordings of the our trivia shenanigans and other gaming and puzzle things. However, we only uploaded 10 videos in 2025, down from 54 in 2024. Life got in the way of our online get-togethers.

#### Food

- [Food stats page](/page/stats/food/)

#### Others

- Steps/Activity:
    - Year total: 3,026,531, down from 3,222,672 steps in 2024. That's an average of 8,291 steps per day. I slacked off a little bit in the middle of the year, but that's not too bad.
- Weight: Around the start of the year we got a digital weighing scale at home, which means I have been able to track my weight more regularly. I am happy to report that I have lost around 15 pounds / 6.8kg (more or less) since last year, which is fantasic. I remain overweight, but this is my lowest recorded weight since before 2011!

- Weddings attended: 1, from 0 last year

    - Food delivery: 6, up from 4 last year. 
- Bears defeated in single combat: 0
- Tips received via [my profile on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/roytang): None this year. I'll still accept donations happily!

### The future

For me, the year in review post is about the past year. Early next week I expect to post my 2026 checklist, where I talk about the future and things I'm looking forward to in the coming year.
