### The World

Maybe I'll avoid world news this week, it's a bit depressing.

### My Week

- Some surprises this week that made it busier than expected! Some additional tests that needed to be done because of incidental findings in earlier tests (worrying and expensive and once again they had trouble drawing my blood) and also had to suddenly help someone out by going with them to the hospital overnight (nothing major, just diagnostic stuff, I didn't really do anything except be there). I have gotten most of my test results back already and thankfully they look okay, though we shall see what the doctor says.
- I spent some time working on [setting up Linux dual boot on my desktop](/2026/01/115890485872188737/)! (This is one of [my 2026 goals](/2026/01/2026-checklist/#my-specific-goals)!) The dual boot is already working, thankfully I did not screw up my Windows partition. There is still some effort to be spent before the Linux side is good enough to be a daily driver though. I might write more about the effort this coming week.
- On the blog: Nothing extra!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): Almost done!
    - Comics: Still catching up!
- Feed reader backlog: 673 items as of this writing, slightly more than last week. Really should consider trimming the feeds list, I am just barely keeping this count from exploding.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2**, **Abbott Elementary S5**, **Fringe** (finished season 3 already!)
- Movies: No new movies yet watched this year. Honestly Fringe is taking so much of my watching time!
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Avatar draft season is done and new set drops this coming week. My win rate has been terrible.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
    - **Street Fighter 6**: Playing on and off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3**. Still doing **Blood and Wine** but also started **Heart of Stone** already.
    - Started: **Banner Saga 2**. I finished the first game a while back. These games feel great on the Steam Deck!

### Walking and Health and the Weather

For the past week (Sunday to Saturday), Google Fit tells me I walked 60,372 steps! Friday to Saturday were short because I had to stay somewhere overnight. 

The weather has been a bit chilly, but I think not as much as previous Amihan seasons, and I think it's starting to get hotter again, way too soon as usual.

### Site Updates

- No new entries on [the link blog](/links/). I really should get around to them though.

### Looking Forward

- New MTG set Lorwyn Eclipsed drops this coming week on Arena!
