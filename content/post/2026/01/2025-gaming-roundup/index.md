title: My 2025 Gaming Roundup
toc: true
---

It is a new year! I am kicking it off with my personal 2025 gaming roundup! Previously: [my 2024 gaming roundup](/2024/12/2024-gaming-roundup/). 


### Overall

- Games "finished" (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete OR played a bunch of multiplayer on): 15, up from 8 last year.
    - **Megaman Legacy Collection** should probably count for this one, but I am not yet done, so it gets arbitrarily counted next year instead.
    - By genre: 7 RPGs, a platformer, a metroidvania, a puzzle game, a beat-em-up, 2 action/adventure games, 2 roguelites
    - By platform: 10 (!!) on PC game pass, 5 on Steam
    - 8 indie games! (We are counting Clair Obscur~!) It was a great year for indie games!
    - [The list](/lists/media/games/#2025). See the games per platform below.
- Overall a fantastic year for gaming:
    - On average the quality of the games I did play has been very good
    - I played a number of new games that I hadn't been expecting to play (mostly thanks to Game Pass)
    - Finally got FF16 out of the way
    - I even managed to knock a game off the "older releases I want to play" list from [the 2025 checklist](/2025/01/2025-checklist/#games)! 
- My total overall gaming time is also probably around 33% higher than last year! Part of that is because the real world sucks so honestly we all needed a bit more escapism probably.
- My favorite games I played this year:
    - **Clair Obscur: Expedition 33** was a fantastic surprise
    - **Silksong** was very challenging
    - **Blue Prince** drove me a little insane
 
### Gaming Spend

- My overall gaming spend is UP around 350% from last year! This was mostly because I decided to treat myself to a Steam Deck, which was roughly 86% of the gaming spend for the year. Without the Steam deck, my actual expenses on games were down 50%!
- I made less purchases this year: 8 items total vs 11 last year.
    - Steam purchases:
        - Rise of Ix expansion for Dune Imperium
        - Final Fantasy XVI
        - Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy (still unplayed)
        - Marvel's Midnight Suns (still unplayed)
        - Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales
        - Immortality Expansion for Dune Imperium
        - Fighting EX Layer (was super cheap!!)
        - Transformers Battlegrounds (was super cheap AND was going to be delisted)

### Stats by Platform

#### PC - Steam

- Total playtime for 2024: 1943.88 hrs (!!), massively up from last year. 
    - This number is massively inflated by [Bongo Cat](http://store.steampowered.com/app/3419430/), which is really less of a game than a toy that runs whenever my desktop runs, which explains the play time. Without Bongo Cat, the number drops to around 400 hrs, only a little bit less than last year's total.
- Games "finished": 5
    - [Final Fantasy XVI](/2025/09/final-fantasy-xvi/) (53.15 hours played)
    - [Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales](/2025/04/miles-morales/) (21.47 hours played)
    - [Ducktales Remastered](/2025/02/ducktales-remastered/)
    - [Sunderfolk](/2025/10/sunderfolk/)
    - [Children of Morta](/2025/12/children-of-morta/)
- Other most played games for 2025:
    - Marvel Snap, which [I have now quit](/2025/12/quit-snap/):  (88.45 hours played)
    - Dune Imperium: Played weekly with my regular gaming group. No review written as yet!  (52.48 hours played)
    - [Root](/2021/05/root/): (49.60 hours played)
- Other games:
    - Fighting games: **Street Fighter 6** is at achievement completion! I have been playing it on and off, most recently via Steam Deck, but I have not yet written a review.
    - I am not big on hero shooters, but this year I also played a bit of **Marvel Rivals**. That Marvel IP really makes it easy to get me to try a game!

#### PC - XBox Game Pass

PC Game Pass was very good to me this year, letting me play a number of new releases, more than my Steam playtime even. I even had to skip out on some new releases I wanted to play like Outer Worlds 2 and Oblivison Remastered simply because I had too much to play.

- Total playtime for 2025: 468.08h, more than double from last year!
- Games "finished": 10
    - [Indiana Jones and the Great Circle](/2025/01/indiana-jones-great-circle/)
    - [Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector](/2025/02/citizen-sleeper-2/)
    - [Dungeons of Hinterberg](/2025/02/hinterberg/)
    - [Avowed](/2025/04/avowed/)
    - [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](/2025/06/clair-obscur-expedition-33/)
    - [Blue Prince](/2025/07/blue-prince/)
    - [Hollow Knight: Silksong](/2025/10/silksong/)
    - [BALL X PIT](/2025/10/ballxpit/)
    - [Metaphor: ReFantazio](/2025/11/metaphor/)
    - [Marvel Cosmic Invasion](/2025/12/cosmic-invasion/)

XBox did not give me a year in review this year! However, TrueAchievements did:

The stats for Silksong there are skewed, because for some reason the XBox app on PC does not properly detect when I have quit the game!

#### Nintendo Switch

- Total playtime for 2024: Trivial

I did not spend any significant amount of time on the Switch this year; my nephews/nieces might have used my Switch quite a bit though. Nintendo's year in review has apparently been delayed to January (logical!), so I'll find out when that comes out.

#### CCGs

- [Magic The Gathering](/tags/mtg/)
    - [My MTG Stats](/page/stats/mtg/)
    - [Magic Arena](/tags/magicarena) did not give me any end of year stats this year.
        - Still completely free to play this year!
    - Set recaps for the year:
        - [Foundations](/2025/02/mtg-foundations/)
        - [Aetherdrift](/2025/04/mtg-aetherdrift/)
        - [Tarkir Dragonstorm](/2025/06/mtg-dragonstorm/)
        - [Final Fantasy](/2025/08/mtg-final-fantasy/)
        - [Edge of Eternities](/2025/09/mtg-edge/)
        - [Spider-Man / Through the Omenpaths](/2025/11/mtg-spiderman-om1/)
    - Overall a fantastic year for MTG on Arena. Final Fantasy was a fantastic set and I played so so so many drafts. Aetherdrift and EOE werea great limited environment and I did well there. Tarkir was fun though my win rate was horrendous. Spider-Man/Omenpaths are a low point, but hopefully one they can recover from.
- [Marvel Snap](/tags/marvel-snap): I have quit the game.    
- [Eternal](/tags/eternalcardgame): Spent a bunch of time towards the end of year to complete all the Steam achievements and all the weekly Chapters! At first I was thinking that once I accomplished that goal I would quit the game and uninstall and such, but I think I'll keep playing it a while longer (no promises as to the frequency).

#### Twitch

(Not really a gaming platform, but seemed relevant)

- streamed on 8 separate days, for a total streaming time of 20 hours, around 20% down from last year. I wasn't really that into it this year.
- currently at 38 followers, down by 1 from last year. Not surprising.

Here are my Twitch recap stats, both as a viewer and as a streamer:

### Games I Did Not Play

#### Civilization VII

Was actually looking forward to this one, but reviews were so bad and the price was so high I just didn't go for it. Might reconsider when the first big expansion comes out.

### The Steam Deck 

So my big gaming purchase this year was the Steam Deck. Overall very happy with the purchase. It's super convenient even at home; I usually have it on the table right beside my bed so I can take my turns in Root/Dune/whatever or play a bit of Street Fighter 6 or something, all without getting out of bed. And of course it's handy whenever I know I'm going to be out of the house and maybe waiting somewhere for an extended period.

Cons are that it's very much bulkier than the Switch and will not fit in my [everyday carry bag](/2023/11/everyday-carry/), so I usually need the much bigger backpack if I need the Deck. Oh and also I need to reinstall Magic Arena every so often, but I've found I can live with that.

### Game Pass and the Future

Aside from the convenience, one of the reasons I wanted to try the Deck was that I am considering switching away from Windows to Linux, mostly because I'm not happy with Microsoft's latest AI-focused plans. The Steam Deck lets me preview how well that will work for gaming, which is my #1 concern. And it works pretty well! I very rarely play those FPS multiplayer games that require anticheat stuff not available on Linux, so that's not an issue for me.

To that end, I am also planning to unsubscribe from Game Pass. It's been fun, but it's time to go. I won't have access to the games from Linux, and with the latest price increase, the value of the sub starts to become questionable. Even if Game Pass lets me play the latest releases, I typically play very long games, so each release costs like 2-3 months worth of subscription price. At that price, I'd rather wait for the game to go on Steam sale and not have to think about whether it no longer becomes available after some time. 

Besides, my Steam backlog is still very very large. As of today, it says I have 389/583 unplayed games in my library. I don't expect to be able to make a significant dent in that count anytime soon, but with Game Pass out of the way and the Steam Deck convenience, I hope to slowly chip away at it. I also don't have any significant releases that I really want to play in 2026, so I expect to be playing older games in the near future! (And hopefully spending much less money too!)
