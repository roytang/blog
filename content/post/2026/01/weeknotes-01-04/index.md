First weeknotes of the new year!

### Start the Year Right, Kidnap a Foreign Leader

Maybe mildly annoyed that this "new year" thing was taking attention away from him, yesterday DJT decided to hijack our news feeds by invading Venezuela and abducting their president Maduro to stand trial in New York. Now Maduro isn't a good guy, but it still can't be good for any semblance of "international rules-based order" that the US military is once again willy-nilly inserting itself into other supposedly sovereign nations, this time without even the pretense of congressional authority. What a way to set the tone for 2026. Also if they could do that all along, why not do Putin first? His crimes against humanity are much worse than whatever Maduro has been indicted with? (Oil. The reason is oil.) Also, if my long history of watching lawyer shows is any indication, any defense attorney worth his salt can get an arrest thrown out on the littlest procedural flaw by the police, how is this any different? Wouldn't Maduro's lawyers just argue the arrest wasn't valid or such? I guess we'll find out.

### My Week

- Unfortunately I spent the early parts of the week suffering through an upset stomach (I ate so many different kinds of food on Christmas week I'm not sure what the culprit was), and started developing coughs and colds as well.
- The week was not as busy as it was, with the only celebration being NYE media noche. 
- We had a family friend over to join us for media noche! I cooked spaghetti aglio olio! I am always hesitant to cook for other people, but it seems this turned out good. Also, I think there were a bit more fireworks this year compared to previous years.
- The rest of the week was end of month/year activities: cleaning up, paying bills, archival stuff, writing blog posts!
- On the blog: [a review of Marvel Cosmic Invasion](https://roytang.net/2025/12/cosmic-invasion/), [my final movies/TV reviews for 2025](https://roytang.net/2025/12/movies-tv-nov-dec-2025/), [my gaming roundup for 2025](https://roytang.net/2026/01/2025-gaming-roundup/), and finally [my 2025 year in review](https://roytang.net/2026/01/2025-year-in-review/). Whew!

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): No progress this week.
    - Comics: Still quite behind. I am caught up with the Ultimate Universe and X-Men: Age of Revelation though. (One of those is better than the other!)
- Feed reader backlog: 668 items as of this writing. I was hoping I would be able to cut that down a good amount before the year transitions but the opposite has happened!

#### Watching

- Started: **Fringe**. This was one of those 2000s sci-fi shows I never got around to watching so I was glad when it finally became available on streaming over here; I've heard good things about it!
- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2** (currently on midseason break)
- Movies: Early last week I watched [One Battle After Another (2025)](https://letterboxd.com/hungryroy/film/one-battle-after-another/), my last new movie of the year!
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Back to doing poorly at Avatar quick drafts!
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
    - **Street Fighter 6**: Playing on and off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3: Blood and Wine**. Very little progress this past week. Will get back into it soon I hope.
    - Ongoing: **Megaman Legacy Collection** - Finished Megaman 6, 1 and 2! Now all that's left are the challenges, though I don't know if I have it in me to do all of them, there are a lot!
    - Started: **Marvel Cosmic Invasion**. Finished the campaign with some friends! Wrote a review, it is linked above.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

As mentioned above, I was suffering through an upset stomach for a good part of the week, and developed some coughs and colds due to the chilly weather. The stomach problem made it risky to go out on longer walks, and later in the week it was quite rainy as well. Both of these meant my step count was very low this past week. Google Fit tells me I walked a mere 35,433 steps over the past week (Sunday to Saturday)! Not a great start to the year, but hopefully we can get those numbers up.

### Site Updates

- 2 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)
- When I did the big static website update back in August, I initially didn't include the notes archive, which meant they were no longer publicly available for a while. My worry was that it would take too long to generate the files since there were a lot, but after some testing I have now added back the [notes archive](/notes/).

### Looking Forward

I have one last "year end" post to write, and that's my checklist for 2026. This one usually helps me think through and figure out my plans for the year so hopefully after writing that I have a better idea of how I want/hope 2026 will look for me.

Also, I might go in for medical stuff this week.
