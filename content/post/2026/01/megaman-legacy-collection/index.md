This is a collection of the first six Megaman games, all originally on the NES. Of these six, I only finished three back in the day, so I eventually wanted to play through all of them. 

I started playing this one back in 2020 *and* already had a draft blog post review up with some commentary which I will copy-paste below. I only finished Megaman 1 and 2 back in 2020. In 2025/2026 I played through 3, 4, 5, and 6 via the Steam Deck. Then I found out there were no cloud saves and I needed to play through 1 and 2 again to get the "finish all six games" achievement!

Game by Game Notes:

### Megaman 1

Quoted parts were written in 2020: 

> From memory, this was definitely the hardest of the first generation of Megaman games. A lot of QoL features that made the later games a lot easier were not yet available, like passwords and E-Tanks. The drop rate for powerups was quite low. The bonus item, the Magnet beam was missable - you had to repeat Elec Man stage if you didn't get it on first pass. Also, it had this behavior where enemies and powerups despawned as soon as they left the visible area of the screen. (Later games would have a bit of leeway for this.)
> 
> At first I tried playing it straight through and had a lot of difficulty even getting through Cut Man and Elec Man stages, and after that I'm too tired/frustrated to continue. I don't have my 1990s reflexes anymore, so there's a lot of frustration and retrying. I complain to some gamer friends that the worst thing about Megaman 1 is that you have to be able to do everything in one sitting since there's no password saves. They wisely pointed out that the Legacy Collection should have save states, and they were right! Game-changer! At the very least, it lets me save my progress, and for very difficult spots, there's save-scumming. I'm old and slow, I will forgive myself for save-scumming in this Nintendo hard game.

I lol'ed a bit at reading the paragraph above, since the re-play went much more smoothly since I already knew about the save states (though I think I wasn't *too* abusive.)

> For my full run, I start with GutsMan first, followed by Cut Man, Elec Man, Ice Man, Fire Man, and finally Bomb Man. This order lets me avoid repeating Elec Man to get the Magnet Beam. 

I believe the recommended boss order is actually: Cut Man, Elec Man, IceMan, Fire Man, Bomb Man, and Guts Man at the end. This does require repeating the Elec Man stage, but its what I did on my second run on the Steam Deck because Cut Man is a way easier boss than Guts Man. Back during the NES days, I think we also prefered this order mostly because the Guts Man stage was very annoying with the moving platforms that suddenly drop you. (If you do it later, you can magnet beam to get across.) Also, this is the order the robot masters appear in when you have to re-fight them in the Wily stages, so I think this order is the more recommended one.

> Next are the Wily base sections. The most difficult single boss in the game is the one from the first Wily base section: the Cyclops/Yellow Devil. I recorded [my last few attempts against this boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWhBlrGiK8), but I must have had around 30-40 attempts even before this video. You can see the savescumming in this video!

I swear it didn't take me that many attempts on the Steam Deck run!

> The most difficult sequence in the game however is the succession of four robot masters you have to fight right before Wily. They come in the order Bomb Man - Ice Man - Fire Man - Guts Man. Since this is Megaman 1, there are no health refills in-between, otherwise it would be much more manageable. It takes me a while, and a lot of savescumming, but I finally manage to push through just barely, then proceed to die once I get to Wily. I only had like 1/7th HP left at that point, so there was no point savescumming. Luckily, the game lets me start over right outside the Wily door. I remember that I have to use Fire and Elec weapons. It takes me two tries to beat the final boss. Woo!

I also wrote [a short review of this game in 2023](/2023/05/nes-games/#4-rockman-famicom) as part of my "finished NES games" post.

Intermission: After finishing Megaman 1, I try some of the challenges. Some of them are manageable, some will take a lot of practice to earn gold medals. We'll see if I bother with trophy completion for this game.

### Megaman 2

In 2020:

> I start with Bubble Man, and right off the bat I can see how much easier this game is, mostly due to the much more generous powerup drop rate. I even manage to pick up a couple of 1UPs along the way. I die a few times to miscontrolled jumps into the spike ceilings, but otherwise there's no issue. Bubble Man himself was easily defeated.

That's where the 2020 draft ended lol. I did start with Bubble Man again during my Steam Deck run, mostly because he's the easiest boss to beat without weapons I think. But I think most guides will recommend a boss order similar to: Metal, Wood, Bubble, Air, Crash, Heat, Flash, Quick. Starting with Metal makes sense because it's super useful and flexible and actually works well against 3 other robot masters.

This game introduces: passwords, E-Tanks, and support items.

After having played all 6 games, I think Megaman 2 remains my favorite among them. The bosses are great, the weapons are fun, the Heat weapon is a much more powerful version of what would eventually become the Mega Buster, plus the Crash Man stage music remains my all-time favorite.

### Megaman 3

This game introduced the slide move (I love it, though I accidentally trigger it a lot) and Rush! Rush replaces the support units from the previous game and gives you more movement options, though Rush Marine is just a dumber Rush Jet. This game also introduces the supporting character Proto Man!

Recommend boss order: Loop 1 - Snake Man, Gemini Man, Needle Man. Loop 2 - Magnet Man, Hard Man, Top Man, Shadow Man, Spark Man.

The bosses in each loop cycle around in terms of weaknesses. I think all 3 in loop one can be beaten easily (or not easily) with just the default Mega Buster weapon, though I think back in the day we always started with Needle Man. For my Steam Deck run I started with Snake Man.

After the eight robot master stages, there are also four "Doc Robot" stages which are remixes of the first 8 stages, but with each one having 2 "Doc Robot" enemies that mimic the robot masters from Megaman 2!

Of note is that during the Wily stages, one of the boss robots has a sequel for the first time: Yellow Devil Mk 2! He was quite a bit easier since you have E-Tanks.

I also wrote [a short review of this game in 2023](/2023/05/nes-games/#6-rockman-3-famicom) as part of my "finished NES games" post. The game feels much tougher without the exploit mentioned in that review!

### Megaman 4

This game appears on [my really old "list of games finished" file](https://roytang.net/archives/ancient/topcities2002/works/games.txt), but listed as SNES instead of NES, so it really should have been included in the ["finished NES games" post](https://roytang.net/2023/05/nes-games/)!

This game introduced the chargeable Mega Buster Cannon! Always fun. It also introduced Eddie, who gives you a powerup in the middle of some stages. Whenever Eddie appears, you can avoid getting the item he gives and reset him by exiting and re-entering the room until he gives you an E-Tank.

Recommended boss order: Toad, Bright, Pharoah, Ring, Dust, Skull, Dive, Drill.

I do remember a good number of these bosses and stages, though the final stages not so much, so I suspect that even if I did finish this back in the day, it was a "one and done' and I never repeated it again. 

I'm not sure I liked the stages in this one. "Pharoah Man" doesn't feel very ancient Egypt at all though! I think the Dust Man stage felt the most evocative, it really felt like being in a garbage disposal lol. Also, some of the weapons felt recycled: Pharoah Man's Flash Stopper is a modified Flash Man time stop, and Skull Man's Barrier is basically the same as Wood Man's Leaf Shield!

In this second trilogy (Megaman 4-6), instead of Dr. Wily always directly being the culprit, the games started out with a "fake villain", but the mastermind is eventually revealed to be Dr. Wily anyway! Feels like an excuse to pad the game with a second final boss castle lol. For Megaman 4, the "fake villain" is Dr. Cossack, whose daughter Dr. Wily kidnapped to force his cooperation.

### Megaman 5

I guess this is the first game of the set that I didn't finish back in the day, though I have some recollection of some of the stages like Gravity Man's, so I suspect we rented it for a bit (there used to be a shop near our old house that let us rent NES games) but not enough to finish it.

The recommended boss order is: Gravity, Gyro, Crystal, Napalm, Stone, Charge, Wave, Star.

I did enjoy Gravity Man's stage because I felt they were playing around with their engine a bit with the sections that changed the stage's gravity. Charge Man's Charge Kick is a weird weapon that triggers when you slide, I wondered a bit why the shoot button wasn't doing anything! Star Man's Star Crash is yet another Wood Man Leaf Shield variant.

This game introduces Beat! He's a helpful bird friend. To unlock him, you need to collect one letter in each of the 8 robot master stages; together the letters spell out MEGAMANV.

The "fake villain" in this game is Proto Man! It is eventually revealed that it was one of Wily's robots in disguise, big surprise.

I remember noting to myself while playing through it that this game had the hardest robot masters and end bosses in the collection!

### Megaman 6

This is the first one I have no real memory of. The recommended boss order is Flame Man, Blizzard Man, Plant Man, Tomahawak Man, Yamato Man, Knight Man, Centaur Man, Wind Man. 

A couple of these robot masters seem to be based on stereotypes lol. Flame Man is even wearing a turban and Tomahawk Man has a Native American headdress! And Blizzard man appears to be wearing... a santa hat? Centaur Man is just weird, I don't get that stage/boss concept at all. The Plant Man weapon is yet another Leaf Shield variant! None of the stages seemed particularly memorable though.

The stages here have some branching paths where different powerups can be acquired. Beat can be unlocked again, but only with 4 letters this time (BEAT). 

### Challenges and Completion

Achievements for this game mainly involved completing all six games (DONE!) and completing a LARGE number of challenges. I think there are 50 in total, and you have to beat the earlier ones to unlock the later ones. Each challenge is basically a time attack composed of segments and bosses from the 6 games, sometimes mixed and match among each other. You don't get the benefit of save-scumming this time though! This is how I know I am capable of beating the Yellow Devil in a single attempt! Each challenge has time targets for unlocking a bronze, silver, or gold medal, and the time limit for gold medals are super tight and will require maximizing the use of your tools and such.

I tried doing a few of the challenges before giving up and realizing I don't have the patience to complete these! So I am quitting this game for now, with 11/24 achievements done and 23.2h of playtime.

Overall, the game was a fine purchase, especially if you were a fan of the series from back in the day. In theory I could have just played through these with an emulator, but I think I got this Steam copy super cheap off a bundle, so at least I get some achievements lol.

### Other Megaman Games

There is a [2nd Legacy Collection on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/495050/Mega_Man_Legacy_Collection_2/), which includes games 7 to 11 I think. The 12th game doesn't release until 2027, so that gives me some time to get that collection and work through those eventually I guess? There is also [a Megaman X collection](https://store.steampowered.com/app/743890/Mega_Man_X_Legacy_Collection/)! Some games to consider in the future, maybe if they appear in a bundle.
