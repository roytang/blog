### The World

It has been a week.

The US threatened Greenland, then backed away from the threat of force, presumably because the bond markets disapproved. Trump claims that a "framework for a deal" has been reached but no one has any details. Then he proceeded to piss off the allies some more by downplaying (insulting) their military contributions in places like Afghanistan.

Also, Trump has named himself lifetime head of a "Board of Peace" that will oversee Gaza rehab and seems aimed at eventually replacing the United Nations. However, nations joining the BOP have to pay a BILLION DOLLARS. France has declined the invite, and Trump disinvited Canada after their PM basically called the US out and outshone him at Davos. I think it's basically mainly autocratic governments that have accepted invitations to join so far.

Those are just the geopolitical concerns! The US also has a lot of BS happening domestically as they continue the descent into fascism, even as I write this.

### My Week

- Our part-time helper suddenly quit on us this past week, which means I had to take a bunch more household chores again (laundry, cleaning, etc). Kinda sad and annoying at the same time, as we basically had no warning she was unhappy with us. And finding a new helper is a bit of a struggle these days.
- My medical issues are mostly fine, all the tests I took previously ruled out a bunch of things. But one of my doctors wants me to take an expensive MRI to rule out some things that may turn out to be nothing. He says it's not urgent as of yet, so I've pushed back a bit and said I'll see if I can get it done in a few months. (Basically punting the decision to future me!)
- I also acquired a new doctor - a dermatologist, mostly because I've had a weird bump on my foot for a few months now. Turns out it was a bacterial infection (I didn't know they could last that long). I'm just glad it didn't turn out to be anything more serious.
- Patient #1 also had some tests done, but they seem mostly fine.
- At least I have been a productive on some of my hobby projects and archival work like scanning old photos.
- On the blog: [wrote about returning to Linux](/2026/01/return-to-linux/) and [wrote a review of Soul Music](/2026/01/soul-music/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Finished: Soul Music (Discworld #16). Review linked above.
- Ongoing:
    - Comics: Still catching up! One of the big problems with the [complete Marvel run project](/blog/tags/complete-marvel-run/) is that I am reading far more than I am able to write about, and I have been using the blog posts to track my progress. To help, I've also started a "Comics Reading Log" spreadsheet, we'll see how that goes.
- Feed reader backlog: 732 items as of this writing, slightly more than last week. Still a problem.

#### Watching

- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2**, **Abbott Elementary S5**, **Fringe** (finished season 4 already! That means 13 episodes remain, and then I can finally focus on watching other things again lol)
- Movies: No new movies yet watched this year. 
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Actually spent some money on Arena this past week since ATLA sapped my resources. However, my first few drafts of Lorwyn Eclipsed have been fun but went poorly.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
    - **Street Fighter 6**: Playing on and off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3**. Still doing **Heart of Stone** and **Blood and Wine**, though not a lot this past week.
    - Finished: **Banner Saga 2**. The run is short (unsurprising), and the ending was a pretty annoying cliffhanger. I will probably play at least one more run, but I may step away from the game for a bit first.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

For the past week (Sunday to Saturday), Google Fit tells me I walked 64,930 steps! It's not 70k, but it's slightly better than last week so I'll take it.

The weather has been mostly pleasant during the day and very cold during the night, so it seems we still have the amihan with us after all.

### Site Updates

- 7 new links shared via the [linkblog](/links/)

### Looking Forward

- I am looking forward to the first week of the year where I don't have any medical stuff to have done (fingers crossed that doesn't change!)
- I think Wonder Man also drops on Disney+ this coming week.
