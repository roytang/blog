First full week of 2026! TWENTY-TWENTY-SIX! Still feels a bit weird to say.

### The World

The US continues its descent into full-on fascism and imperialism, with the gestapo (ICE) shooting down an unarmed (white!) woman for (checks notes) driving her car. Following the whole "abducting a foreign leader" last week, senior officials have also been reasserting the threat to take Greenland, by force if necessary. DJT himself claims that international law means nothing to him, and that only his "own morality" can stop him. I'm not convinced he has that - the US federal government right now seems to be projecting a "might is right" philosophy and that superpowers can do whatever they want. If Trump can take Greenland by force (effectively ending NATO), then there's no real reason Putin can't take Ukraine and Xi Jinping can't take Taiwan is there? It feels like we are rapidly accelerating towards some kind of global geopolitical realignment, one not necessarily good for the majority.

### My Week

- Mostly a chill week. And kind of productive for my personal / archival projects. A decent start to the year I think.
- I did have to go to the hospital last Friday for more tests. They had to put a hep lock on me and that's always a big hassle, but otherwise things went smoothly.
- On the blog: [my checklist post for 2026](/2026/01/2026-checklist/), and [a review of Megaman Legacy Collection](/2026/01/megaman-legacy-collection/).

### Media Diet

#### Reading

- Ongoing:
    - Soul Music (Discworld #16): This book is very short, but I am still only 60% done. I really only read it when I'm someplace with no cell signal lol.
    - Comics: Catching up a bit. I read a Punisher v2 story arc that wasn't on MU and when it ended I found out why and it was ridiculous and I look forward to writing about it eventually.
- Feed reader backlog: 649 items as of this writing. Having trouble getting this number down!

#### Watching

- Started: **Abbott Elementary S5**. I hadn't realized a new season already started last October!
- Ongoing: **Fallout S2**, **High Potential S2**, **Fringe** (finished season 2 already!)
- Movies: No new movies yet watched this year.
  
#### Gaming

- Regular ongoing live-service games: 
    - **Magic Arena**: Apparently Avatar quick drafts are available an extra week, which is good because I ran out of gold and am still trying to earn enough gems to get the mastery pass lol.
    - **Eternal Card Game**: Just regular grinding etc.
    - **Street Fighter 6**: Playing on and off.
- Single-player games: 
    - Ongoing: **Witcher 3**. Got back into it this weekend. I kind of made the mistake of doing **Blood and Wine** before **Heart of Stone** though.
    - Finished: **Megaman Legacy Collection** - Review linked above.
- Other stuff: 
    - There was another [Games Done Quick](https://gamesdonequick.com/) marathon, I enjoyed watching a few of the runs throughout the week.
    - My weekend gaming group is a bit annoyed that I have won the last 4 [Root](/2021/05/root/) games lol.

### Walking and Health and the Weather

Happily, my stomach has stabilized and my coughs and colds also seem to have dissipated so that's nice. The weather has been mostly pleasant with some rains here and there. I have been hoping to find some time to go walk around the University - [early January is always a good time for that](/2020/01/saturday-morning-up/) - but I haven't had the opportunity yet.

For the past week (Sunday to Saturday), Google Fit tells me I walked 70,211 steps! A strong start that makes meeting the same standard for the rest of the year challenging lol.

### Site Updates

- No new entries on [the link blog](/links/). I do have some links saved up that I just hadn't gotten around to processing and sharing.
- Nothing this week, mostly updates to the private local archive version of the site.

### Looking Forward

Still haven't started the new season of The Pitt, and there are a couple of new series this coming week I also wanna watch.

Gonna see the doctor this week after I get my test results. Looking forward to a long time in the waiting room. Hopefully we solve the mystery soon so my brain can focus on other things, like working on my 2026 goals!
