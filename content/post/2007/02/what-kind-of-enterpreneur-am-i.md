Entrepreneurial strengths:

* comfortable with the abstract

* obsession with new technology

Entrepreneurial weaknesses:

* expertise tends to be quite narrow

* difficulty with people

* personality may not be forceful enough to lead

* problems you may want to solve may not have a significant market
