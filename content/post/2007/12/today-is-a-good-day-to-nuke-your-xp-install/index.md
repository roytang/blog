title: Today is a good day to nuke your XP install

I'm not sure why I keep trying to get the Ubuntu + XP dual boot thing working. I don't really need it, I can do most of the things I want to do in XP. And I can't really play games in Ubuntu (I don't really want to bother with all the crap Wine puts you through). Still, every so often I'm hit with some sort of geek envy where I just want to have an Ubuntu installation handy so I can try out some cool stuff like Compiz or whatnot. After all, I can enjoy both worlds with a dual boot -- I can always go back to XP when I feel like it.

Yeah, well not if I somehow manage to screw up such that XP refuses to read from my NTFS drives. See [this thread ][1]for all the sordid details. Long story short, I'm stuck with Ubuntu again for a while.

Or at least until I get the craving for Civ 4 again.
