The official title is quite long. Actually, the English Title for _Gyakuten Saiban 3_ is even worse!

Ace Attorney is an awesome series, I finally got around to playing the second game since the third one is scheduled for an English NDS release in September. I started playing the day I arrived in HK -- so I beat the game in six days.

Justice for All is a more difficult game than the original, putting the title character in more difficult situations, and making it a lot more tedious to &#8216;cheat' with the save file. The first 3 cases were not that tough -- I beat one per day. But the last case, I actually got stuck at one point and had to "cheat" with an FAQ.

I'm looking forward to the third game, where I hear you get to defend... Phoenix Wright!
