I took a longish survey at the [Authentic Happiness ][1]website. (Registration required.) I list my results here for my future reference.

_Your Top Strength: Judgment, critical thinking, and open-mindedness_ 
  
Thinking things through and examining them from all sides are important aspects of who you are. You do not jump to conclusions, and you rely only on solid evidence to make your decisions. You are able to change your mind.

_Your Second Strength: Creativity, ingenuity, and originality_ 
  
Thinking of new ways to do things is a crucial part of who you are. You are never content with doing something the conventional way if a better way is possible.

_Your Third Strength: Fairness, equity, and justice_ 
  
Treating all people fairly is one of your abiding principles. You do not let your personal feelings bias your decisions about other people. You give everyone a chance.

_Your Fourth Strength: Forgiveness and mercy_ 
  
You forgive those who have done you wrong. You always give people a second chance. Your guiding principle is mercy and not revenge.

_Your Fifth Strength: Bravery and valor_ 
  
You are a courageous person who does not shrink from threat, challenge, difficulty, or pain. You speak up for what is right even if there is opposition. You act on your convictions.

I'm amused by how the first and second strengths are a bit in opposite directions. Same for the third and fourth. I'm a living contradiction.
