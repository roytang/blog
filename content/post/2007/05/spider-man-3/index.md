Pretty good movie, as expected. The story is what you'd expect from a comic-book movie, but the mid-air fight scenes are really great.

The whole Sandman thing is basically fluff, the movie could have been done without him. He was like a cheap pop to make the whole "dark side" thing easier to start off, but then they had trouble resolving his story. It's not like he's a major Spidey villain anyway. Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom... that would have been good enough for a trilogy of Spidey movies, all the major bad guys covered.

J. Jonah Jameson is funny as always. It's hard to take Topher Grace seriously when I keep thinking of him as Eric Foreman. Some of the drama parts are a bit over the top, but The funny bits of the movie are pretty good. The ending is a bit lame though.

I don't think I made any spoilers. Unless you didn't already know Sandman and Venom would be there.
