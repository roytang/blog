I'm going to try out a new feed aggregator for a while -- [NewsHutch][1]. Don't get me wrong, [Bloglines][2] is nice and all, but one gets tired of the UI after a while. NewsHutch looks&#8230;nice.

And don't get me started on Google Reader&#8230;that one is slow as molasses. (I added it to my Google Customized Homepage though, maybe that makes it better)
