I'm going to try out a new feed aggregator for a while -- [NewsHutch][1]. Don't get me wrong, [Bloglines][2] is nice and all, but one gets tired of the UI after a while. NewsHutch looks... nice.

And don't get me started on Google Reader... that one is slow as molasses. (I added it to my Google Customized Homepage though, maybe that makes it better)
