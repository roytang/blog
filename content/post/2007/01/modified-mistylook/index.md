The original isÂ [here][1]. Yeah, I didn't like the header image so I removed it.

I'm tired of moving themes around, so I'll settle on this for a while. Simple and clean. I'll just fuss around with the plugins later.

And yeah, I'm also changing the categories around. There should be a plugin to search posts and assign multiple posts to new categories at the same time.

My vacation time is almost up... I still have too many things to watch...
