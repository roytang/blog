This year, I resolve to find more direction.

That being said, I'm kind of behind already. I usually manage a total cleanup of all the stuff in my room before the New Year. This year? Not even close.

At least I have an additional 3 weeks of vacation to finish everything.

Review ofÂ [last year's resolution][1]:

"I will try more new things this year" : I'd say that's a resounding success. Especially with the trip to Hong Kong, I think I ate more new food there than I have during the past five years or so.

Yay for me.
