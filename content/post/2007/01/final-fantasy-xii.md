Wow. It took me three months to finish FF12!

Fun game, weak story.

No strong lead character to carry the game.

Gameplay is very MMORPG-like. The grinding was ok, but they could've done some quests like WoW to make it better.

I'll fight the optional bosses someday.

Will I play the next FF game? Don't know. Time is the most difficult factor, as it demands a lot. Took me about 65 hours to finish this one, playing 3-4 hours a day after I came back from Hong Kong. I don't think that's a feasible schedule once work starts up again.
