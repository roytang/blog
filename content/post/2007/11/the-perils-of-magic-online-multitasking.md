My single greatest problem with Magic Online is the fact that it's on a computer. Which means that unlike a real draft where I can focus 100% on the draft, in Magic Online I could possibly be doing several other things such as coding, blogging, random surfing, IM, etc. that may cause terrible misclicks such as a first-pick Faultgrinder (true story)

I should stop writing this post now and maybe try to salvage the draft.
