I still have no idea what to play for Lorwyn Standard, so I was eagerly awaiting this year's States/Champs results. There are already partial results up at MTG.com, and I had some time so I did some of my programming hocus-pocus and extracted some fun data. [States / Champs 2007 Card Counts][1] 

The data is of course extracted from top eight decklists, so what we have here are literally the best decks this past weekend. Some interesting things to note:
 
  


  * Gaddock Teeg, or the lack thereof. 
  * More Tarmagoyfs than mountains! (Although adding snow-covered mountains puts the red land back on top.) 
  * Planeswalkers, from most to least: Garruk, Chandra, Liliana, Jace, Ajani 
  * Best common creature: Llanowar Elves 
  * Best uncommon creature: Shriekmaw 
  * Best rare creature: Tarmogoyf 


   
I like this data gathering thing, maybe more later.
