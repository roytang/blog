Mostly due to my antisocial nature and my laziness, I haven't actually seen a movie in a theater since... forever. I broke that fast mostly because of the hype surround 300, the movie based on Frank Miller's comic book retelling of the Battle at Thermopylae.

Everyone who's seen the movie has the same thing to say: it's really good. So I went to see it with a brother of mine. And it was good. Really good. The highlights of the movie are the very impressive battle scenes (which is like 90% of the movie), with awesome usage of slow-motion to enhance the battle drama. It feels like a video game!

Unfortunately, I think the movie was hyped a bit too much for me. It's good, but not OMGWTFThat'sAwesome!!!111 good for me. History lessons told me how that battle ended, and some of the lines in the movie sound like trash-talk from WWE shows.

Still enjoyable though, despite the high theater prices nowadays. It's just that I went in expecting my socks to get knocked off; they rolled up a bit, but they stayed on my feet.
