Lorwyn prerelease in two days, and of course MTG Salvation is [spoiler-complete][1].  Some thoughts on cards:

**Thoughtseize** 
   
-- 

B

Sorcery (Rare)

Target player reveals his or her hand. Choose a nonland card from it. That player discards that card. You lose 2 life.

**My take:** 
   
Undercosted cards that demand a 2 life payment are usually pretty good. (See: Shocklands, Char, Psionic Blast, Vampiric Tutor). Thoughtseize is widely anticipated to be the chase rare of the set, with starcitygames.com pre-order prices starting at a staggering 17.50 USD. That seems bit too high for a utility spell though, so I'm not going to go out of my way to get them yet. Although I wouldn't mind opening one or two this weekend.

**Incandescent Soulstoke** 
   
-- 

2R

Creature -- Elemental Shaman (Rare)

Other Elemental creatures you control get +1/+1.

{1}{R}, {T}: You may put an Elemental creature card from your hand into play. That creature gains haste until end of turn. Sacrifice it at end of turn.

2/2

**Nova Chaser** 

-- 

3R

Creature -- Elemental Warrior (Rare)

Trample

Champion an Elemental _(When this comes into play, sacrifice it unless you remove another Elemental you control from the game. When this leaves play, return that card to play.)_ 

10/2

**My take:** 
   
The elemental deck almost builds itself. (Most of the tribe decks do, actually) I hope one or both of the above rares are in the precon, that makes 'em easier to get. With the elemental harbinger, I can see a toolbox-type elemental deck that can use various evoke elementals and giants like Nova Chaser to finish 'em off.  Lots of possibilities here actually. Force of Savagery pops in for 9? Pandemonium? Fatal Frenzy? Elementals are hot, and I'm not talking about just the Flamekin.

**Eyes of the Wisent** 
-- 

1G

Tribal Enchantment -- Elemental (Rare)

Whenever an opponent plays a spell during your turn, you may put a 4/4 green Elemental creature token into play.

**My take:** 
   
Is this the end of Draw-Go style decks?!?

**Doran, the Siege Tower** 
-- 

BGW

Legendary Creature -- Treefolk Shaman (Rare)

Each creature assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.

_"Each year that passes rings you inwardly with memory and might. Wield your heart, and the world will tremble."_ 

0/5

**My take:** 
   
I think my jaw literally dropped when this was previewed. Midrange decks will love this guy. Thoughtseize provides disruption, and Doran gives the cheap beats. A "Rock" style deck may be in the offing.

**Vivid Creek** 

Land (Uncommon)

Vivid Creek comes into play tapped with two charge counters on it.

{T}: Add {U} to your mana pool.

{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Creek: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.

**My take:** 

There's a good chance I'd like this land cycle better than the rare ones. I think Gemstone Mine just became stupid. The red one may be the best, as it facilitates a mostly-red elemental deck splashing for various evokers.

**Hoofprint of the Stag** 

-- 

1W

Tribal Enchantment -- Elemental (Rare)

Whenever you draw a card, you may put a hoofprint counter on Hoofprint of the Stag.

{2}{W}, Remove four hoofprint counters from Hoofprint of the Stag: Put a 4/4 white Elemental creature token with flying into play. Play this ability only during your turn.

**My take:** 
   
I don't think it's a tier-one card, but one can't help imagine the mischief created by turn 2 Hoofprint, turn 3 Hoofprint, turn 4 Careful Consideration.

**Goldmeadow Stalwart** 

-- 

W

Creature -- Kithkin Soldier (Uncommon)

As an additional cost to play Goldmeadow Stalwart, reveal a Kithkin card from your hand or pay {3}.

2/2

**My take:** 
   
The comparison to Isamaru is obvious of course, as is the reason the Lions were pulled out of the Core Set. That said, I like the next guy better... 

**Wren's Run Vanquisher** 
-- 

1G

Creature -- Elf Warrior (Uncommon)

As an additional cost to play Wren's Run Vanquisher, reveal an Elf card from your hand or pay {3}.

Deathtouch _(Whenever this creature deals damage to a creature, destroy that creature.)_ 

3/3

**My take:** 
   
I like this better than the red or white equivalents. Face it, if Isamaru were in the same standard as 3/3 for 1G with deathtouch, he might not have been able to swing on turn 2 that often. That being said, I could see a deck with 4 Goldmeadow Stalwart and 4 Wren's Run Vanquishe... that's a lot of speed. And it also puts you in the correct colors for the next card.

**Gaddock Teeg** 
-- 

GW

Legendary Creature -- Kithkin Advisor (Rare)

Noncreature spells with converted mana cost 4 or greater can't be played.

Noncreature spells with {X} in their mana costs can't be played.

_So great is his wisdom and spirit that many who have met him say that they stood before a giant of a man and talked to the wisest of the four winds._ 

2/2

**My take:** 
   
This guy stops Force of Will. Oh and Wrath of God and Damnation. That W/G aggro deck is looking pretty good. Throw in some Changeling effects (to facilitate the Vanquisher and the Stalwart) and you're good to go. Not sure how well such a deck would fare in standard, but Block Constructed seems to be a given.

That's all for today!
