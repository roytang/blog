I wasn't too keen on playing, but that Dark Confidant kept whispering at me to give him one more chance. Rakdos again, except I removed Martyr of Ashes from the board and put in Avalanche Riders to help the terrible Angelfire matchup.

Round 1: 2-1 win vs BWR Slivers

I kept Hit/Run in the main because I thought he had Solifuges, he did not.

Round 2: 2-1 win vs White Weenie

Game 1 was a wipe in his favor, as I had mulled to five. Games two and three I took control.

Round 3: 0-2 loss vs RG Greater Goyf

Terrible matchup. Stupid Goblins keep getting in the way of the Solifuge

Round 4: 1-2 loss vs WRU Angelfire

I could've won off a Demonfire, had he not had the foresight to Fetters the storage land. Where are those Avalanche riders?

Round 5: 0-2 loss vs WRU Angelfire

The deck had one last chance to get one win off an Angelfire deck. No dice. Crovax the Hero is really good against my X/1s.

DROP

Boo. I should never have listened to that Dark Confidant.

Farewell Ravnica. Begone Lightning Helix! Begone Remand! It was fun, but time for something new.

Next week: GPT Bangkok -- Lorwyn Sealed.
