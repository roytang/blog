Some days just don't go very well. You wake up with a mild headache. Your bed demands that you stay just a few minutes longer. Your computer refuses to work correctly. You have no energy. Every task assigned to you seems to be something you'd rather not do. You find out some people hate you. You get drenched in rain on the way home. You arrive home and feel completely useless, thinking you've done nothing today.

I was planning to write about how I had a bad day, but then the above paragraph got out of hand. Exaggerated even. I look at it and "eh, my day wasn't so bad." A little perspective changes everything. (Many of the things in the above paragraph did not happen to me.)
