As a big Transformers fan back in the day, I have to say: the movie is okay. Action-packed and a fun popcorn flick. The story's nothing to win an oscar over, but everything looks SO COOL!

Some questionable things though:

{{< spoiler >}}

- Why does the all-spark only create violent, gun-toting robots? Where the hell did the Autobots come from?
- I don't recall seeing the Decepticon symbol anywhere, was it there?
- How come Soundwave can survive getting his head chopped off, but Jazz can't take being split in half?
  
{{< /spoiler >}}

Hell of a movie.
