title: WMCQ @ Fisher Mall
---

I was running Bant Company. I used [the decklist from this article](https://web.archive.org/web/20161216004959/http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/the-deck-to-beat-this-weekend-bant-company/) as reference, but did not have it exactly due to card availability issues.

Attended WMCQ @ Fisher Mall

Anecdote: Between rounds I was checking my deck and only counted 59 cards and found I was missing a Collected Company! My previous round opponent didn't have it. I saw a vendor I knew and decided to just buy a replacement CoCo. After that I realized I should asked at the judge's table first to see if anyone had turned it in and someone did! I did things in the wrong sequence, so now I have an extra CoCo!
