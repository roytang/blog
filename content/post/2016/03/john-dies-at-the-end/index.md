2016 book #12: John Dies at the End by David Wong. This book is all kinds of weird. It's a bit like the author tried to think of as many weird things as he possible could then ties them together with an impossible plot that he doesn't even fully resolved. It's like the author was on crack while he was writing most of this (apt, since he's apparently and editor at cracked.com). Not for everybody, and at some point your eyes may glaze over at one too many levels of weirdness.
