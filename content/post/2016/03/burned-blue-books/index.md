title: Ashes of burned bluebooks
---

Across the fields as I remember

A missed phone call, a crumpled letter

A dream forgotten in the heat of summer

You dropped the tray and fled the scene

A guilty smirk, I knew that look

Betrayal stings, same now as then

A single stroke was all it took

And you and I parted ways again

Amidst the ashes of burned bluebooks
