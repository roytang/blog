My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1567568113">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
2016 Book #11: The Four Hour Work Week by Tim Ferris. <br /><br />Pros:<br />- useful tips on reducing unnecessary work, remote working, automation, travel tips, etc<br /><br />Cons:<br />- not for anyone who dislikes lying to people or some other form of "salesmanship"<br />- not for anyone who doesn't have an idea for something to sell that can be easily mass-manufactured and distributed to the potential buyers<br />- largely US-centric (especially the resources he links to)<br />- some level of douchebaggery recommended (lying to other people, faking sales, etc)<br />
