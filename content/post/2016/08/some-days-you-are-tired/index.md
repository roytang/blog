Some days you are tired
  
Maybe you are tired of all the work
  
You can't keep up with, it all piles up
  
Of all the meetings and reports
  
That come relentlessly without end

Some days you are tired
  
Maybe you are tired of all the time
  
That you never have enough of
  
Of all the deadlines and targets
  
That you never meet but should've

Some days you are tired
  
Maybe you are tired of the world
  
And how it's unfair and never learns
  
Of all the madness and insanity
  
And sometimes you want to watch it burn

Some days you are tired
  
Maybe you are tired of people
  
And all of their pressure and expectations
  
Of all their lies and inconsistencies
  
Or disappointments in their decisions

And on some other days
  
It's more of the same

But also maybe you see a smile in a child's eyes
  
Or maybe you run into a long-lost friend from years ago
  
Or maybe someone laughs at a stupid joke you said
  
Or maybe you see a stranger help another
  
Or maybe you find a new favorite place to eat
  
Or maybe you solve a problem tearing you up inside
  
Or maybe a familiar tune plays on the radio
  
Or maybe finally you're no longer in the red
  
Or maybe good fortune comes to your brother
  
Or maybe you find some time alone to breathe

And then you remember
  
That it doesn't always go this way
  
That there are also better days

And you say to yourself

"Maybe tomorrow,Â I will not be so tired"
