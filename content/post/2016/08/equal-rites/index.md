My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1724328950">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I bought a used copy of this book a while back and finally decided to read it, it wasn't particularly long. I'd found however, that I'd already read it before lol. Anyway, I still managed to read through it a second time, it was pretty good. I like the Discworld books, they're ridiculous, popcorn fantasy reads, and this one was no exception. However I do believe I should now track which ones I've actually read...
