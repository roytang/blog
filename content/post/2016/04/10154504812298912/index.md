title: 2016 Presidentiables Data
---

As an undecided voter, I still dislike all of the presidential candidates. But although certain friends of mine are strong advocates of abstaining the presidential vote, I am still considering the merits of strategically voting a "least evil" candidate. For this purpose, I've been keeping notes on the Presidentiables. I thought I'd share this for the benefit of other undecided voters. Feel free also to give me additional inputs or points to consider.

Caveats: The Pros/Cons are obviously tailored to my tastes, e.g. if you are pro-Death Penalty then "In favor of death penalty" will be a PRO for you instead of a CON. I didn't bother listing any issues that I feel have been sufficiently answered so far, e.g. the Yolanda funds issue, I feel that the LP has sufficiently answered (at least for now)

(I also have a spreadsheet for the Senatoriables, but really there's so many of them I can't be bothered to take notes on all of them)
