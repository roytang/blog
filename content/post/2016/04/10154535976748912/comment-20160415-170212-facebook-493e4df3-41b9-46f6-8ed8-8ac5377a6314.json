  "text": "Apologies Ryan, Roy for sounding like a grumpy old man. I took this post and the succeeding comments after that to mean that we can look at US crime statistics and freely use it to describe and translate similar policies in a Philippine setting.  After rereading, it's far from that. In fact you believe that Americans generally understand that law and order is an LGU concern, which I seem to feel that is not the case in the Philippines, i.e. when motorists feel entitled to complain to MMDA even when caught red-handed.  As for comparing 1st to 3rd world countries. I do that almost everyday of my life, Singapore vs Philippines, and it isn't mostly fun. In fact, my hand is being forced to cast the vote to an \"authoritarianistic\" ruler because of living in Singapore and seeing/benefitting from the rules effects.  Anyways, as you have implied, crime is just a symptom and the most hyped one in the current political climate.  I'd like to close this discussion with a fun statistical correlation study on how to address crime in the Philippines - legalize abortion (: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect",
