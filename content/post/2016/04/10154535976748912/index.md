title: Comparing crime rates between US and PH
---

I was viewing some speeches by presidential candidates for the US elections and one thing that struck me was that crime / law and order was not an election issue for them (it's never mentioned in the speeches) whereas here people seem to consider it to be really important (I personally don't; I mean, it would be better if there were less crime, but I think we have far more important concerns to address such as poverty, corruption, judicial reform, education, etc). I wondered if the United States had significantly less crime than we do such that it isn't a national concern. So I decided to check out some statistics.

Multiple sites claim that we have a significantly lower overall crime rate (per capita) than the US (Citation: https://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/stats/Crime/Total-crimes-per-1000, https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp). However, it seems that we also have a higher homicide rate than the US (https://knoema.com/atlas/topics/Crime-Statistics/Homicides/Homicide-rate). So we have less crimes overall, but more of them are homicides.

Wala lang. I like data.
