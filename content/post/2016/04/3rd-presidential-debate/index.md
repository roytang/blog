title: Third Presidential Debate
---

Commentary thread for 3rd presidential debate (consolidated).

---

[19:17] Dapat magtaas kamay na lang si Miriam at humingi ng enerhiya sa taong bayan para sa genki dama

---

[19:35] Bakit pa ba umaattend ng debate etong si Binay? Ni hindi sinasagot ang tinatanong sa kanya #PiliPinasDebates2016

---

[19:44] Panalo, quinote si Batman!

---

[20:19] Babawasan mga tax, pero andaming mga planong transportation at libreng healthcare

---

[20:31] Looking forward to the pro roxas crowd posting about davao philheath beneficiaries at 8am tomorrow

---

[20:49] May cinite na stats si duterte na 300,000 new vehicles per month. At that time I was reading a newspaper article which said there 280,000+ vehicles sold all of last year. Fact check?

---

[21:01] Duterte: puro 75 ang grade ko 

Miriam: ang presidente dapat may academic excellence

---

[23:31] In my opinion, the performances at today's debate (from best to worst) were:

1. Roxas
2. Poe
3. Santiago
4. Duterte
5. Binay

The debate wasn't too exciting, although may konting immature fireworks between two certain candidates.

BONUS: In my opinion, the debates (in terms of format and moderator performances) can be ranked (from best to worst) as follows:

1. 2nd debate (TV5)
2. 3rd debate (ABS)
3. 1st debate (GMA)

Edit: Swapped #3 and #4 because my someone reminded me of somethings Miriam said and I remembered that stupid Emilio Aguinaldo reply

---

[Apr 25 02:10] Some other things I noted in the debate:

1. Duterte no longer harping on "3-6 months"
2. Roxas no longer mentioning "Daang Matuwid" (although he did use tuwid as an adjective a couple of times I think)
3. Isko Moreno has *a lot* of ads. He must have had like 3-4 different ads shown during the debate
4. ABS' silly drama scenes before each question were a waste of time better used for asking more questions
5. We LOLed every time Binay took the opportunity to walk forward to answer. Baka kulang pa sya ng exercise for that day
