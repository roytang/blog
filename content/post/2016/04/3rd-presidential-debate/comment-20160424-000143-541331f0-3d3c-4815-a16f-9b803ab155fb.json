Miriam was also a serious choice for me, health isn&#x27;t an issue. Bad trip lang yung BBM connection (although when I talked with my dad and mentioned Du30 his immediate reaction was something along the lines of &quot;kilala mo ba tatay nun?&quot; I believe he was talking about the dad being a Marcos crony? I dunno.)    Just wondering, did she get dull or was it the Big C (and/or the meds)?",
