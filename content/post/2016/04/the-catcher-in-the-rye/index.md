My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1619067255">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This book was painful to read really. I might have received it better had I read it when I was younger, but reading it now, Holden just feels like this whiny entitled angry kid that has no idea what he's doing or how the world works. The story doesn't really go anywhere interesting; I understand that it's not that kind of book, but what it is doesn't really appeal to me too much.
