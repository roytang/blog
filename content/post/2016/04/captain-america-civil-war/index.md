Captain America Civil War spoiler-free review:

- great fight sequences, start to finish
- the newcomers were great, airport big fight sequence had a great surprise (and not the one you already saw in the trailer - although you might have already been spoiled if you pay attention to certain toy lines), although I feel like a couple of the characters were pulled in to the conflict in a way that was a bit weak, but it's still pretty good overall
- the plot was ok. Justification for the civil war was ok. Some surprises. The villain motivation was slightly mediocre, but that wasn't really the focus of the movie anyway
- Martin Freeman's role felt totally superfluous - it did not seem necessary to cast Martin Freeman
- the movie kind of ends with the MCU and the Avengers in a weird place, some people might not like it
- better than: Winter Soldier. The plot kind of develops in the same way but everything is on a much bigger scale now
- there are two post-credit scenes, one in the middle and one at the very end
- Imax worth it? Probably. Not very ostentatious use of 3d, but most of the fight sequences have it. You might get dizzy if you're not used to it
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Maybe, but I'd have to keep explaining who these characters are

My nitpicks were posted [on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/4gubpz/movie_megathread_spoilers_captain_america_civil/d2l1qqy/):

Spidey was great, but TBH it felt a bit random that Tony went back to the US to recruit a kid (he was that desperate?) AND make him a new suit when he only had 36 hours to catch Cap and friends. At least Cap got Hawkeye to do his stateside work, so their flight was only one way :p I feel like they probably had to work the Spidey part into the script after the deal with Sony.

I had known there would be a Giant Man appearance since there was a lego set that spoiled it, but luckily I completely forgot about it and only remembered when Scott said "I've only tried this once in a lab and it almost tore me apart!" Fun moment

When Zemo shows the three guys the video of Bucky taking out Howard and wife, Tony asks Steve "Did you know?" and Steve replies, "I didn't know it was him". What exactly did Steve know? Did he know that Howard and wife were assassinated, but did not know that Bucky was the assassin? If so, how does he know that? These events happened while he was in the ice. My brother thought it meant that Steve knew that Bucky assassinated someone (since Bucky told him about the incident he discussed with Zemo during the blackout), but that Steve did not know it was Howard. But then it wouldn't make sense to reply to Tony that way?

Random: the endings for both Civil War and BvS were both about someone's mother. Okay, not really haha

The Raft: Didn't they also have a Raft in Agents of SHIELD? Then again, the movie guys probably don't care about that show anymore...

During the airport fight sequence, I was expecting someone to switch sides at some point and thought it would be Spidey (since you know, Civil War), but happy to be surprised it was Natasha.

Some minor airport fight nitpicks: after they square off in the middle of the airport they break off into pairs but Vision is conspicuously absent. I don't think he does anything significant until Giant-Man, which is weird given he's the most powerful guy there. Also, at some point Falcon and Bucky ge
