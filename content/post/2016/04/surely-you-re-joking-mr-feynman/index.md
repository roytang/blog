My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1608160555">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
After reading this book, I'm quite envious of Feynman's life haha. He's lived a very interesting life and the stories are told with a general down-to-earth tone despite the fact that he often has to explain the math and theoretical physics which may be less accessible for laymen. For science-oriented people, this may be one of the best biographies to read
