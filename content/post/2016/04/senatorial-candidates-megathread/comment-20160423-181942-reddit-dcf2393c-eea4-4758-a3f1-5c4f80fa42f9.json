  "text": "He's one of those guys who works hard but isn't too noisy, so people don't really have strong opinions about him either way. \n\nHe only really got involved in government service in the 90s, before that it was mostly business.\n\nHis martial law experience (from wikipedia):\n\n> As a son of Marcos' political rival, Osme\u00f1a was imprisoned in 1972. In November 1974, he embarked on a hunger strike along with his cellmate -- ABS-CBN's Eugenio \"Geny\" Lopez, Jr. -- to protest the unjust detention of thousands of innocent Filipinos. This resulted in the release of 1,022 political prisoners in December 1974. Defiant to the very end, Osme\u00f1a and Lopez escaped from their maximum security prison cell in Fort Bonifacio in 1977. This exploit was enacted in the 1995 movie, Eskapo.",
