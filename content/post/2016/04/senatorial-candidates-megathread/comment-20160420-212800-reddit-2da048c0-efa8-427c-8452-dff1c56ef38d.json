He was cleared of it by the SC in 2011 so he was able to return home.\n\nHowever, I think it speaks a bit ill of him that he chose to evade the law until he was cleared. (I guess some would say it's justifiable given our justice system, but as a lawmaker and police officer maybe he should be one of the first to abide by the rules)",
