Netflix is now available in the Philippines! Starting from P370 a month... will try this out soon, let's see if our internet can keep up

Did a quick trial of Netflix PH. I have a 4mbps BayanDSL connection and streaming was ok. Loading time was negligible for a tv episode, around 10-20 seconds for a movie. No buffering or anything encountered so far. Quality is decent (not sure how to tell what the resolution is, it doesn't matter to me) The selection is as expected, kind of limited. Strangely, there is no House of Cards. Works with our Chromecast!  Edit: All the other Netflix shows (aside from HoC) seem to be there. A number of shows I binged while I was in UK (The Office, Fringe, House MD, Fairy Tail) are not there. There are less movies than I would have expected (mukhang malayo pa sa US), but they seem to have all the Batmans for some reason. I suggest people take the free trial first to see if they like the content offered, though I suppose they will try to add more later.
