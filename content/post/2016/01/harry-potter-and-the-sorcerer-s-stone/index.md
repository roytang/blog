My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1537964638">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I had next to no Harry Potter knowledge before reading this book, save what I read in passing on the internets. Yup, I haven't seen the movies either. Finished reading this in under 3 hours; I had been told ahead of time that it was a light read and that I can confirm. A welcome respite from the last book I read, this book has a straightforward plot, nothing too deep here, it's very much meant for kids/young adults. In fact it reminds me of one of those Hardy Boys books I used to read when I was young, except with a lot more dragons. I wonder what age I can encourage my niece to read this...
