Rowling</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1548999922">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
This is a long book, roughly three times as long as the first Harry Potter book was. That wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so painful to read. Harry here is like a completely different character compared to the previous books, he's irritable and whiny and keeps worrying about how other people aren't treating him well. It's not really teenage angst (since Ron and Hermione seem fine), but rather the character's response to the end of the last book. I hope he's less so in the last two books. Dolores Umbridge made for a great villain here.
