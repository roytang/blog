My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1550941406">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
2016 Book #8: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Someone had already spoiled me ahead of time about the death at the end of this book, although I hadn't known when it would happen. But it started to become obvious as the book went on, so I wasn't too surprised by the end. This book fleshes out the back story of the series' villain Voldemort and finally tries to make Draco Malfoy do something of consequence. The book feels a lot like Empire Strikes Back with the young protagonist learning more about the villain and the bad guys finally dealing a heavy blow. One more book to go!
