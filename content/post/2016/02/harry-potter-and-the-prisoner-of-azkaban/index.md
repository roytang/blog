Rowling</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1537966674">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
The series started off a with rather straightforward stories that made obvious that JK Rowling was new to this business at the time, but Prisoner of Azkaban kicks off the world-building to a larger degree. Many elements of the world are expanded upon and added to and by now we get a better sense of the sort of wonders the world of Harry Potter represents. The plot is starting to get more complex, with more Chekov's gun-type elements firing off as the story spins its plot twists near the book's conclusion. It's easily my favorite book of the series so far
