My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1552013302">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
2016 Book #9: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The book starts off with a lot of action before settling into a phase where the three protagonists wander around a lot and sleep in tents and finally into a big showdown at Hogwarts with virtually every character in the series showing up for one big brawl. It's fun to read, but I'd love to see it in the film too (soon!). I'm a bit ambivalent about how Severus Snape was handled, with the author basically treating him as a bad guy the entire series only to flip him at the last minute. It doesn't help that Alan Rickman died before I finished the series - before Alan Rickman's death I was unaware that Snape was a beloved character and being aware meant I knew he had to do a face turn at some point. The ending was satisfying enough, pretty good for a fantasy series actually; but I would've hoped for more details on what happened to the rest of the cast nineteen years later. We basically only got endings for Harry, Ginny, Ron, Hermione and Draco. Overall the series was pretty good, and covered some ground I wouldn't have expected for a children's/young adult series.
