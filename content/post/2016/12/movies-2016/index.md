#### Deadpool (2016)

<time>[2016-02-11 01:32] </time> Here we go, DEADPOOL spoiler-free review: 

- definitely not for kids; violence, sex, nudity, you name it 
- as you'd expect of a Deadpool movie, lots of jokes, one-liners and fourth wall-breaking. It's a barrel of laughs 
- the plot is mostly straightforward 
- some really nice shots and set pieces 
- lots of references and fan service 
- great supporting cast; hope to see them again in the sequel 
- Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead were great 
- I kind of want to read more Deadpool comics now 
- This movie is better than: Ant-Man (sorry Scott!) 
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: NO 
- Post-credit scene: YES

#### Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)

<time>[2016-03-26 15:03] </time> Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice Spoiler-Free Review: 

- (Edit) OK lang panoorin, wag lang magexpect na super ganda ang story. Entertaining naman mga fight scenes :p 
- not a fan of Affleck's Batman. Too gun-friendly, and he doesn't really show a Bruce Wayne persona. He's dark and brooding and grim in and out of the suit 
- Jeremy Irons as Alfred was ok, but he looks like Tony Stark 
- Eisenberg's Luthor is not the same as any of the previous Luthors. He's a manic genius, closer perhaps to the Riddler 
- a number of plot details don't really make any sense. Need to suspend disbelief quite a bit 
- Snyder is too in love with his slow-motion scenes trying to make everything dramatic 
- there are a number of sequences that don't mesh well together, like Snyder is randomly jumping between scenes that don't cohere  
- in fact, there are particular scenes that feel like "WTH is this scene for, Snyder is just indulging himself now" 
- it's like Superman needs to realise that Lois Lane is more trouble than she's worth 
- yay cameos of future JLers 
- the actual BvS showdown looked great, and went pretty much the way you'd expect 
- Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman was great 
- I liked the final battle sequence 
- many, many things pointing towards the eventual JL movie 
- IMAX? Probably not worth it. Not too much 3d stuff 
- Post-credits scene: NO. Or so the internet tells me, we didn't bother to wait  
- I can see why the reviewers kind of ripped the movie apart. They definitely need to work more on tightening up the movies, but overall this was better than Man of Steel I think.

#### Captain America: Civil War (2016)

<time>[2016-04-27 23:00] </time> - great fight sequences, start to finish
- the newcomers were great, airport big fight sequence had a great surprise (and not the one you already saw in the trailer - although you might have already been spoiled if you pay attention to certain toy lines), although I feel like a couple of the characters were pulled in to the conflict in a way that was a bit weak, but it's still pretty good overall
- the plot was ok. Justification for the civil war was ok. Some surprises. The villain motivation was slightly mediocre, but that wasn't really the focus of the movie anyway
- Martin Freeman's role felt totally superfluous - it did not seem necessary to cast Martin Freeman
- the movie kind of ends with the MCU and the Avengers in a weird place, some people might not like it
- better than: Winter Soldier. The plot kind of develops in the same way but everything is on a much bigger scale now
- there are two post-credit scenes, one in the middle and one at the very end
- Imax worth it? Probably. Not very ostentatious use of 3d, but most of the fight sequences have it. You might get dizzy if you're not used to it
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Maybe, but I'd have to keep explaining who these characters are

[My nitpicks are here](/2016/04/d2l1qqy/).

#### Warcraft (2016)

<time>[2016-05-25 14:30] </time> <time>[May 25, 2016 10:50]</time> Watched Warcraft at SM North Edsa Cinemas 

Warcraft movie review:

- if you are not a fan of Warcraft lore, I do not recommend watching it. It's kind of a generic fantasy movie in that case, nothing too exceptional. Pwede nang cable
- if you are a fan, go watch it. You know you want to
- costumes, cgi, fight scenes fairly good. i was worried that the cgi orcs would look weird and out of place, but I actually like how they turned out
- surprisingly faithful to the original plot of the source material
- ... which leads to a piss-poor ending for anyone just wanting to watch generic fantasy movie, because of what happens to the main characters in the source material
- a lot of warcraft lore elements are introduced with minimal exposition, which would probably overwhelm a non-fan

#### Suicide Squad (2016)

<time>[2016-08-04 18:45] </time> SUICIDE SQUAD Spoiler-Free Review:

- a fun, wild ride. Explosions and gunfire and creepy tentacles abound
- just don't expect too much from the plot or characterization. There was more than one scene where I was like WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
- I liked the soundtrack
- very much a Deadshot/Harley movie, other characters not given much back story
- I still like Ledger's joker over Leto's. Leto's portrayal is like crazy gangster
- I had no idea who the big bad was going in, so that's something. Task Force X completely over their heads
- hard to compare to the other DC movies so far, as it goes in a completely different direction
- one mid-credits scene, no post-credits
- magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. Also, madaming tatanungin

#### Batman Returns (1992)

<time>[2016-08-16 23:08] </time> I just rewatched Batman Returns because I only realized a couple of weeks ago that Christopher Walken was in this movie. The plot is kind of bizarre lol

#### Back to the Future trilogy (1985, 1989, 1990)

<time>[2016-09-03 15:45] </time> Rewatching the Back to the Future trilogy, it still amazes me how much foreshadowing there is in BTTF2

<time>[17:02]</time> It's a science experiment! #BackToTheFuture

#### Doctor Strange (2016)

<time>[2016-10-29 15:56] </time> DOCTOR STRANGE Spoiler-free review:

- Wow. Great visuals and fight-scenes, very trippy. Possibly the best fight scenes in all the MCU movies so far. You might get dizzy with all the things spinning around though
- Plot is typical of a MCU origin story. Hero's journey, some light comedy bits, etc.
- I was expecting them to go a different way with Mordo (if you've read the comics you know what I mean), but I'm happy with how things went down
- Stakes are high, but failure is not final
- The actors were great; I haven't seen a lead this good for a role since RDJ's Tony Stark. Swinton's Ancient One, Eijofor's Mordo, and even Wong's Wong were great
- Doctor friends: Tell me if the medical parts were BS hohoho
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. She doesn't like this kind of thing, and the dizziness thing is bad too
- IMAX or not? I think the 3d parts weren't too exaggerated or critical, but the visuals might feel a bit flat and not as impressive if you don't go IMAX
- Midcredits scene? Yes
- Postcredits scene? Yes

#### Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)

<time>[2016-12-17 23:08] </time> ROGUE ONE Spoiler-free review:

- it's great. As a Star Wars fan, I was very happy with the movie!
- K-2SO best droid ever
- a lot of great shots that really show the scale of things: star destroyers, the death star, etc
- a fun, great movie to watch, with the tension rising almost throughout the entire movie.
- You already know how it ends, but the tension is so well-done that you're worried that history might change!
- IMAX? The big screen was a plus, but the 3d wasn't much. IMAX optional.
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Probably not, madaming itatanong.
- Mid/post credits scene: None.
- R1 > TFA (!)

(I edited in a bunch more details after the original post)

#### Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV (2016)

<time>[2016-12-22 16:29] </time> Just watched the Kingsglaive Blu-Ray. That exceeded my expectations, and I kinda wanna start playing the game now. (I should probably wrap up Xenoblade Chronicles X first)
