Otherwise you will need experienced developers to do the cleanup, which leaves less experienced developers writing new code.  It will end up as an endless cycle of novices making a mess and experts cleaning up after them rather than having a quality at source/start development culture because the tools to do so are available (not relying solely on experience).",
