### Movies

#### Deadpool (2016)

<time>[2016-02-11 01:32] </time> Here we go, DEADPOOL spoiler-free review: 

- definitely not for kids; violence, sex, nudity, you name it 
- as you'd expect of a Deadpool movie, lots of jokes, one-liners and fourth wall-breaking. It's a barrel of laughs 
- the plot is mostly straightforward 
- some really nice shots and set pieces 
- lots of references and fan service 
- great supporting cast; hope to see them again in the sequel 
- Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead were great 
- I kind of want to read more Deadpool comics now 
- This movie is better than: Ant-Man (sorry Scott!) 
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: NO 
- Post-credit scene: YES

#### Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016)

<time>[2016-03-26 15:03] </time> Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice Spoiler-Free Review: 

- (Edit) OK lang panoorin, wag lang magexpect na super ganda ang story. Entertaining naman mga fight scenes :p 
- not a fan of Affleck's Batman. Too gun-friendly, and he doesn't really show a Bruce Wayne persona. He's dark and brooding and grim in and out of the suit 
- Jeremy Irons as Alfred was ok, but he looks like Tony Stark 
- Eisenberg's Luthor is not the same as any of the previous Luthors. He's a manic genius, closer perhaps to the Riddler 
- a number of plot details don't really make any sense. Need to suspend disbelief quite a bit 
- Snyder is too in love with his slow-motion scenes trying to make everything dramatic 
- there are a number of sequences that don't mesh well together, like Snyder is randomly jumping between scenes that don't cohere  
- in fact, there are particular scenes that feel like "WTH is this scene for, Snyder is just indulging himself now" 
- it's like Superman needs to realise that Lois Lane is more trouble than she's worth 
- yay cameos of future JLers 
- the actual BvS showdown looked great, and went pretty much the way you'd expect 
- Gal Gadot as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman was great 
- I liked the final battle sequence 
- many, many things pointing towards the eventual JL movie 
- IMAX? Probably not worth it. Not too much 3d stuff 
- Post-credits scene: NO. Or so the internet tells me, we didn't bother to wait  
- I can see why the reviewers kind of ripped the movie apart. They definitely need to work more on tightening up the movies, but overall this was better than Man of Steel I think.

#### Warcraft (2016)

<time>[2016-05-25 14:30] </time> <time>[May 25, 2016 10:50]</time> Watched Warcraft at SM North Edsa Cinemas 

Warcraft movie review:

- if you are not a fan of Warcraft lore, I do not recommend watching it. It's kind of a generic fantasy movie in that case, nothing too exceptional. Pwede nang cable
- if you are a fan, go watch it. You know you want to
- costumes, cgi, fight scenes fairly good. i was worried that the cgi orcs would look weird and out of place, but I actually like how they turned out
- surprisingly faithful to the original plot of the source material
- ... which leads to a piss-poor ending for anyone just wanting to watch generic fantasy movie, because of what happens to the main characters in the source material
- a lot of warcraft lore elements are introduced with minimal exposition, which would probably overwhelm a non-fan

#### Suicide Squad (2016)

<time>[2016-08-04 18:45] </time> SUICIDE SQUAD Spoiler-Free Review:

- a fun, wild ride. Explosions and gunfire and creepy tentacles abound
- just don't expect too much from the plot or characterization. There was more than one scene where I was like WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
- I liked the soundtrack
- very much a Deadshot/Harley movie, other characters not given much back story
- I still like Ledger's joker over Leto's. Leto's portrayal is like crazy gangster
- I had no idea who the big bad was going in, so that's something. Task Force X completely over their heads
- hard to compare to the other DC movies so far, as it goes in a completely different direction
- one mid-credits scene, no post-credits
- magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. Also, madaming tatanungin

#### Batman Returns (1992)

<time>[2016-08-16 23:08] </time> I just rewatched Batman Returns because I only realized a couple of weeks ago that Christopher Walken was in this movie. The plot is kind of bizarre lol

#### Back to the Future trilogy (1985, 1989, 1990)

<time>[2016-09-03 15:45] </time> Rewatching the Back to the Future trilogy, it still amazes me how much foreshadowing there is in BTTF2

<time>[17:02]</time> It's a science experiment! #BackToTheFuture

#### Doctor Strange (2016)

<time>[2016-10-29 15:56] </time> DOCTOR STRANGE Spoiler-free review:

- Wow. Great visuals and fight-scenes, very trippy. Possibly the best fight scenes in all the MCU movies so far. You might get dizzy with all the things spinning around though
- Plot is typical of a MCU origin story. Hero's journey, some light comedy bits, etc.
- I was expecting them to go a different way with Mordo (if you've read the comics you know what I mean), but I'm happy with how things went down
- Stakes are high, but failure is not final
- The actors were great; I haven't seen a lead this good for a role since RDJ's Tony Stark. Swinton's Ancient One, Eijofor's Mordo, and even Wong's Wong were great
- Doctor friends: Tell me if the medical parts were BS hohoho
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. She doesn't like this kind of thing, and the dizziness thing is bad too
- IMAX or not? I think the 3d parts weren't too exaggerated or critical, but the visuals might feel a bit flat and not as impressive if you don't go IMAX
- Midcredits scene? Yes
- Postcredits scene? Yes

#### Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016)

<time>[2016-12-17 23:08] </time> ROGUE ONE Spoiler-free review:

- it's great. As a Star Wars fan, I was very happy with the movie!
- K-2SO best droid ever
- a lot of great shots that really show the scale of things: star destroyers, the death star, etc
- a fun, great movie to watch, with the tension rising almost throughout the entire movie.
- You already know how it ends, but the tension is so well-done that you're worried that history might change!
- IMAX? The big screen was a plus, but the 3d wasn't much. IMAX optional.
- Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Probably not, madaming itatanong.
- Mid/post credits scene: None.
- R1 > TFA (!)

(I edited in a bunch more details after the original post)

#### Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV (2016)

<time>[2016-12-22 16:29] </time> Just watched the Kingsglaive Blu-Ray. That exceeded my expectations, and I kinda wanna start playing the game now. (I should probably wrap up Xenoblade Chronicles X first)

### TV

#### Battlestar Galactica (2004)

<time>[2016-02-22 16:11] </time> Finished watching the Battlestar Galactica 2004 series. Really great space opera throughout the series but that ending was weaksauce

#### Daredevil Season 2

<time>[2016-03-21 02:24] </time> Daredevil Season 2 spoiler-free review: 

- Punisher and Karen were great 
- Matt and Elektra, kind of weird, but I guess it's okay 
- great fight scenes and cinematography as usual 
- the plot is less tightly focused than compared to S1, there's a lot of things going on at the same time.  
- it starts a bit slow, but picks up later on, then slow down a bit again and picks up again 
- they pick up some leftover threads from S1, all the surviving major players make an appearance 
- the Daredevil costume feels so weird, and it feels like it sometimes changes in shading/composition across episodes (it makes it harder to draw lol) 
- there's some romantic tension being formed but it feels a bit off or maybe even forced 
- I want to complain about some (minor) things, but it's hard to do that without you know, spoilers lol 
- ending felt weaker than S1

#### Merlin (BBC)

<time>[2016-05-15 00:21] </time> Finished watching all 5 seasons of the BBC Merlin show. Lots of Game of Thrones actors making an appearance lol. I like how they flipped the trope of Merlin being a wise old wizard advising Arthur, but of course the series ending was way too predictable (it can't be helped given the Arthurian legend)

#### Legends of Tomorrow season 1

<time>[2016-05-21 06:08] </time> Finished Legends of Tomorrow S1. It wasn't always the best, and their time travel logic is terribly inconsistent, but I think it was a fun ride overall and finished strong with a great cliffhanger for S2. Mike Ross ftw!

#### Gotham season 2

<time>[2016-06-02 23:45] </time> Okay, the ending was a bit weak for me but now that I've caught up, Gotham had a great season 2! Ranking now changed: Gotham > Shield/Flash > LoT > Arrow haha  The show has greatly improved since they moved away from the villain-of-the-week format and went for longer story arcs, and lots more comic book references too! The only story arc I wasn't too happy about was the Penguin family stuff, but it didn't matter too much so that's fine. Looking forward to Season 3!

#### Game of Thrones S6

<time>[2016-06-27 11:26] </time> Game of Thrones season finale very satisfying, cleanly sets up for season 7 with no annoying cliffhangers. Well done!

#### Star Trek: Voyager

<time>[2016-08-02 06:09] </time> Just watched the series finale of Star Trek Voyager, finally those crazy nerds managed to get home! I came into the series with low expectations given its reputation, but I think it was pretty ok overall. There were some pretty ridiculous episodes here and there, but even the much-revered TNG suffered from that. Janeway made some questionable decisions throughout the series, but arguably they were faced with a different set of quandaries than the crew of TNG or DS9. I feel like Voyager also had way more time travel episodes than either TNG or DS9 for some reason.

Best character: The Doctor, although he's kind of a deus-ex-machina too, especially once he gets that mobile emitter "Oh, don't worry I can do that super dangerous thing because I'm a hologram!". Seven of Nine a close second, I was mildly annoyed with the character as first introduced, but she was developed well as the series went along.

Worst character: Chakotay. Ugh, I cringe whenever there's one of his "Space Indian" episodes. He didn't even do anything in the series finale except be a love interest for Seven of Nine

#### Luke Cage season 1

<time>[2016-10-01 22:16] </time> Luke Cage spoiler-free review:

- this is an unapologetically very black show. It highlights black culture, black music, black history, and so on
- gang violence, sleazy politicians, corrupt cops
- most of the cast give great performances
- rosario dawson's role seems to get bigger with each additional series
- lots of great easter eggs for comic book fans
- might have been an episode or two too long
- I did not like the ending too much, though I can see why they might have gone that way

#### Black Mirror seasons 1-3

<time>[2016-12-22 21:34] </time> Finished Black Mirror this week. It is indeed a heavy show, but I find that it becomes a lot easier to watch (and binge) if you try not to get attached to the characters and just accept that horrible things will happen to them lol
