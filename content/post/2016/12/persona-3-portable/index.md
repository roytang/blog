I also finished Persona 3 Portable today (purchased in 2013 and have been playing it on and off since Feb 2015). I figured I should clear it off my backlog before P5 next year. Didnt manage a completionist run though

I finished the game on PS Vita, but it was actually a PSP title! This version had the female protag available, but I only did one run with the male protag. My save data says I had 56 hours play time.
