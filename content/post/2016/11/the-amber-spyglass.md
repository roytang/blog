My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1822050997">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Pros:<br />- I liked having the bear back<br />- Diamond-legged creatures with wheels!<br />- An honest effort to tie up all the loose ends and give each character decent endings<br />- A decent read, at least<br /><br />Cons:<br />- allegories aren't very subtle<br />- people get miraculously redeemed, even Mrs Coulter who was such a great villain<br />- build up of Asriel's awesome plan to take the War to Heaven only to find out he didn't really know what he was doing until he found out he had to somehow help two kids find their pets<br />- build up of how powerful Metatron was, but then at the end <br />
