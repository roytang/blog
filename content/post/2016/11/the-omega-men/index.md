My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1818612533">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Violent, mysterious, and the story unveils in a great way. Art was terrific too, even if there were some issues with guest artists. Some of the best comic-book space sci-fi I've read since the Annihilation War
