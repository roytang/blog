<time>[Fri, Nov. 18, 2016, 11:27 a.m.]</time> What a waste of a mandate and potential political capital, to spend it on this ridiculous sideshow that is the Marcos burial. I'm at least able to understand a little bit the twisted logic behind the violent war on drugs since it is supposedly being done "for the good of the country", but this madness is obviously done all for the sake of an actual temperemental brat wanting to pay back political debts and to whitewash the record of a tyrant. The president of the country traded the dignity of this country for political support, that's how much he thinks of us.

<time>[Sat, Nov. 19, 2016, 7:22 a.m.]</time> I've seen a number of people posting/sharing something promoting the idea that instead of blaming the Marcos or Duterte, we should be blaming the people who were in power for 30 years for not passing a law to prevent the dictator from being buried in an place of honor. This is a ridiculous, after-the-fact justification to attempt to shift blame and wash hands of a betrayal done to the people.

Think about it, of those 3 parties:
a) one party has been negligent
b) one party has purposely and systematically abused power over this country for more than a decade
c) one party has purposely traded this country's dignity for the sake of political patronage

All of these are things we should condemn, but the last two are betrayals while the other one is at worst stupidity. If you think (a) is worse than (b) or (c) and that we should just move on or something, you are contributing to the problem of our short-term political memory being akin to a goldfish.

#MarcosNotAHero

"Moving on" shouldnt mean setting aside these betrayals and letting their memory fade, otherwise we are condemned to history repeating itself. Instead we should #NeverForget and remain vigilant against abuses by current and future governments.

*A friend asked "Would there be as much attention, flak, protests, etc. to/against the Marcos Burial if the Republic Memorial Cemetery was never renamed to Libingan ng mga Bayani?" and I guess you can say I'm kind of preachy, so my reply turned out a bit too long. I thought I'd share it here para mas sulit yung effort sa pagsulat lol*

We as a people, we have short memories and we forgive easily, putting us in danger of forgetting the atrocities of that era and hence risking that we are condemned to repeat it. The Marcos family knows this and have taken the time and effort to try to turn back the judgment of history. You need only look at all the propaganda during the last election as evidence.

Many people see these videos and memes praising the Marcos presidency and the martial law era and we see a danger, a danger that is already coming true now. Many of our fellow citizens are already swallowing the Marcos propaganda that somehow the Martial Law era was good for us, that somehow a president who has been tagged as the second-worst plunderer in the world was a hero that needs worshipping. This burial is yet another step, an important step, in the Marcos family attempting to redeem their legacy and revise our national memory.

Yes, it's just a name. If it were just people like you and me who could easily dismiss the burial by saying "that's just a name, madami namang andyan na hindi bayani", it wouldn't be a big deal. But like all tyrants know, names are symbols and names and symbols have power. People believe in name and symbols, no matter what our rational minds think.

Why do you think they are fighting so hard for this? Marcos has been dead for ages, why not just bury him in Ilocos Norte where they know he will be loved and his grave left unvandalized and not risk all this outcry? Why is the president so insistent on this, when even among his own followers there are many who are against the move? It's true that we have so many other things to worry about as a country, so why insist on this, when they know it's a deeply divisive move? They know the stakes. They know they don't have to insist on declaring him a hero openly, the mere symbolism of him being buried there is enough, for now.

Quoting Jon Limjap: 

<blockquote>
"Whether or not you liked his son, whether or not you believed in propaganda against him, and whether or not you want to spite him by removing his name from the airport, this person died believing he was doing something good for his country. The other one? They knew people will be against it, so they had to sneak his body in to his "burial place of honor". Pwe."

August 31, 1983.

No one organized this but millions came and created the world's biggest funeral procession. No soldiers secured this. This was not kept a secret. No 21 gun salute. The body was not flown by helicopter. The family did not demand a hero's burial.
