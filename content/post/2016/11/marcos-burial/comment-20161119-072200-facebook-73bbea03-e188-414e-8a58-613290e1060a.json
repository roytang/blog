  "text": "I've seen a number of people posting/sharing something promoting the idea that instead of blaming the Marcos or Duterte, we should be blaming the people who were in power for 30 years for not passing a law to prevent the dictator from being buried in an place of honor. This is a ridiculous, after-the-fact justification to attempt to shift blame and wash hands of a betrayal done to the people.\n\nThink about it, of those 3 parties:\na) one party has been negligent\nb) one party has purposely and systematically abused power over this country for more than a decade\nc) one party has purposely traded this country's dignity for the sake of political patronage\n\nAll of these are things we should condemn, but the last two are betrayals while the other one is at worst stupidity. If you think (a) is worse than (b) or (c) and that we should just move on or something, you are contributing to the problem of our short-term political memory being akin to a goldfish.\n\n#MarcosNotAHero\n\n\"Moving on\" shouldnt mean setting aside these betrayals and letting their memory fade, otherwise we are condemned to history repeating itself. Instead we should #NeverForget and remain vigilant against abuses by current and future governments.",
