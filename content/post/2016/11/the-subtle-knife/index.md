My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1820847091">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Well, the knife may be subtle, but the allegories are not. I can see why some religious folk might find the trilogy's themes controversial, but as far as I can see they're still just fantasy stories. We'll see how things ramp up in the last book.<br /><br />I kind of miss that bear though.
