Previously: [Civilization IV](/2005/12/games-civilization-4/)

### Intro

This is a backpost, written in 2024, but back-dated to Oct 20, 2016. Civ6 releases the next day Oct 21, 2016, so I probably won't be playing Civ5 too much after today.

Civ5 first released way back in 2010, so I played it for 10 years! It is the first entry in the series to be exclusive to Steam on PC, and one of my favorite things, the first one to have achievements! It was also I believe the very first game I preordered on Steam, and my second Steam purchase overall (after [Duels of the Planeswalkers](/2010/06/dotp/)).

### Completion

The number of achievements in the game is truly ridiculous though. At the end of it's life cycle, the game had a whopping 286 achievements, of which I had only achieved 176 over almost 400 hours of play time. To this day it remains among my top 5 most played Steam games!

{{% photos 1_788988726265262080_CvMM-qpUsAAMe6h %}}

The sheer number of achievements missed makes me feel like I didn't truly experience the breadth the game had to over and maybe missed out. Which is easily true - I didn't really play any of the scenarios that come with the game, that's not really a game mode that never engaged me. Many of the missing achievements are for those scenarios. There are also a number of achievements that require ultra-specific setups that either try to make some puns work or allude to historical events.

### Graphics

The game gets a nice graphical overhaul over the predecessor, with what seems like a more "colorful" feel and UI (I have no concrete basis for this as it has been even longer since I played Civ IV!)

### Gameplay Changes

Vanilla Civ5 felt to me like a big leap in gameplay over Civ4. The major changes are:

- Hex grid: Makes for more interesting map layouts and distances arent nonsensical, but this feels more like a cosmetic change for me, the really big change is...
- One unit per tile (more or less): Gone are Civ4's doomstacks. With the one-unit-per-tile limit, combat becomes much more tactical (and also challenging for the AI). Also, units now have HP and combats are not necessarily instant death. You typically spend a lot of time fighting, so this feels like the biggest change to the game.
- City States: Minor powers represented by a single city that you can either ally with or bully or conquer or whatever. Adds a whole new dimension to the game moving forward. And it allowed PH representation with Manila appearing as a city-state!

Lots of other more minor changes and system overhauls of course, but those are the highlights for me.

The **Gods and Kings** expansion released in 2012 added espionage and religion, which felt like missing features that should have been in the base game maybe?

The **Brave New World** expansion released in 2013 added international trade routes, world congress (improving diplomacy overall), tourism, and great works.

Civ5 ended up with I think 43 leader/civ combinations that you can play, each with their own gameplay advantages. I'm a big fan of large lineups of course, and the game even features random select! (All good games have large lineups and random select!)

### Multiplayer

I had some friends who I did manage to multiplayer Civ5 with, though I think we always had trouble with the netcode. 

### Mods

I don't like using mods, but a friend swears by the Vox Populi overhaul mod and he says it makes Civ5 vastly better.

### Overall

Overall very happy with the game of course (hard to say otherwise with the number of hours invested!), and now that I'm looking back at it I'm kind of tempted to reinstall it and go for some of these achievements again!
