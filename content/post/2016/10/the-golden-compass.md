My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1778115581">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Well, the book started off a bit slow, with the protag meandering about while the author did his worldbuilding and all, but the pace picked up quickly after the first third or so of the book; I finished the rest of it one sitting<br /><br />I don't see anything too Church-controversial yet, though I'm told it becomes more obvious by the third book. I like how most of it was told through a child's eyes. I'm not sure that was the best way to end a first book though<br /><br />I kind of want to see the movie, even though I heard it tanked, mostly just to watch the awesome bear duel to the death
