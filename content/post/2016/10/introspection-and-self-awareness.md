Sometimes I write something and at the end I find that it upsets me. Or I think about something I haven't thought about in a long time just before I sleep, then I have a nightmare about it and it saddens me to think that my subconscious still hasn't let go of it after all this time

That's a good thing though, right? One of the purpose of writing and introspection is to become more attuned to your inner thoughts and emotions, to better understand and work with your own self. I try to have this self-awareness that I'm sure not many people bother with

Just yesterday, a friend asked me why I tracked a certain thing that I do. I told him that I track a lot of things because memory is poor and fragile. I track the restaurants I go to, the shows I watch, the books I read, the games I play, the things I spend money on, how much I sleep, etc. Maybe I should add "how I feel" to that list too

Introspection and self-awareness is a fine line to walk. You don't want to be so absorbed in yourself that you get bogged down in overthinking. Yet everyone needs some level of self-awareness in their life -- if only to be able to identify when their own prejudices, fears, or other emotions are starting to affect daily decisions
