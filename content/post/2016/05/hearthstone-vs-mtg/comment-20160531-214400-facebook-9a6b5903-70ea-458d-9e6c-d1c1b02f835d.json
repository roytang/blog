  "text": "Hearthstone does make more profit for Blizz than MtG makes for WotC. There's a lot of money in MtG but more of it lies in the secondary market, which doesn't benefit Wizards at all. Plus Hearthstone has no printing cost, is more casual-friendly, and has the WoW marketing behind it as an incidental secondary push.",
