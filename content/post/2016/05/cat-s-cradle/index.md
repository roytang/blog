My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1633381770">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
Cat's Cradle is only the second Vonnegut book I've read, after Slaughterhouse Five. I find myself fascinated with how he unveils his narrative in short, seemingly disconnected bursts, something much more obvious in this book. Like S5, CC's plot starts close to normal ordinary fiction and ends in a completely different place that's strictly in the realm of sci-fi. A great read, and very easy too given the structure of ridiculously short chapters
