My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1644365650">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I've been following and reading Scott Berkun's blog on and off for the past 5 years or so, so I already have a passing familiarity with this work. Mindfire collects some of the best essays from his blog into an easy-to-read format that you can digest in one-to-two sittings. Berkun writes about a number of diverse topics such as how to think critically and how to interact with other people and how to spend your attention. Maybe "Big Ideas" is a bit grandiose, as many of these essays tackle things that seem more like they should be common sense but aren't. But as Berkun himself states in one of the essays, the size of the idea isn't indicative of its quality - smaller ideas can generate a lot of value too. Pretty good read.
