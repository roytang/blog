  * still too much focus on Jennifer Lawrence/Mystique
  * some great soundtrack choices
  * Quicksilver scene maybe just a tiny bit too long. Tradition of defying the rules of physics continues (I hope someone does the math on how fast he was probably moving)
  * nice 80s wardrobe lol
  * not particularly faithful to the source material
  * plot is all over the place, a lot of WTF moments here and there. OMG that stupid arrow D:
  * lots of faults, but you'll probably enjoy it anyway if you're an X-men fan just for all the random easter eggs you spot ("Hey, it's random third-string comic book character in a completely different role!")
  * post-credits scene? YES
  * I'm kind of hoping they go for Dark Phoenix Saga next (Aliens!) but the PCS tells us they have more sinister designs in mind... 
  * WillÂ Mama like it? Probably not.
  * I'd rate it worse than DoFP, probably around the same or slightly worse than First Class
