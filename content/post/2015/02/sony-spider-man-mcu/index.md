Yay, Spider-Man in the MCU, etc. But I'm not sure I want to see Uncle Ben die again. Has it definitely been announced that Andrew Garfield is out? He did fine in the role, but was trapped in the quagmire that was the ridiculous plot of ASM2.

Given how well DC has handled The Flash, I'd probably prefer if Spider-Man was given the similar small-screen treatment instead. A lot of the great Spider-Man stories work well due to long-established relationships that are harder to get right in a movie and would be better off built up over one or more TV seasons. With Movie Spider-Man, we'd never have a chance to see stories exploring his relationship with established characters like Jeanne deWolff, Flash Thompson, Harry Osborne, Daredevil, Jameson, Silver Sable, Kingpin, etc. or more complicated villain arcs that can only happen with recurring villains like Kraven's Last Hunt or Superior Spider-man. There's not even a chance that he'll play a central part in Captain America: Civil War as a lot of people want, since that requires Spidey's Avengers history to be well-established and for him to already have a good relationship with Tony

I'm not even sure what they'd do for more Spider-Man movies that hasn't already been covered by the first five movies. The major villains have already appeared, so I'd imagine there'd be repeats. Many of the major comic book arcs rely on some comic book silliness that I don't think would translate well to movies: Clone Saga? Morlun/The Other? And of course we can rule out pretty much everything that happens after One More Day

...it's possible that I may have already read too much Spider-Man for one lifetime
