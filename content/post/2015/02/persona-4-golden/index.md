title: Persona 4 Golden
---

This is the first Persona game I played. I started playing it in Jun 2013. 

A quick "impressions" post [I made on Reddit at the time](https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1fxgqg/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/caf62ru/):

> I started up Persona 4: Golden on the Vita. It's mildly addictive, because I keep wanting to maximize what I do everyday. If you haven't played it, it's a weird cross of dungeon crawling with Pokemon-like battles (elemental weaknesses, etc) and Life/Dating Sim (for the noncombat parts); the relationships you build in the noncombat parts improve the Personas (pokemon) you can use in the dungeons, the noncombat stats unlock quests that require you to farm in the dungeons, etc. I think I've played some 20-30 hours since starting it around Tuesday or Wednesday.

Looks like I first finished the first run before the end of June 2013 at level 79 with 69hrs playtime.

In Jun 2014 I started a second run on Very Easy for completion. In Feb 2016 I found that I messed up the 2nd run such that I would need another run for completion (I believe it was no longer possible to challenge Margaret and the Reaper). 

Total playtime for both runs is at around 114 hours. I did not bother doing another run for completion!
