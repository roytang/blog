#### Zombeavers (2014)

<time>[2015-02-09 20:35] </time> This bus is showing a b movie about some college students vacationing in a cabin in the woods and being attacked by some sort of demonic beavers. Identify the movie

#### Kingsman: The Secret Service (2015)

<time>[2015-02-20 21:32] </time> Couldnt get a ride so I decided to watch Kingsman. Fun movie although I must note it's very violent. I haven't read the source material, but that's pretty much what I'd expect of Mark Millar

#### Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)

<time>[2015-05-19 00:18] </time> Mad Max was kind of crazy. I hadn't seen any of the originals, so wasn't sure what to expect. Pretty exciting stuff

#### Jurassic World (2015)

<time>[2015-06-14 16:43] </time> <time>[Jun 14, 2015 13:32]</time> Watched Jurassic World at Sm North Edsa - The Block Cinema 4. Anliit ng screen :(

Jurassic World was great! Felt like watching Jurassic Park again. I wish Jeff Goldblum made an appearance though lol

#### Ant-Man (2015)

<time>[2015-07-16 00:40] </time> <time>[Jul 15, 2015 21:28]</time> Watched Ant-Man at Trinoma Cinema 7

Ant Man spoiler-free review: The first half felt a bit off, with some exposition coming off as forced and the pacing a bit awkward. Things picked up later on and while the plot was not entirely unpredictable there were a number of fun and surprising tangents. Overall a fun and entertaining movie with enough stuff for comic book Marvel fans to enjoy, probably close in quality to the first Iron Man movie, if not better

#### Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2004)

<time>[2015-08-08 03:53] </time> I randomly stumbled upon some free open air cinema thing so now I guess I'm gonna watch Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind

#### The Martian (2015)

<time>[2015-10-14 06:19] </time> Things software development projects can learn from "The Martian" (maybe spoilers lol): 

- If you rush things, you might leave something behind that will cost you a lot more later 
- You need to have buffer in your schedule for the inevitable disasters 
- If you have impossible deadlines, limited resources, overworked staff, and decide to skip testing to meet deadlines, don't expect things to go smoothly 
- If your stuff doesn't work, see if there's some Chinese alternative. Or look for some sort of coffee-powered genius to come up with a miracle solution 
- If you make a unpopular decision, your staff might go off on their own and risk their lives trying to complete the mission 
- Problems will occur at almost every step, be prepared to make stuff up as you go along 
- Solve one problem at a time until you get to go home

#### Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens (2015)

{{< photos force >}}

<time>[2015-12-18 00:50] </time> As is tradition, my spoiler-free review of The Force Awakens: 

- rewatching the original trilogy immediately before this one was well worth it 
- wow a lot of beautiful shots and landscapes, from beginning to end 
- the heart of the true Star Wars fan will skip a beat every time the background music comes up 
- it feels like coming home. A lot of familiar elements, interspersed with the new. A nice way to transition into a new trilogy 
- I often wonder what it must have felt like to watch the original Star Wars: A New Hope in the theaters back then. This is how I imagined it to be 
- Try not to think about the fact that Episode VIII won't come until 2017 :D 
- quite possibly the best movie of 2015 
- on the ride home I was like: Ten ten tenetenenten tenetenenten tentenenten ... (okay, maybe I was like that before the movie too)
- 
- ...  
- 
- ...yeah, it was ok :D

#### Fargo

<time>[2015-12-30 08:00] </time> On this date, I watched Fargo (1996), mostly so I could also watch the Fargo TV series which was already 2 seasons in.

My commentary (from chat logs):

- 21:47	Roy Tang:	its not a particularly funny movie though
- 21:48	Lizbeth:	nakakatawa kaya yung misadventures at kapalpakan :))
- 21:50	Roy Tang:	natatawa ako na brainerd yung pangalan ng tow
- 21:58	Lizbeth:	lol
- 22:12	Roy Tang:	parang lahat na lang nag go wrong
- 22:12	Roy Tang:	it was a stupid plan anyway
