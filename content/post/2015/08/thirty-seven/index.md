I like to be optimistic, or at least to try to. And to believe the best of people, or at least try to. It's not always easy. Sometimes people disappoint you. Sometimes you feel lost. Or stressed. Or stuck in a rut. And you don't know what to do.

You have to be able to look within yourself to find your own drive, to find the ability to move forward in spite of the tough times. And to be able to appreciate the good things in your life.

Despite some bad spots, I've still had a pretty good twelve months though. I've traveled a lot, and plan to travel more before the year ends. I'm still learning new things. I'm still blessed with good family and friends and a means to sustain myself and my wants.

My birthday always feels like a good opportunity to step back and take a breather and find some perspective. And to re-affirm the choice to keep moving forward -- one step at a time...
