Due to an inordinate amount of time spent in a waiting room, i managed to finish Sanderson's Way of Kings today. Great book that I really enjoyed despite taking three months to finish it. The author shows off some great world building and gives us great protagonists to follow. Hopefully I can find a hardcopy of the second book somewhere
