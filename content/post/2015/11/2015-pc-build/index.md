#### Posted on r/Philippines: [What's the best shop in SM North cyberzone for putting together a new desktop?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/3qs409/whats_the_best_shop_in_sm_north_cyberzone_for/)

Yun tipong I bring them a list of parts I want (and probably my old graphics card and hard drive) tapos sila na magassemble for me

Edit: I've assembled multiple desktops myself, I don't want to do it anymore. SM North Cyberzone para I can do a price check while I'm there running errands.

#### Posted on r/buildapc: [Hello, planning to build a PC soon. Have put together a list of parts available from my local shop](https://reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3r2lhj/hello_planning_to_build_a_pc_soon_have_put/)

Case	Thermaltake Versa H25

PSU	Corsair V650W

CPU	Intel Core i5-4460

MB	ASUS H81M-D

RAM	2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600

VC	Inno3d GTX970 4gb

SSD	Kingston V300 240gb

HDD	Toshiba/Seagate 2tb SATA

Does this seem fine? I'm not sure if I have to consider anything about the power supply, or if any of these components have a bad reputation or something. Thanks!

#### Posted on r/buildapc: [Is a GTX970 worth it if I dont plan to play at ridiculously high resolutions or anything like 4k gaming?](https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/3rq30u/is_a_gtx970_worth_it_if_i_dont_plan_to_play_at/)

Trying to decide between splurging on a GTX970 or just settling for a GTX750Ti for now and possibly upgrading in the future. I'm not one of those guys who plans to play at really high resolutions or need to have ultra settings all the time, so I'm not sure if the high end one will be worth it. Thoughts?

The rest of my build, if that matters:

| |  | 
| --- | --- | 
| Case | Thermaltake Versa H25 | 
| PSU | Seasonic S12II Bronze 620W | 
| CPU | Intel Core i5-4460 | 
| MB | ASUS H97MPLUS | 
| RAM | 2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600 | 
| VC | Palit GTX970 Jetstream OC 4gb ddr5 | 
| SSD | Samsung 850Evo 250gb | 
| HDD | Seagate 2tb |

<time>[Sat, Nov. 7, 2015, 9:21 a.m.]</time> Thanks to everyone who helped provide advice for my PC build. The final specs, if anyone is curious:  

- Case Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B 
- Fan 120mm internal aux fan 
- PSU Cooler Master B600 V2 600W 
- CPU Intel Core i5-4460 MB 
- ASUS H97ME RAM 2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600 
- VC Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb 
- SSD Samsung 850Evo 250gb 
- HDD Seagate 2tb  
 
Turned out quite expensive (#splurge), but hopefully I don't need to upgrade again for a long while, if at all
