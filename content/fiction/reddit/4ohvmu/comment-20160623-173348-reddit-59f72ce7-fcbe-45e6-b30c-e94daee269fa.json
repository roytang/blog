  "text": "I really enjoyed this story. There were a few times where I felt like there was, maybe, a little too much dialogue.\n\nI don't think if I'd spent my whole life seeking revenge, that I'd let the guy get out so many words. Given that she does, it makes it hard to believe that she's turned into a monster.\n\nBut it's easy to make it work, because I just choose to believe she wept because she's *not* a monster, and she's going to change.\n\nAnyway, it was a great story and that was the only thing I could think of for constructive feedback. :)\n\nGood luck on the contest!",
