I needed to transfer a file to my phone today, but could not find my USB cable. I figured I&'d try out the Bluetooth with the laptop.

After around 30 minutes of struggling with the unintuitiveness and some helpful googling I finally was able to transfer my file using the ff steps, for future reference:

1. Turn on Bluetooth on the Acer Aspire using the Bluetooth button.

2. Right-click the Bluetooth icon on the systray -> Show Bluetooth Devices -> Options -> tick &#8220;Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer&#8221;

3. Enable Bluetooth on the N73 via menu -> Tools -> Bluetooth

4. Scroll right on the N73 and the Paired Device screen is shown. Choose Options -> New Paired Device

5. The N73 should list your computer name (mine is PANDA!), select the computer name and you&'ll be prompted for a passkey. Don&'t input anything yet&#8230;

6. Back to the Vista PC, right-click the Bluetooth icon in the systray, then choose Add Device.

7. Tick &#8220;My device is set up and ready to be found.&#8221; and click Next.

8. The wizard should list your phone. Choose the phone and click Next.

9. Tick &#8220;Let me choose my own passkey&#8221;, and type a passkey.

10. You get the message to &#8220;Please enter the passkey on your Bluetooth device now&#8221;, so do just that.

11. The bluetooth connection should be all set up, to send a file to your N73, right-click the bluetooth icon and click Send a file

12. You&'re done. Hooray!

Side note: After step 10, Vista seems to want to install drivers for the N73&#8230;but it doesn&'t seem to be necessary
