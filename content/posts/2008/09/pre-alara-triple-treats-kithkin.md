Catching up on my tournament reports now:

Sep 7, Pre-Alara Triple Treat (Prerelease passes at stake)

I&#8217;m playing the same deck as I did in the GP Manila Day Two PTQs.

Round 1 vs 5-color merfolk: 2-0 win.

Round 2 vs Kithkin (mirror match) 0-2 loss. I generally don&#8217;t know how to play the mirror match.

Round 3 vs 5-color control: 1-2 loss. His build was too strong against Kithkin; in addition to Firespouts and Hallowed Burials, he also had Soul Snuffers.

Drop. Tournament record: 1-2-drop. This turned out to be a mistake, as I found out the following week that X-2 might have had a chance of winning prerelease passes.

Sep 14 Pre-Alara Triple Treat (Prerelease passes at stake)

I changed the sideboard, taking out the janky Pollen Lullabies and putting in 3 Knight of Meadowgrain to improve my creature battles in the mirror. I also went with +3 Kinsbaile Borderguard, -2 Order of Whiteclay, -1 Crib Swap to better fight mass removal.

Round 1 vs Kithkin (mirror match): 2-1 win. I basically just overloaded with Spectrals and Cloudgoats to take game 3.

Round 2 vs Faeries: 2-0 win. My opponent had what he called &#8220;the three-land curse&#8221; in game two and hardly put up a fight.

Round 3 vs Unknown deck (no notes): 2-0 win. I&#8217;ll update this if I figure it out.

Round 4 vs Switch with 5-color control (Quick and Toast): 2-1 win. Switch and I seem to play each other often if we&#8217;re in the same tournament. He won our practice games earlier, but this time I was serious :p

Round 5 vs Monogreen splashing red (Firespout) and black (Thoughtseize, Profane Command): 2-0 win.

Round 6 vs Faeries: 0-2 loss. I kept subpar hands both games. My opponent told me I should be boarding out the Cloudgoat Rangers. Is this true?

Round 7 vs Monoblack: 2-0 win. My opponent is a regular player and we often meet at tournaments, and I&#8217;ve borrowed cards from him in the past. One time we happened to be riding the same jeepney together, and he treated me to the jeepney fare, but jokingly said I should give him the win next time we meet in a tournament and I begged off of course. Lolz, lucky.

Tournament result: 5-2, enough for sixth place and a prerelease pass! Free Ajani Vengeant!

This is the end for Lorwyn block constructed!
