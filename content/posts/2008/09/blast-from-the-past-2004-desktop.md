I was going through some old files today, I found this screenshot of my desktop from 2004:

[
  
<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-545" title="desktop" src="/files/uploads/2008/09/desktop-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" />

Actually, I still like that wallpaper. It&#8217;s well-drawn. It&#8217;s from
  
[
  
RPGamer Theme Central.

Items I had in the quick-launch toolbar:

  * mIRC (for downloading comics)
  * Thunderbird
  * IE
  * IE again (?!)
  * I believe this is EditPad, a notepad replacement
  * Chami.com HTML-Kit
  * WinAmp
  * Windows Media Player
  * DivX Player
  * No idea
  * Shortcut to some folder
  * Kazaa (pirate!)
  * No idea
  * 2xExplorer (Windows explorer alternative)
  * Crimson Editor (so far there are at least 3 different text editors)
  * Show Desktop
  * Terminal
  * Outlook (I never used this)
  * Excel
  * No idea
  * Thunderbird again&#8230;apparently I never cleaned up this taskbar.
  * Visualboy Advance
  * Firefox
  * Quicktime (3 different media players too!)
  * Warcraft III
  * Yahoo Messenger
  * No idea

For reference, here&#8217;s today&#8217;s desktop, same wallpaper:
