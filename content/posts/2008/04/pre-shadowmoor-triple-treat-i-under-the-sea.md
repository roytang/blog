Tournament was last April 6 2008 at NG Galleria, with 3 formats: Block, Standard and Extended. I was thinking of playing block but shifted to standard at the last minute because I only had one Mutavault.

This was deck I assembled on Saturday:

Of course I went in again with no playtesting. Enjoyment. Tournament report follows.

Round 1: UB Faeries
   
** 

It&'s basically impossible to join a standard tournament without seeing UB Faeries. This matchup is a race, since usually there&'s no blocking involved. But I felt confident since they have Bitterblossom and I have Psionic Blast, so I had a lower damage target. However, the main enemy in this matchup is Cryptic Command, since it stalls one round of damage which is huge in such a close race. I won game one easily since I got a nuts draw and my opponent seemed not used to playing against the fish.

I &#8216;m not sure exactly how I sideboarded here but it was almost certainly wrong, as I remember changing my board decisions 2 or 3 times. I proceeded to lose games two and three, although game three was very close. My opponent had boarded in more removal (4 Shriekmaws) which meant I almost never had a lord on the board &#8211; good choice.

Games 1-2 Matches 0-1

<span style="font-weight: bold"><br /> Round 2: UBw Control (with Reveillark)<br /> <br /> </span>

I&'m not sure how the opponent could possibly win here; the matchup is very similar to Faeries, except that my guys are unblockable. The normal plan is to have 3-6 guys in play by turn 3, then just use permission to stop Wraths/Damnations/whatever. Delay is excellent in this matchup since you send the Damnation back three turns where he&'s hopefully dead. I think I boarded in +2 Sower -2 random dorks, and won in three games.

Games 3-3 Matches 1-1

<span style="font-weight: bold"><br /> Round 3: UB Faeries<br /> </span>

Yes, once again Faeries! Game one I had my opponent at one life and she had Bitterblossom out so I thought I would win, but end of turn Scion + Spellstutter + me forgetting to count the Faerie Conclave meant she was able to take me from 17 to 0 in one turn&#8230;

However, I managed to pull ahead and comfortably win games two and three.

Games 5-4 Matches 2-1

<span style="font-weight: bold"><br /> Round 4: UB Faeries<br /> </span>

3 out of 4 opponents now brought this deck. Game one here was very close, as he killed me the turn before Bitterblossom would have killed him. A Cryptic Command decided that race, and he knew enough to play it inside the attack step so that I had no window to play a Merfolk spell to untap a creature.

Game two I mulligan to five, get stuck on one land and promptly lose. My opponent was apologetic about the mana screw, but hey that&'s the way the game works.

Games 5-6 Matches 2-2

<span style="font-weight: bold"><br /> Round 5: UB Faeries<br /> </span>

I didn&'t even bother writing the matchup in the notes anymore, I would surely remember that 4 out of the first five rounds I faced Faeries.

Game one my opponent tried to stay alive by using a Sower on my Lord of Atlantis &#8211; but that doesn&'t actually do anything since my guys get the bonus no matter where the Lord is. I lose game two to fast beats, then in game three I get the nuts draw: Turn 1 &#8211; Suspend Visions, Turn 2 &#8211; Banneret, Turn 3 &#8211; Reejerey, Adept (revealing Adept), untap island, one more Adept (revealing 3rd Adept). I actually had the 4th Adept as well, but I didn&'t want to overcommit to the board. No hope for the opponent&'s survival here&#8230;

Games 7-7 Matches 3-2

**
    
Round 6: BRwu Control
   
** 

A strange controllish deck, I got hit by Avalanche Riders, Reveillarks and Hellkites, etc. I was close to sealing off game one with him at 5 and me holding the PsiBlast, but he manages to get a Tendrils off and I lost after that.

I board in +2 Sower -2 Sage&'s Dousing. I win the next two games easily without drawing the Sowers though&#8230;I just make it a point to be more careful about Tendrils.

Games 9-8 Matches 4-2

**
    
Round 7: Monored Burn
   
** 

Finally, an opponent without islands! It&'s immediately obvious what he&'s playing when his turn 1 is mountain, suspend rift bolt. I take some hits, and he chooses to point his burn at me instead of my critters, which I think is a mistake. Against a straight control deck that&'s fine, but this one is an aggro-control swarm; I only need to make sure his burn doesn&'t deal the twentieth point of damage and surely my creatures can finish the job. At least, that was the plan, until he played Crusher and suspended Big Gargs. I kept chumping the Crusher while waiting for my answer &#8211; Sower. When I finally drew it, it forced him to sac the Crusher and he was already in topdeck mode so I just went in, dealing 4-5 points of damage at a time to win the game at one life. The Sage&'s Dousing and Silvergill Adepts were awesome in this matchup, ensuring that he loses steam before me.

I board in Flash Freeze for Delays. Second game is much like the first, except he draws no creatures except for a lone Mogg Fanatic which he sacs to off a Banneret, and he&'s also mana flooded. He&'s learned from the first game and keeps killing the lords, but eventually even the 1/1s manage to kill him. I ended the game at a comfortable 4 life, holding 2 flash freeze and a sage&'s dousing.

Final record:

Games 11-8, Matches 5-2, #15

I win a Morningtide Booster, and the rare is

Idyllic Tutor!

To be honest, I&'m glad to win anything at all, as I haven&'t won anything since the Morningtide Release event.

Well, that wasn&'t bad for a deck put together quicky with no playtesting at all. I wasn&'t able to use the Surgespanners, which I had hoped to use against &#8216;Lark but after getting a feel of the deck the Surgespanners seem a bit too slow. Still, the deck is a pretty good choice for the meta. It has about an even chance with Faeries, I think it has a positive matchup against slow control decks and with a little luck can even survive against monored burn, even without Dragon Claws or Bottle Gnomes. I&'ve always preferred turning men sideways in order to win, so I find this deck appeals to me more than &#8216;Lark.

What will I play next week? Stay tuned!
