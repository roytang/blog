I was neglecting the NDS a bit, so I decided to look for some fun homebrew stuff to do with it. Here are some I tried (You&#8217;ll need some sort of flashcart to use these. Mine is an R4.):
 
  


  * [
     
    Pocket Physics
    
][1] 
    
    &#8211; a neat little toy app that allows you to draw diagrams on the touch screen that would then become affected by physics. It&#8217;s a bit like a free-form
    
    [
     
    The Incredible Machine
    
][2] 
    
    that&#8217;s portable. It&#8217;s a bit of work to get a nice physics model done, but there are some available for download, you can just view the work of others if you want. 
  * [
     
    Colors!
    
][3] 
    
    &#8211; a painting/sketching app for the DS, you can create images that have a painting feel to them 
  * [
     
    ScummVM DS
    
][4] 
    
    &#8211; SCUMM was the adventure-game engine that drove a lot of the point-and-click adventure games of the 80s such as the Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion games. Provided you have a copy of those games, ScummVM DS allows you to play all those old games on your DS! 


   
There&#8217;s a whole world of homebrew apps/games out there to explore, these were just the ones I could try out in one sitting. Try

this post from 4-color-rebellion

for some recommendations.

For more details, you can also check out the recently concluded

Now if you&#8217;ll excuse me, I&#8217;m trying to help Guybrush find Big Whoop&#8230;
