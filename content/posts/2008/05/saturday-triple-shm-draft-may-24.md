I couldn&#8217;t leave work early again last May 24, so I settled for signing up to a booster draft.

Unfortunately, the draft itself didn&#8217;t go well. I tried going with either red/green or red/black first, but wasn&#8217;t getting enough good cards. I eventually settled on picking up the many blue fliers that were passing by and eventually ended up in Uw. I was still undecided and still picked from red/black occasionally in pack two until the third pack where I cracked Thistledown Liege. (I also picked Ashenmoor Liege later in the pack). I ended with around 18 R/x cards in my draft pool so my U/w deck wasn&#8217;t very solid and I had to put in a bunch of filler and also splashed for Burn Trail and Ember Gale.

I still managed to go 3-1 despite that, with some lucky matchups. Most of the other decks had trouble dealing with my multitude of fliers, especially if I manage to
   
[Spectral Procession][1]
   
into
   
[Thistledown Liege][2]

In the only match I lost I basically had no chance anyway; the guy&#8217;s deck had like 2 Tattermunge Duo, 2 Puncture Bolt, 2 Scar, 1 Flame Javelin, 1 Boartusk Liege, 1 Tattermunge Witch&#8230;and those were just the cards I saw!

Rares I drafted:
   
[Mystic Gate][3]
   
,
   
[Vexing Shusher][4]
   
,
   
[Ashenmoor Liege][5]
   
,
   
[Thistledown Liege][2]
   
.

I won two packs, containing
   
[Runed Halo][6]
   
and
   
[Primastic Omen][7]
   
.
