In case you haven&#8217;t heard, [Firefox][1], the little browser that could, is scheduled for the official 1.0 release on Nov. 9. There&#8217;s a large promotion campaign going on over at [SpreadFirefox.com][2], including a campaign to gather donations for a large ad of some sort on the New York Times. I&#8217;m still using 0.9, despite the availability of 1.0PR, but I&#8217;ll surely get the official 1.0 come November 9. 😀

BTW, there are some [cool Firefox wallpapers][3] available.
