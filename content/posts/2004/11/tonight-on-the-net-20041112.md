  * Interesting read: There&#8217;s this [spouse of an EA developer ][1]who&#8217;s taking it to EA&#8217;s supposedly unfair labor practices on livejournal.
  * Cool thing: A [chess program ][2]that shows you the computer&#8217;s train of thought!
  * [Interesting English Trivia ][3]&#8211; yes it&#8217;s geeky 😀
  * Tech news: [Winamp is dead, long live Winamp!
  
][4] I actually like Winamp, especially version 5. There are quite a number of things I&#8217;d like to change with it, but it&#8217;s a lot better than WMP. I wonder if there are any other, better (or at least promising) alternatives?
  * People who have too much time on their hands: [&#8216;King of Pirates&#8217; ][5]has downloaded more than 900,000 songs!
