Yup. This week, for the first time ever, I&'m leaving the country, and flying down to HK to provide support for the rollout of the project I&'ve been with for the past year and a half. First time to leave the country, and I&'m gonna be flying alone to a country where people speak a language I can recognize but not understand. I&'m understandably a bit freaked out; who wouldn&'t be, right? But everything will be fine, I guess.
