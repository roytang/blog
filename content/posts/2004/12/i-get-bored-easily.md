And that explains why this blog&'s layout has changed again.

I would have posted this (and some other stuff) earlier, but I was in AN ETERNITY OF PAIN for the past two and a half hours. I would like to take this time to berate my stupid, stupid impacted molar, and the stupid, stupid painkillers that took over two hours to kick in. Along with my stupid, stupid thyroid gland, which, because of hyperthyroidism, prevents me from having dental surgery on this sucker.

I will also thank God profusely for releasing me from this ETERNITY OF PAIN. It&'s times like these I am glad I believe in a deity from whom I can request deliverance.

Did I mention how painful it was? All the way to my left ear, damnit.
