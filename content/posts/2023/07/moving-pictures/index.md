title: 'Books: Moving Pictures by Terry Pratchett (Discworld #10)'

**Moving Pictures** is Discworld book 10, finished reading this last night! If the title isn't obvious, this one is a parody of the motion picture industry, and involves alchemists discovering how to make moving pictures or "clicks" as they call them, and how the frentic nature of film-making starts to affect the reality of the Discworld.

The book isn't particularly long, though it's entertaining enough, and I did enjoy the easily identifiable parodies of movie tropes and popular classic films (especially that inversion of King Kong near the end!). It's nice that Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler gets a bigger part in this one, instead of the usual bit parts/cameos that he usually gets. Also, apparently this book is the origin story for Gaspode the Wonder Dog! If any Discworld book should be made into a film, this one seems very appropriate, and a lot of the final act scenes might even look good in live action.

This brings us to [18/41 Discworld](/topics/discworld/) books read! Will maybe try to read at least a couple more this year so we have a decent pace.
