The saga of the
   
[
    
mightiest deck in the universe
   
][1] 
   
continues. My
   
[
    
previous outing
   
][2] 
   
showed me a solid control matchup and maybe 60% aggro matchup. I tweaked the sideboard to improve the aggro game post-board, dropping the useless Yixlid Jailers for 4 Last Gasps.

Here&'s how I did:
   

   
Round 1 2-0 win vs MGA
   

   
Round 2 0-2 loss vs RUW control (no angels)
   

   
Round 3 2-0 win vs RGW mid-range aggro (elephants/avalanche riders)
   

   
Round 4 2-1 win vs RW Boros aggro
   

   
Round 5 2-1 win vs RG Gruul aggro
   

   
Round 6 1-2 loss vs GW aggro
   

   
Round 7 0-2 loss vs RGW Zoo

The below stats are for both tournaments
   

   
total wins: 21
   

   
total losses: 13
   

   
win% ratio (total): 61%
   

   
wins vs aggro: 15
   

   
losses vs aggro: 10
   

   
win% ratio vs aggro: 60%
   

   
wins vs control: 6
   

   
losses vs control: 3
   

   
win% ratio vs control: 67%

Obviously, I did a lot worse than the previous tournament, as all my percentages dropped. Probably due to the fact that I actually went to work before going to the tournament (which meant I had a lot less sleep&#8230;), I made too many bad plays in the first two losses. There&'s an
   
[
    
article today
   
][3] 
   
on magicthegathering.com about how you should avoid racing aggro and avoid taking damage as much as possible&#8230;I think I basically violated every single principle in that article during those losing matches. Yes, even the lone control matchup &#8211; I didn&'t kill a Hellkite thinking I would just race it with Korlash, but the Bust on his turn sealed my fate.

The GW aggro loss hurt &#8211; I lost the last game because I was at three, he had a Saffi, all I had was a 9/9 Korlash with a Temporal Isolation on it and I didn&'t notice my opponent had a Vitu-ghazi and I thought I could survive one more turn with one life. If I had just taken out his Saffi with the Demonfire I had in hand instead of waiting to burn him to 0&#8230;I would have drawn a House Guard next turn, transmute for Tendrils, swing with Korlash, stack damage and cast Tendrils on Korlash for an 18-point life swing.

The round 6 loss really broke my spirit, I was in such a bad mental state that I played badly in the round 7 zoo matchup. Not that having perfectly tight play would have helped &#8211; he had the zoo god draws both games, I was down to eight before I even had Damnation mana.

Lessons learned:
   

   
* Never, ever try to race with damage. I may have bigger beats, but I&'m usually behind on life. I should always take out threats until I can stabilize with Tendrils.
   

   
* I need to become mentally stronger, so that play mistakes from previous losses don&'t affect succeeding games.

Seeing as how the local metagame is maybe 60-70% aggro, I&'ll also probably tweak the deck to make the maindeck stronger against aggro and move some of the control hate to the board.

Next stop: Regionals.
