Obviously, I&'ve started playing a lot of Magic since last year. I&'ve been a long-time player, having started around the time of Revised more than twelve years ago, but I&'ve never seriously started playing in tournaments in such until I had a job, which meant more money to spend on Magic (also meant less free time though =/)

As anyone who has immersed himself in this game knows, Magic is an addictive experience. When you&'re in the thick of it you&'re always thinking of new decks, card interactions, etc. hopefully to make yourself a better player. Lately I&'ve been thinking of writing more about Magic, but

has been mostly filled with Magic posts lately, so I thought it better to just create a separate space for writing about Magic.

So, here we go: Roy on Magic.
