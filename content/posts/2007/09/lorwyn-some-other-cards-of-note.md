Lorwyn prerelease and two days, and of course MTG Salvation is
   
[
    
spoiler-complete
   
][1] 
   
.  Some thoughts on cards:

**
    
Thoughtseize
   
** 
   
&#8211; B
   

   
Sorcery (Rare)
   

   
Target player reveals his or her hand. Choose a nonland card from it. That player discards that card.
   

   
You lose 2 life.

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
Undercosted cards that demand a 2 life payment are usually pretty good. (See: Shocklands, Char, Psionic Blast, Vampiric Tutor). Thoughtseize is widely anticipated to be the chase rare of the set, with starcitygames.com pre-order prices starting at a staggering 17.50 USD. That seems bit too high for a utility spell though, so I&'m not going to go out of my way to get them yet. Although I wouldn&'t mind opening one or two this weekend.

**
    
Incandescent Soulstoke
   
** 
   
&#8211; 2R
   

   
Creature &#8211; Elemental Shaman (Rare)
   

   
Other Elemental creatures you control get +1/+1.
   

   
{1}{R}, {T}: You may put an Elemental creature card from your hand into play. That creature gains haste until end of turn. Sacrifice it at end of turn.
   

   
2/2

**
    
Nova Chaser
   
** 
   
&#8211; 3R
   

   
Creature &#8211; Elemental Warrior (Rare)
   

   
Trample
   

   
Champion an Elemental
   
_
    
(When this comes into play, sacrifice it unless you remove another Elemental you control from the game. When this leaves play, return that card to play.)
   
_ 
  

   
10/2

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
The elemental deck almost builds itself. (Most of the tribe decks do, actually) I hope one or both of the above rares are in the precon, that makes &'em easier to get. With the elemental harbinger, I can see a toolbox-type elemental deck that can use various evoke elementals and giants like Nova Chaser to finish &'em off.  Lots of possibilities here actually. Force of Savagery pops in for 9? Pandemonium? Fatal Frenzy? Elementals are hot, and I&'m not talking about just the Flamekin.

**
    
Eyes of the Wisent
   
** 
   
&#8211; 1G
   

   
Tribal Enchantment &#8211; Elemental (Rare)
   

   
Whenever an opponent plays a spell during your turn, you may put a 4/4 green Elemental creature token into play.

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
Is this the end of Draw-Go style decks?!?

**
    
Doran, the Siege Tower
   
** 
   
&#8211; BGW
   

   
Legendary Creature &#8211; Treefolk Shaman (Rare)
   

   
Each creature assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.

&#8220;Each year that passes rings you inwardly with memory and might. Wield your heart, and the world will tremble.&#8221;
   
_ 
  

   
0/5

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
I think my jaw literally dropped when this was previewed. Midrange decks will love this guy. Thoughtseize provides disruption, and Doran gives the cheap beats. A &#8220;Rock&#8221; style deck may be in the offing.

**
    
Vivid Creek
   
** 
  

   
Land (Uncommon)
   

   
Vivid Creek comes into play tapped with two charge counters on it.
   

   
{T}: Add {U} to your mana pool.
   

   
{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Creek: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
There&'s a good chance I&'d like this land cycle better than the rare ones. I think Gemstone Mine just became stupid. The red one may be the best, as it facilitates a mostly-red elemental deck splashing for various evokers.

**
    
Hoofprint of the Stag
   
** 
   
&#8211; 1W
   

   
Tribal Enchantment &#8211; Elemental (Rare)
   

   
Whenever you draw a card, you may put a hoofprint counter on Hoofprint of the Stag.
   

   
{2}{W}, Remove four hoofprint counters from Hoofprint of the Stag: Put a 4/4 white Elemental creature token with flying into play. Play this ability only during your turn.

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
I don&'t think it&'s a tier-one card, but one can&'t help imagine the mischief created by turn 2 Hoofprint, turn 3 Hoofprint, turn 4 Careful Consideration.

**
    
Goldmeadow Stalwart
   
** 
   
&#8211; W
   

   
Creature &#8211; Kithkin Soldier (Uncommon)
   

   
As an additional cost to play Goldmeadow Stalwart, reveal a Kithkin card from your hand or pay {3}.
   

   
2/2

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
The comparison to Isamaru is obvious of course, as is the reason the Lions were pulled out of the Core Set. That said, I like the next guy better&#8230;

**
    
Wren&'s Run Vanquisher
   
** 
   
&#8211; 1G
   

   
Creature &#8211; Elf Warrior (Uncommon)
   

   
As an additional cost to play Wren&'s Run Vanquisher, reveal an Elf card from your hand or pay {3}.
   

   
Deathtouch
   
_
    
(Whenever this creature deals damage to a creature, destroy that creature.)
   
_ 
  

   
3/3

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
I like this better than the red or white equivalents. Face it, if Isamaru were in the same standard as 3/3 for 1G with deathtouch, he might not have been able to swing on turn 2 that often. That being said, I could see a deck with 4 Goldmeadow Stalwart and 4 Wren&'s Run Vanquishe&#8230;that&'s a lot of speed. And it also puts you in the correct colors for the next card.

**
    
Gaddock Teeg
   
** 
   
&#8211; GW
   

   
Legendary Creature &#8211; Kithkin Advisor (Rare)
   

   
Noncreature spells with converted mana cost 4 or greater can&'t be played.
   

   
Noncreature spells with {X} in their mana costs can&'t be played.
   

  
_
    
So great is his wisdom and spirit that many who have met him say that they stood before a giant of a man and talked to the wisest of the four winds.
   
_ 
  

   
2/2

**
    
My take:
   
** 
   
This guy stops Force of Will. Oh and Wrath of God and Damnation. That W/G aggro deck is looking pretty good. Throw in some Changeling effects (to facilitate the Vanquisher and the Stalwart) and you&'re good to go. Not sure how well such a deck would fare in standard, but Block Constructed seems to be a given.

That&'s all for today!
