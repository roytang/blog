I bought a new phone yesterday.

At the recommendation of my brother, I got one from the Nokia N-series, the Nokia N73. As a relatively recent smartphone release, it cost quite a chunk of cash. I was having second thoughts for a while, because I&#8217;m almost never comfortable parting with a significant amount of cash. If I&#8217;m going to spend more than a week&#8217;s salary on something, it better provide me with a decent amount of entertainment

I was also hesitant, because I didn&#8217;t really need a new phone. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m the type of guy that buys shiny new stuff just so he can show off to other people. Hell, I&#8217;ve avoided having a phone until, what 2005? Getting a smartphone is pretty much an indulgence. I&#8217;m not buying a new phone so much as I am buying a new toy. As I said to one of my officemates &#8220;I want a phone that I can really tinker with.&#8221;

That being said, I&#8217;m sort of settling into the purchase now that the exchange has been made. I like the camera handy. I like having an MP3 player handy. I also find a phone useful. So having all of these functions in one device is pretty okay I guess. Ooh and it also has a radio! How quaint!

I would post a picture, but I&#8217;m not yet sure how I can get the phone to take a picture of itself.
