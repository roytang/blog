I played the
   
[
    
same deck
   
][1] 
   
again this past weekend, but I forgot to name it &#8220;Nameless Deck Wins&#8221; this time, so I posted a much worse record. =(

I went 2-3-drop, with the losses all going to aggro decks (2 Boros, 1 KarstenBot). The Boros matchup is winnable, but really tight, with no room for error.

Anyway, with Planar Chaos coming out, my colors (Red/Green/Black) look like they&'re getting a good boost, so hopefully I can further improve this deck. And hopefully think of a better name.
