A couple of weeks ago, just before the last PTQ of the season, I was thinking of quitting Magic. Not because I&#8217;m tired of it or anything, but because I&#8217;ve run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.

There are only two of us seriously playing now, so our card pool has become so much smaller. That also means less preparation for constructed formats as it&#8217;s harder to get serious playtesting done. Having a team and a shared card pool makes a huge difference. You can see this easily because so many of the players that repeatedly hit top 8 in the local tourneys are known members of a team.

I&#8217;m not  sure how I&#8217;ll proceed next year, but I&#8217;m not quitting. I love to play the game and will make do with what I have if I need to. I&#8217;m even contemplating playing in the Extended PTQs, although how I can gather the needed cards for that is still a mystery!
