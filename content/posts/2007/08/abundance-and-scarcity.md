When at home or at the office, if I ever get a craving for something to snack on I can usually find some easily. At home I just go down to the kitchen and check the ref or the cupboards. At the office, there&'s always the pantry or those people you know that usually store some snacks. If I need something, I can get it fairly easily. This is something of an abundance situation.

By contrast, for the two weeks I was in HK, I had no snacks. None at all. I literally ate only three meals a day and nothing more. Sometimes less. If I got hungry while staying at the hostel, it would be too troublesome to go out and buy some snacks. Breakfast would usually be just some bread that we&'d buy at a bakeshop on the way to work. Dinner would be whatever fastfood we decided to eat at that day. There&'s something of a scarcity mentality.

Obviously, I was able to survive just fine without snacks for two weeks, so why don&'t I do that? Somehow I think eating more makes me more sleepy during the day, so i would benefit my productivity. I suppose that the abundance mentality makes me eat more even though I don&'t need it. To store up for times of scarcity?
