No matter how much of an optimist I am, I have to admit all people will have down cycles. The last few days seem to be one of mine.

Health-wise: My stomach has been in a rebellious mood for the past three or four days, I actually went to work with a fever last Friday. Also, it seems my blood pressure was a bit high since yesterday. I&'m thinking about going in for a checkup within the next week or so, depending on how my condition changes.

Work-wise: Annoying problems which we&'ve been trying to solve for the past few weeks seem to be snowballing into a critical mass that threatens to derail the current project. I feel so guilty here because at least one of those problems were caused by some really bad design decisions I made early on in the project. Ah, the pitfalls of being a rookie technical lead&#8230;

Well, now that I&'ve written this stuff down, I guess it isn&'t so bad. Work is work, whatever happens won&'t kill me. The health stuff might, but I&'ve never let it get me down before, why start now?
