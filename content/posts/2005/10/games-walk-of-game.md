Voting for the
   
[
    
Walk of Game
   
][1] 
   
is up. 

My votes were: Starcraft, Civilization, Final Fantasy and Street Fighter II. Also Sid Meier and the Pac-man guy. 

Edit: After some thought, it&#8217;s kind of silly to have a poll where you could vote everyday. There&#8217;s no chance for Pac-man to beat Final Fantasy here, as FF has an army of fanboys willing to vote everyday, and Pac-man&#8230;well, a lot of his fans might vote once buy many won&#8217;t even realize or care that they can vote again.
