Freedom from work at least. I&'ve been meaning to take a two-week leave since late last year, but never found a chance. Now is the perfect time, just before I jump full-swing into the next large project (which may or may not be confidential in nature)

So, no thinking about work for two weeks, unless they call me in for an emergency :(

What stuff do I have planned? I&'m not skipping town or anything. As I keep telling people, if I plan it, it&'s not free time! But I do have some stuff I want to get around to, I&'ll let you in if anything&'s interesting :p
