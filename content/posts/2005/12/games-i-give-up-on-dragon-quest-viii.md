Not that it&'s a bad game mind you. From the ten or so hours I&'ve played it&'s definitely a lot better than the previous game in the series. And the voice acting is really great this time, with a bunch of British people doing the over-the-top voices. The battle system is still a bit simplistic, and the main quest seems very straightforward. From what I&'ve seen, it&'s probably an above average game. 

That&'s the problem. I don&'t have time for above average games. It was okay when I was still in school and had tons of free time, I could afford to waste my time with midcarders like Legend of Legaia or Wild Arms, but these days there are so many things competing for my attention (thanks DSL), and work sched is a lot more tight than school, so I have to be a LOT more selective in my choice of distractions. 

And &#8220;above-average&#8221; just doesn&'t make the cut anymore.
