Yeah I know, Hong Kong is technically a part of China, but my feet actually did manage to walk some non-Hong Kong Chinese territory. Too many stories accumulated in three weeks to tell in [one post][1] though, but to say the least I actually got to experience a bit more of Hong Kong this time, as opposed to the five-day almost-all-work schedule that I had last time.

Unfortunately, I did not get to experience any kung-fu in the streets, although I did manage to get a picture with Jacky Chan.
