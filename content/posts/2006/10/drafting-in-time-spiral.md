Played four 4-man drafts last night, opening 2 boxes.

Some interesting draft archetypes:
   

   
* White Weenie &#8211; easy. If you get a Celestial Crusader early this is a good choice.
   

   
* Black Weenine &#8211; a bit tougher, you have to get a bad moon early
   

   
* Slivers &#8211; W/U combinations focus on board lock down and pinging to win. R/G combinations focus on acceleration and beatdown.
   

   
* Thallids &#8211; tedious and slow. Don&#8217;t do it. If you keep getting passed Sporesowers it may be viable, or if you open an early Thelon. The Thalld Shell-Dweller is an excellent early blocker. The Deathspore Thallid is ok.
   

   
* Blue morphers &#8211; I did this in one game, I think I got one of each nonrare blue morpher. Fledgling Mawcor gives you board control, Fathom Seer gives you card advantage, and Brine Elemental locks the opponent down for a turn, allowing the alpha strike. Consider this if you get Vesuvan Shapeshifter early, but you might need to splash a second color for more control.

Red seems the color that&#8217;s hardest to stand alone with, but is easily splashable.
