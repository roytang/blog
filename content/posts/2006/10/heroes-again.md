This series is simple awesome. The writing is excellent, and the fact they're using a lot of precognition implies how well the entire series should tie together.

Hiro continues to be the shining star here. Future Hiro's appearance promises us several things, namely:

* Hiro will eventually stop being so dorky. And he'll get a sword!

* Hiro will eventually learn to speak English well

* Peter will eventually get a scar

* In some future episode, they have to show us what happened to prompt Future Hiro's sojourn to the past

TV just keeps getting better. Between Heroes and other series like 24, TV is a lot better to watch than movies now. (Not that I watch the series on TV mind you.)
