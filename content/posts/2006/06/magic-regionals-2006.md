I played at Robinson&#8217;s Galleria last Saturday. So much for my first constructed outing in 10 years&#8230;not a very good outcome for me.

I played 4-color Firemane Control&#8230;no permission, but lots of life gain and 4 Wrath of Gods packed maindeck, a specifically anti-aggro build. I was anticipating lots of Gruul beats and Orzhov aggro decks, and I was ready to beat them to the ground. Unfortunately, I faced not a single one of those decks. :(

Round 1 vs Wildfire/Vore
   

   
I knew this was a loss as soon as he boomerang&#8217;ed a Temple Garden on the second turn. First game went fast, I lost to Niv-Mizzet. Second game, he brought out the early Blood Moon, but I had a Hinder ready. The second Blood Moon made it through, so for the rest of the game I only had a Simic Signet providing me with colored mana. Keiga got killed by another Keiga, and he had two cards left in hand. I had two Angels in the &#8216;yard, but no white for removal and no permission in hand. I said, what the heck, and played the Zur&#8217;s Weirding. He shows me Magnivore and Wildfire in hand. Oh crap. The 7/7 Magnivore took 4 swings to kill me.

Round 2 vs The Masterpiece
   

   
It was my first time seeing the Masterpiece and action, and to be honest, the first few turns weren&#8217;t very impressive. We traded Hierarchs, creatures were killed by spot removal, it was an even game. Then he plays an Arena, and I realize &#8220;It&#8217;s over.&#8221; I can match him threat for threat, but he&#8217;s drawing a lot more than I am, and I don&#8217;t draw into the maindecked Stomphowler. Game 2 goes pretty much the same way, except I get hit by Persecute &#8211; White&#8230;and the secret of this deck is 80% of my spells are white! I go down to one card in hand. He Cranials the 4 Wrath of Gods and the 4 Firemane Angels&#8230;and there&#8217;s no recovering from that.

Round 3 vs Owling Mine
   

   
I would&#8217;ve thought this was a bad matchup, but the first game went surprisingly well. The extra card draws were great for me, and even when he played an owl, two Angels in the &#8216;yard kept the damage down. Eventually, he ran out of life to give and we started sideboarding. I knew exactly what to board, brought in 3 Grand Arbiters and 3 Hide/Seek. 2nd game went really well for him, Owl on 2nd turn, Boomerang a land, exhaustion, game went fast. Game 3 took a lot longer, he played 3 Owls in one turn, but I had two Hide/Seeks in hand. I kept on tapping out to play threats, hoping he wouldn&#8217;t draw into an exhaustion. With one turn before I kill him, he amps up the card drawing and gets me to 11 cards in hand, planning to toss two Sudden Impacts at me. But he realizes he&#8217;s one short &#8211; I&#8217;m at 23 life. Besides, I have a helix in hand which forces him to scoop. Finally a win!

Round 4 vs The Masterpiece AGAIN
   

   
Yeah, same story here. I think my mistake was I keep shooting down Fetters instead of Arenas&#8230;but eh, the deck is really far superior.

Round 5 vs Greater Good
   

   
Well, my back is starting to ache by now. One of the guys I came here with managed to get a monoblock chair with a back&#8230;oh what I would give for that. Oh yeah, the game. I ate a lot of Kokushos and Yoseis, that&#8217;s what I remember. And he kept using the Top every turn. After a while I stopped caring and didn&#8217;t even check whether he was cheating me with the Top or not.

Anyway, it was about 5 PM at that time, and there were 3 rounds to go. But I figured I wouldn&#8217;t make it anyway, and I had to catch up on work, so I said goodbye to the guys and went back to the office.

Most important lesson learned: Next time, just play aggro. With an eight-round tournament, playing a control deck is likely to give you a migraine by round four or five. And the metagame is so wide, it&#8217;s useless trying to prepare for everything anyway, so just throw caution to the winds and send your creatures in the red zone. Oh yeah, a Gruul deck which I helped prepare (the base of the deck came from me) did a lot better than me&#8230;his record was 3-2 by the fifth round.
