title: Trying out 3d Modelling with Blender

I decided to try learning some 3d modeling. For the past couple of weeks I&#8217;ve been following this beginner [Blender][1] tutorial where I had to make donuts. ([Link to the tutorial series on Youtube][2].) Here&#8217;s my output!<figure id="attachment_2554" style="width: 150px" class="wp-caption aligncenter">

[<img class="wp-image-2554 size-thumbnail" src="http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donut4-150x150.png" alt="" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donut4-150x150.png 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donut4-100x100.png 100w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />][3]<figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(click for full size)</figcaption></figure> 

This image took around 40 minutes to render. I had to do 2000 samples per tile which is why it was so slow. I was getting too much noise/graininess at lower sampling rates.

I didn&#8217;t follow the tutorial exactly. My plate is square and made of glass for one thing. The chocobutternut donut wasn&#8217;t part of the tutorial, I just wanted to try it (obviously did not turn out too well and all those orange particles on the donut probably really slowed down the render lol). I also didn&#8217;t bother too much with the stuff in the last two videos of the series which involved adjusting the lighting and other stuff to make the image prettier (wasn&#8217;t really interested). I actually also tried to model a fork (not in the tutorial), but I couldn&#8217;t get the tines right and gave up.

A long time ago I read an interview in an old PC gaming mag about how they implemented Age of Empires and there was an image of a 3d mesh of a knight on horseback and I remember thinking &#8220;That looks really complicated, I&#8217;ll probably never be able to do something like that.&#8221;

And now that I&#8217;ve tried this tutorial, I have to agree with that initial assessment &#8211; any complex modelling would surely try my patience. But I was also pleasantly surprised with how advanced Blender is &#8211; I sort of imagined that you had to position and adjust all the mesh nodes/vertices/faces by hand a lot, but actually there&#8217;s a ton of functions to make some common operations simpler (but it&#8217;s still a lot of work).

One complaint is that Blender&#8217;s user interface is very obtuse and daunting though &#8211; I don&#8217;t usually do video tutorials but I doubt I could have figured this stuff out on my own. Though I suppose it can&#8217;t be helped given the sheer complexity of the task involved.

I&#8217;m probably not going into any sort of significant 3d modelling or 3d artwork soon (like I said, not enough patience), but it was good to give it a try so at least I have a passing knowledge of some of the concepts involved.
