There&#8217;s a lot of doom and gloom and bad news in the world these days, giving us ordinary folk little reason to be optimistic. Examples include:

  * we are almost certainly too late to prevent climate change at all and [social collapse is now an actual possibility][1]
  * Trump has begun taking steps to walk back a [nuclear arms control treaty][2]
  * increasing trends of nationalism and populism threatening to walk back the gains of globalisation (i.e. Brexit) and diversity
  * Elon Musk warns us of the existential threat of artificial intelligence  
    
  * locally, some friends of mine are largely pessimistic about the future of Philippine society as it seems that we are falling further into the trap of autocratic leanings and dynasty-driven patronage

I wonder if things are looking so bad because we are coming from a period of relative peace and expansion of liberal democracy the past few decades (not saying things are perfect, but at least we haven&#8217;t gotten into any world wars recently). Maybe some of the societal and cultural problems highlighted above may be nothing more than society trying to find a new equilibrium in an age of political correctness and social justice. Climate change is of course, a game changing problem that we as a society seem to be unable to face or control.&nbsp; 

I like to think of myself as an optimist, but even I am increasingly wary of where our world and my country are heading. I am slightly comforted by the words of an American novelist, which I heard from the recent season of Daredevil:  


<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
  <p>
    “Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat.”
  </p>
  
  <cite>&#8211; Ralph Ellison</cite>
</blockquote>

We have to hold out hope that humanity and society can adapt and survive these crises, that we have not come all this way simply to lose to our own hubris.
