Rockstar was in the gaming news recently because they mentioned that some of them had [worked 100-hour weeks][1] on their massive sequel to Red Dead Redemption coming out soon (no idea if I&#8217;ll play this). The idea of 100 hour weeks seemed insane to me, and it got me thinking: I&#8217;ve done some serious overtime before, have I ever gotten close to that amount of work in a week?

Luckily, I didn&#8217;t have to speculate too much, because I had data (I love data). My previous employer had us track and log our work hours, and I had kept a copy of my own data after I left. That&#8217;s working hours from 2003-2015. I crunched the numbers and I found that:

  * I had 633 weeks of data in all, from 2003 to 2015  
    
  * I had 239 weeks where I worked more than 40 hours
  * I had 60 weeks where I worked more than 50 hours
  * I had 15 weeks where I worked more than 60 hours.
  * My record for number of hours in a single week was week 34 of 2015 where I had a whopping 80.50 hours in a single week. This was when I was deployed on-site to London and was also on call for support at the same time, so basically working all the time.

So luckily I&#8217;ve not been in the &#8220;100-hour week&#8221; situation that the RDR2 team found them in (though I came close). I&#8217;m not sure if this is an accurate representation of what it&#8217;s like to work in the software industry in general, though I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s typical of my former workplace. Hopefully, overtime is something I can avoid or minimize in my own career moving forward.
