Since I got Windows XP a little less than a year ago, I've tried looking around for cheap (read: free) ways to customize the interface. I did eventually find some solutions, but after trying a nice chrome theme for a while, I eventually went back to the default XP look. Why? I realize now, I like the Luna interface. It's neat. It's one of the best things to come out of Microsoft in eight years.
