How's work you ask? It's going pretty well actually. Everything's still easy-peasy for me as I'm undergoing some training and stuff. I'm a bit worried about what happens after the training though, from the looks of it people put in a lot of overtime here. :( The best thing about the job is that I'm learning a lot of stuff. In two weeks I learned SQL, PL/SQL and Delphi. Starting tomorrow I'm gonna be training on Oracle Developer. The work itself looks easy enough &#8212; nothing I can't handle. Since most of the coding is done using high-level RAD Tools, I should be fine. On a side note, it's a weird feeling actually having access to money. It's like everything looks different because there's always the possibility of buying stuff. On another side note, I'm paying a lot in taxes. My annual salary is like a couple of ten thousand above the minimum for my bracket. It's irritating.
