* Well, not exactly. But I am now 25, in any case. Looking back, there are many
  
    things I might have regretted, but my life philosphy tells me that there can be
  
    no regrets. The past is past, and the future is yet to come. Somehow, I'm only
  
    a few steps closer towards achieving my lifetime goals, but my gut tells me to
  
    keep on dreaming. Such is the folly of a dreamer.
  * In case you're wondering, my lifetime goals include becoming an accomplished
  
    indie game developer, and world domination. There are more, but these are the
  
    ones that are most constant. Yes, I'm serious about the world domination part!
  * Anyway, I'm glad I finally got some free time. Work's been a bitch lately,
  
    but I had to call in sick today due to an unfortunate (or fortunate?) case of LBM.
  
    Filipinos in the audience know what I'm talking about. Truth be told I would've
  
    taken the slightest excuse to get off work. It's better to be absent
  
    today since the workload is rather light while we're waiting for the UAT results,
  
    rather than being absent when we have to cram for deadlines. Gee, I wonder if my
  
    officemates are reading this. ^_^
