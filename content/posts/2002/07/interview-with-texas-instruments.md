Sometimes my still being unemployed depresses me greatly (Although my periods of depression typically last no more than thirty minutes.)

The biggest problem in my job-hunting woes is the fact that the type of job I want varies greatly from what I have training in. I want to be involved in IT or programming, but I don&'t have a lot of the skills necessary to succeed in those fields. I will probably always regret not shifting to Computer Science or even Computer Engineering early on in college. If I had I would&'ve probably had a much easier time.

In any case, I&'m going for an interview with Texas instruments on Friday. The job is not an optimum one for me &#8212; I don&'t really want to work as a product engineer although I am qualified. (Heck the chances of my being accepted are probably too small for me to even consider &#8212; I have the requirements but I&'m sure a lot more qualified people will be applying. I&'ll have to wow &'em with my incorrigible attitude). But the pay is probably good, it involves overseas training and if I get accepted it&'ll mean I have something to do in the meantime as I try to earn the skills needed for a job that I \_would\_ enjoy.

Hopefully the TI guys never read this. O_o
