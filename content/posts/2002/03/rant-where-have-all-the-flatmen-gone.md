(Originally available on the now-defunct NFT Zu website)

(2018 Edit: I found this in my WordPress drafts folder, not sure why it wasn&'t published when I first imported it. It&'s true it was on my old site, but I can not find a reliable indicator of what date it was published. So I will publish it with an arbitrarily chosen date of March 1, 2002.)

Officially, this rant should be available upon the re-opening&nbsp;of the NFT Zu webpage, version 4.something. As much as I&'d like&nbsp;to babble on about anime or fanfiction, several of my associates&nbsp;here at the Zu know a lot more about those than I do. So I&'ll&nbsp;stick to something where I can claim some sort of specialized&nbsp;knowledge: video games.

Lately, I&'ve been playing Legend of Mana. It&'s a little-known&nbsp;Square game for the PSX, the fourth installment in the Seiken&nbsp;Densetsu series of games. It&'s a quirky little game, but what&nbsp;will strike you most about the game is the amazing graphics. No,&nbsp;I&'m not talking about FFVIII-style FMVs or such. I&'m talking&nbsp;about the detailed hand-drawn animations. The characters are&nbsp;portrayed by detailed sprites, the backgrounds are colorful,
  
hand-drawn landscapes, nothing like the mundane realism of&nbsp;FMV-based games. Don&'t get me wrong, I&'m not knocking FMV. I&nbsp;certainly appreciate a great CG movie in a game.

But these days practically every game and its mother has FMV,&nbsp;and frankly, I tend to grow tired of it. What&'s wrong with good&nbsp;ol&' 2d animation? We see a lot of games pushing the envelope as&nbsp;far as 3d CG FMVs are concerned, but where are the games pushing&nbsp;the envelope of 2d animation? As Legend of Mana and games like&nbsp;Parappa the Rapper show, there are certainly games and stories&nbsp;which are much better told in 2d animation than the mundane 3d&nbsp;videos of today. And for all their technical sophistication, 3d&nbsp;engines are still far more limited than what hand-drawn animation&nbsp;could show us, visions far closer to the artist&'s
  
imagination.

So where are all the 2d RPGs? Sadly, outside of Square and&nbsp;Capcom, no one seems to be capable of thinking for themselves and&nbsp;differentiating themselves from the pack. In this case the&nbsp;console RPG scene suffers from a common problem: lack of&nbsp;innovation. Aside from a couple of industry leaders, few&nbsp;companies can afford to &#8220;try something different&#8221; when they have&nbsp;sales to make. It&'s far easier to do what everybody else is doing&nbsp;than to try out something which may or may not sell. The 2d RPG&nbsp;seems to be going the way of the handheld, as practically all 2d&nbsp;RPGS these days are being announced for GBA only, with the PS2,&nbsp;XBOX and GC all geared towards powerful 3d apps.

Granted, all of this might be chalked up to the fact that I&'m&nbsp;an old-school gamer of sorts, and you could argue that &#8220;3d is the&nbsp;wave of the future!&#8221; But if you look at Legend of Mana, and its&nbsp;younger SNES brother Secret of Mana, you can&'t help but see how&nbsp;2d animation has improved by leaps and bounds over the years,&nbsp;albeit unnoticed compared to the attention 3d animation has been&nbsp;getting. Five years ago, all these 3d games were getting noticed&nbsp;because they were bringing us something new, a greater sense of&nbsp;realism than what 2d animation could bring. Back then 3d WAS the&nbsp;wave of the future. Today, it IS the future, and 3d games are the
  
norm, and 2d animation offers us something different, something&nbsp;fresh.

What am I saying? I want to see more 2d games, RPGs&nbsp;specifically. I want to see more Saga games, more Mana games,&nbsp;more Breath of Fire. I want to see new sprite-based RPGs. I want&nbsp;to see more fantasy worlds that look fantastic, more anime&nbsp;cut-scenes. Is it all too much to ask?
