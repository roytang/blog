It's market pricing, except the market moves very fast. There is no single entity determining what the prices should be. It's a whole bunch of individual buyers deciding "this is the price I'm willing to buy at" and a whole bunch of individual sellers deciding "this is the price I'm willing to sell at". They adjust until they meet at some point.\n\nThink about how it happens in the real world. Let's say you open a lemonade stand, and you want to make a lot of profit, so you sell lemonade at $100 a glass. Everybody who walks by thinks that ridiculous, so even if they're thirsty, they don't buy your lemonade. Then someone else puts up a lemonade stand near you and sells lemonade for $1 a glass and everyone buys from him. Sellers decide how much they want to sell at, and buyers decide how much they want to buy at, but for transactions to actually happen, the buyers and the sellers need to find prices where other people are willing to transact.\n\nSelling stock works the same way. For any stock, there is a current market value, which is (simplified) the price of the stock for the last transaction it was sold. \n\nIf I want to sell my shares in that stock, I can choose to:\n\n* sell at market value - since someone recently bought at that price, it's likely that someone will buy my shares at that price too\n* Or I can choose to sell at a higher price, and hope that no one else is selling at a lower price (since I would get undercut) and that there's someone willing to buy at that price.\n* Or I could choose to sell at a lower price, since I would be more likely to find buyers that way\n\nBuying a stock goes through a similar decision-making process.\n\nHow do buyers and sellers determine what price to sell at? Everyone has their own rules. People new to stock trading might just stick to market price all the time. Shares in companies that do well (have more profits, etc) are more desirable (because they can give our dividends), so if people think a company is doing well recently, they m
