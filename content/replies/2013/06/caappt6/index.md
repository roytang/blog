Hm, ok let's try another tack. Amperes, joules and watts aren't things that you can see or things that move, they're units of measurement, like a foot or a meter or a mile. When we say "rate" it measures the speed of something like feet per second or miles per hour.\n\nAmperes are something like the speed. When you talk about a car's speed, it's in something like miles per hour right? Amperes are like the speed of electricity (to be specific, electric charge). When you say "this wire has 2 amperes", it means electricity moves through that wire twice as fast as one that only has 1 ampere. Since it's speed, amperes aren't something that's created, it's just a measurement of speed. \n\nJoules are a unit of work or energy. This means joules measure when force is used to move something over some distance. Like if 2 people are carrying some objects over the same distance; if person A is carrying an object that is twice as heavy as the object carried by person B then we can say person A did twice as many joules of work as person B (heavier objects need more force to be carried)\n\nWatts are a unit of measurement for power; power is the speed of work, or how much work is done in a given time. Let's say two people carried the same weight of objects over the same distance, then they both did the same amount of work. But if person A did this work in half the time as person B, then we can say person A used up twice as much power (or twice as many watts) as person B\n\nWhen referring to electricity, joules and watts typically refer to the amount of work or power that was used to generate that electricity. The work/energy is created by machines instead of people. \n\nWhen you have two devices, say device A is rated at 100 watts and device B is rated at 200 watts. This means device B uses up twice as much electrical energy as device A over the same amount of time. It means the machines generating electricity have to work twice as hard over the same amount of time to power that device.
