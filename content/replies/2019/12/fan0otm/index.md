\> **1. Should I register as a self-employed /business?**  
Only if you are earning recurring income not earned under an employer-employee relationship. 

Please explain "recurring income" here? What if I am earning money not on a full-time basis, with no guarantee of recurring income? For example, a company consults with me and I get paid an hourly fee.

Please also explain "employer-employee relationship". I was previously working as a consultant with a company, and they were deducting the withholding tax from me (I think it was 8%). My understanding is I was not an actual employee here since I was a consultant, should I have been registered as a business in this instance? It's just weird since this withholding tax was already reported to the BIR and it seems there was no issue.
