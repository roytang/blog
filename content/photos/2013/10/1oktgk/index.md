#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Is there a way to unbend stacks of foils? I have around five stacks of this size](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1oktgk/is_there_a_way_to_unbend_stacks_of_foils_i_have/)

<time>[2013-10-17 00:00] </time> Additional info: these aren't valuable cards (most of them anyway), just random foils accumulated from years of Magic, so I'm not inclined to sleeve them. When I get a valuable foil I keep it separate (and unbent) or just trade it away.
