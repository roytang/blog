If you&#x27;ll peruse the links David helpfully provided, many of the victims cited there were minors accused of petty crimes. Are you saying they were all killed by policemen who were unable to apprehend them because they were armed and dangerous? Some were shot point blank in the heads, which would set aside any theory of self-defense. You&#x27;re trying to extend the legal right of law enforcement to defend themselves in dangerous situations to other scenarios without basis",
