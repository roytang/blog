It talks about the legality of police officers shooting to kill criminals who are armed and dangerous. Am I correct that you are claiming that *all* the supposed DDS killings were done by policemen in the line of duty in self-defense against armed and dangerous criminals? AFAIK not even Duterte himself claims that. This video seems to be speaking about one particular instance only (IDK the context)",
