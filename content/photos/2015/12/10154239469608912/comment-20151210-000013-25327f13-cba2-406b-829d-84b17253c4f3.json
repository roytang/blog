  "text": "FYI, definition of extrajudicial killings as per wiki: &quot;An extrajudicial killing is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any judicial proceeding or legal process. Extrajudicial punishments are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the due process of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.&quot;    Note the words &quot;governmental authorities&quot;. If it is done by civilian then it would be simply a homicide or murder depending on the intent. Lol    Yup, Davao Provinces are so near that it would not require sophisticated logistics system to tract criminals on the run getting out of the city because there are only 5 provincial road arteries going out of the city. Also I have been to Davao several times and I have seen several police/ military check points set up on these provincial roads - so what special logistics skills are required? If he&#x27;s really good at it, then why did the kidnappers in Samal  Island managed to slip out so easily out of the DUdirty &quot;Davao Provinces&quot; jurisdiction?",
