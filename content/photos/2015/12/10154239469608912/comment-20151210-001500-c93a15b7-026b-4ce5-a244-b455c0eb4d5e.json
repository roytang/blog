Are you claiming that all the alleged summary executions in Davao were by policemen whose lives were endangered because they were in pursuit of armed and dangerous criminals? I thought you said before that you had no personal knowledge of the killings?    BTW, since you decided to bring up this unrelated matter in a thread where I&#x27;m complaining about the way some supporters threaten other people online, I&#x27;d like to take my own tangent: What do you think of Duterte&#x27;s stated preference of hero&#x27;s burial for Marcos and house arrest for GMA?",
