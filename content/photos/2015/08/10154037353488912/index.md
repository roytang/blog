  title: The Lewis chessmen, supposedly the most well known chess set in the world.
    Why haven't I heard of it before? And what happened to that missing rook?

  title: The Royal Game of Ur, some sort of old-school boardgame with weird button
    dice

  title: The Portland Vase. Made from cameo glass, apparently there's only around
    40 samples of cameo glass from olden days (or at least the guide person said)

  title: Some statues recovered from the tomb of a Tang dynasty general. I don't see
    the resemblance

  title: A pendant-mask made from ivory, from Africa. I find that I wasn't as interested
    in the African exhibits as compared to the European ones

  title: The Rosetta Stone. I couldn't get a better picture because of all the tourist.
    I don't think it uses UTF-8

  title: Assyrian Lion Hunt reliefs. Apparently they shot one of the lions out of
    midair

  title: Sculptures from the Parthenon. They should give them back, Greece could use
    the tourist dollars

  title: I'm disappointed that there wasn't a Philippine exhibit (the Asian exhibits
    were mostly Japan, China and India). Also no giant dinosaur skeletons. It was
    nothing like Night at the Museum at all
