While checking to see if Zendikar was already on #magicarena, I found that I still had an unfinished Historic Event with Jeskai Fires. I get to play with banned cards!

oops, went down for maintenance! Hopefully this is still around when it comes back up (and that I dont get the third loss!)

We're back! I decided to wrap this up before drafting Zendikar. When my opponents pause with Fires or Teferi on the stack, I can only assume they are dumbfounded lol

Got my 3rd loss to Rakdos Arcanist, which gives you an idea of how dumb that deck is. Maybe it's safe to bring Teferi and Fires back now? Lol. Anyway, on to Zendikar!
