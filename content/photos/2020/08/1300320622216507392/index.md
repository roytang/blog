Decided to risk my precious gems playing Ikoria Turbo Draft on #magicarena. Turned out well! Just need to draft crystals (essentially moxes). Draw cards and counterspells are great, so blue is best in this format apparently. #mtg

Okay, I had a lot of fun so I did another one. No Boon of the Wish Giver meant the deck wasn't as strong. This one was a lot closer, but managed to get there.

I went for a third one and was struck down for my insolence. Only got three crystals this time and even fewer card draw! I think that's enough for this event lol
