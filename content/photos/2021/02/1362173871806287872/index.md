Posting publicly for the benefit of other Globe subscribers in Tandang Sora:. [@talk2GLOBE](https://twitter.com/talk2GLOBE/) seems like 36h (and counting) should be more than enough time to at least give us a estimated timeframe of when we can expect a fix. Is it possibly within the day? Week? Month?

Give us some idea so we can plan accordingly, especially for those who need this connection for work or school
