Managed to clear the #mtgarena Standard Open in just under an hour using [@urlichmtg](https://twitter.com/urlichmtg/) 's Monowhite Book list. Wasted a bunch of gems though, since I had a first run that was plagued by network issues on my end. Still, looking forward to day 2!

Unfortunately, day 2 didn't go quite as well. Finished day 2 at 5-2, just short of cash prizes! Such is life. Deck was a great choice though! BO3 decklist attached for reference.
