"I'll eat you!" #sketchdaily 111/365



I originally drew this on my tiny pad then scanned it so the text could be readable, but my handwriting was so obviously bad in the scan, I edited a new (and different) line into the text bubble digitally.

I'll attach the original anyway so you can see how terrible my handwriting was. I'd say it was because the pad was so small, but really my handwriting is terrible at any size!
