I just noticed that [@duolingo](https://twitter.com/duolingo/) web has great keyboard support, even in this "click to select words" mode. You can type to select words from the list, and enter/backspace work as you expect

(embarrassingly, the answer I have in the above screenshot is already wrong lol)

Unsurprisingly, the keyboard support doesn't work for Japanese mode
