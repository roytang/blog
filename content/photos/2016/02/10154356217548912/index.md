2016 Book #5: Triumph of the Darksword. I read the first two books of this trilogy back in high school, and I recently decided to get a used copy from Amazon (special thanks to the courier, you know who you are). I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to dive into the third book without having to re-read the first two, with a general recollection of the events from the first book still intact. I found it a bit heavy-handed with the prose, as the writers spend a couple of paragraphs in each scene for each character to ponder in self-doubt, fear or despair. I forget if that's something they did in the Dragonlance books as well. The plot of this book went in a direction that I wouldn't have been able to predict, but I guess the ending was satisfying enough. Time to read: Eight episodes of Battlestar Galactica
