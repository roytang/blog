So, after all that weighing of pros and cons of the different candidates, I might be the only idiot who accidentally voted #abstain4president. It wasn't any glitch in the machine or the ballot, just a glitch in the user. After standing in a hot queue for one hour, I took my ballot and sat down. I decided to skip the President slot first and just come back to it later since I was undecided, then filled in VP, Party-List and Senators. I decided to just skip the local candidates altogether and submitted my ballot and only realized my mistake when the scanner said UNDERVOTE for president. Oh well, I guess it was my destiny to abstain after all haha. I leave the rest to you guys!
