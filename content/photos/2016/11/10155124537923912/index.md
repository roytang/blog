Dear friends who support the president, paki-explain naman yung context ng quote below (yung nasa ibaba) please. 

Sa tingin ko, kung ibang abogado ang nagsabi nyan, ambilis nang dumating ng calls for disbarment

Edit: A friend below provides some context: "He was talking about the amount of proof needed to conduct an investigation which is probable cause Lang NOT proof beyond reasonable doubt."
