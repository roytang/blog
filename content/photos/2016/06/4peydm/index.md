#### Posted on r/Talesof: [[Tales of Hearts R] Can anyone tell me what's in that box over there? And maybe how to get to it? Sorc ring can't hit the crystal from here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Talesof/comments/4peydm/tales_of_hearts_r_can_anyone_tell_me_whats_in/)

[12:30] This is already on the second visit to Lignatore. I had already defeated the boss and there was the cutscene and everything, then I realized I didn't get this box and I probably won't be able to get it. I still have this save game that's right before the boss before I go to Mysticete, wondering if whatever is in there is worth re-loading to try to get it :p
