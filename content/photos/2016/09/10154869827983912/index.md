So, yesterday I found out my keyboard had been infested by ants (yes, we're terrible, we shouldn't be eating too much near the keyboard, etc). There's some pictures here if you want (warning: ANTS!)  I ended up having to take apart the keyboard (twice), rinse it, rinse the keycaps and the rubber contacts separately, then letting it dry overnight. I had already tried putting it back together last night, but it led to some weird problems like the R key rebooting the computer, or the 0 key randomly getting pressed continuously. I figured there was still moisture in the contacts so some additional dry time was needed  This is the second time I've tried to take apart and reassemble a keyboard due to an insect infestation (hindi natututo...), but last time the keyboard didn't work after I put it back together. This time seems more successful  It seems to work fine now, except that in the process I've lost one screw (it's somewhere under my desk, I don't have a flashlight to look for it with) and one rubber contact (I chose to sacrifice the Scroll Lock key). A second rubber contact was so worn down it was almost unresponsive - I moved it to the Pause/Break key. I have no other keys left to sacrifice so hopefully that's it.
