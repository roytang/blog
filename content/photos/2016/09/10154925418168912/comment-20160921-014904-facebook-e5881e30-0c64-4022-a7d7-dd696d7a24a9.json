Quoting a pilot friend on the same wall: \n \"If you subscribe to Flightradar24s emergency squawk notifications, \nyou'll know emergencies happen often but seldom hijacking. Kaya mabilis \nnalaman kung hijacking or hindi.   Squawk code for hijacking is 7500. That's what you dial in the transponder. 7600 for comms failure and 7700 for emergency.\" \n \" Definitely no simple explanation as to why he did it. That's 4 dials \nhe needs to turn to change the squawk code. Might cost the pilot's job.\"  \"4 dials plus twice pushing the \"ident\" button. Very very fishy.\"",
