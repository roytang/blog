Something to do: Every time you see an epal "there's no such thing as premature campaigning" ad from one of the devil's minions, share something about one of the lesser-known but better and vastly more deserving senatorial candidates.

Chel Diokno is chairman of the Free Legal Assistance Group, which Jose W. Diokno founded. It is the Philippines’ oldest and largest group of human rights lawyers.
