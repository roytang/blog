Into the Spider-Verse spoiler-free review

<br/></p><p>- this is a great animated comic book movie, it makes me happy<br/>- I may have been a bit overhyped by the early reviews, but it was very entertaining, funny and had brilliant presentation, melding the medium of movies with comic books in a way that has never been seen before<br/>- again, the presentation is fantastic, the animation is great and intentional and the funky alternate universe stuff is represented well<br/>- IDK if I would call it the best comic book movie of all time, or even the best Spider-Man movie of all time, but definitely one of the best animated movies of all time, for a comic book fan (highly specific lol)<br/>- in fact, much respect to the writers who dared to bring this story to life. imagine the challenge of pitching a story idea to Sony about not just one new Spider-man, but several alternate universe versions of them. It&rsquo;s not exactly comparable to a Disney movie plot after all, but they pulled it off<br/>- between this movie and the PS4 game, I&rsquo;m happy that Miles is making further inroads into the cultural zeitgeist<br/>- Miles appearance here reminds me of Hey Arnold&rsquo;s black friend lol<br/>- maybe I would have appreciated the movie a bit more if I was into hip-hop or such<br/>- comic book fans will be happy to know that this movie does *not* follow the actual Spider-Verse comic book arc along with its convoluted background of the inheritors. The plot and the opposition are much more straightforward<br/>- Will Mama like it? Well &hellip;like all animated movies, with enough viewings at home by my nieces/nephews, maybe.<br/>- This movie has the best post-credits scene of all time</p>
