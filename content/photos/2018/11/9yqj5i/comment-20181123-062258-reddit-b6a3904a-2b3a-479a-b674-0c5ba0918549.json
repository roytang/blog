  "text": "Yeah, I've been thinking about that, IDK really. The thing about draft is that no matter what you need some pool of gold to start with, and that's the limiting factor for a F2P-er. Now that I've done this draft thing, I'm focusing on ranked again for the remainder of the month as I'm still in gold, and I spent some gold already on the latest campaign, and I'll probably resume league again next month too. I guess I'll see how my gold and time situation works out in december.\n",
