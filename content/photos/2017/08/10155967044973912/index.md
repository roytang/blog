DEFENDERS spoiler-free review and episode guide:

(Okay, maybe a teensy little spoiler in that image - but I couldn't resist lol)

- this series moves forward each of the four protaganists
- you get to see most of the supporting cast come back and maybe even get a teeny bit of development in
- the plot is reasonably tight, i had a few minor nitpicks but now i can't even remember most of them
- Maybe it's just the fanboy in me, but I was really excited when they met each other for the first time
- Jessica Jones still the best character
- Iron Fist still the weakest point (see the image), but it's not as bad as it was in his own series. It helps that he's not surrounded by the weird Meachum family and has a better ensemble to work off of. I also really enjoyed how enthusiastic he was at getting a team together
- fight scenes are pretty good (at least better than in the Iron Fist series - also it's still weird that Daredevil fights a lot better than Iron Fist. He must have been a real slacker during that decade in Kun'Lun)
- I suspect you can come in cold without watching any of the previous series, they do bring up their backstories a lot
- I'm disappointed that there was no title drop

Episode guide:
