Shogun was the first novel I ever read outside of required school readings and it remains one of favorites to this day after many rereadings. It had it all - the age of exploration, religious conflict, languagr barriers, duty, honor, love, betrayal, war, sacrifice, samurai, ninjas, guns, cannons, etc and it still influences my thinking to this day
