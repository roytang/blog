This was [Committee GeekFight XVIII (October 2011): All Hallows' Geek!](https://www.facebook.com/events/864689103589822)

I'm at Quantum Cafe (Bagtikan corner Kamagong, Makati) w/ 2 others http://4sq.com/nmdVlx

We left the venue early thinking we didn't do well, but Jaime's friend Ian (Tabora) who was also at the event messaged us saying we actually finished 3rd and there was a prize we could have gotten had we stayed!
