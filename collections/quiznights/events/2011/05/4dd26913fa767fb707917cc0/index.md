The categories weren't particularly bad, it's just that we could have used Ryan to shore up the Royals category for example (he probably would have gotten us a 10 there, instead I think we got a 2). In fairness, we didn't have any category lower than a 2 but our highest category (aside from the Joker) was only a six. And our Joker (Games and Pastimes) was only an 8, which was terrible. Haha, super crushed. We're just glad we didn't come in last so that we retained a bit of dignity.
