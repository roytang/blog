This was our first ever Geekfight! This was [GeekFight Classic at GWEILO Makati: Nerd Machismo](https://www.facebook.com/events/828290667259036).

From the journal (slightly edited):

> We fit 9 people into Jaime's car and went to Makati, but as the rules stated they did not let us compete with more than 8 people in our team so we split into two groups AND we called in an additional member (Allan) to buff up the other team. Results first: our group ("Camote" - Liz, Paul, Josiah, Ryan and myself) finished 6th out of 8 teams, while the other group ("Klu" - Kaiser, Chry, Jaime, Bimbo and Allan) finished 4th.

> Now, my review: the food was ok, although the selection is slightly limited, but I had more choices here as they had more pizza and pasta and it seems the salpicao ("sloppy cow") Liz ordered was quite good. The quiz fee is more useful here as it earns us a free iced tea instead of just being plain registration money as compared to Murphy's. The questions were freaking hard as in obscure, even for categories I was fairly confident in (Pro Wrestling and Batman) I barely got any answers. It seems you have to be an ubergeek in those categories to get most of the answers. (I need to catch up to my backlog of Batman comics!). The crowd was more fun here compared to Murphys, and the answers are written on a small whiteboard and raised up and read out loud by the host for each question, so things can get quite loud with the trash talking and stuff. The event finished around 1am (kinda late). I had to withdraw 20k from the nearby ATM (for Brian's tuition) before we all hopped into Jaime's ride back to Megamall then I split a cab with Liz. All in all a good experience, but I'm not sure how willing the team members would be to come back, though I'm certainly willing to given the right categories.
