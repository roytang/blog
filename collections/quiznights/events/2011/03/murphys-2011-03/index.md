title: Quiz Night at Murphys
---

We attended quiz night at Murphy's.

From the journal:

> So we went to quiz night at Murphy's last night, there were only six of us on our intrepid team last night. We had a few misses, but generally the night went well, though as usual we did not place. We finished fourth out of eight teams, but almost an entire category away from third place. We got crushed in topics like History, Mountains (really, it's Geography in disguise!) and Reality Shows (it's Liz's fault for not being there!)
