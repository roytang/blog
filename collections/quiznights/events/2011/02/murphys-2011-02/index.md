title: Quiz Night at Murphy's

3rd: 75, 4th and 5th: 74, Team Camote: 73

This was the night of both the so-called messiest answer sheet in trivia night history and the drawing of the map of Guimaras.

From the journal:

> We got crushed in the early rounds, between a history category and a "geography" (places) category as usual we went like 3 and 1 in those rounds. We were at the bottom of the pile by the end of round 4. But in round 5 I was amused by the guest quiz where they would play a clip of a movie without sound and we would have to provide the name of the song being played at that point of the movie. I was so amused when the second one was Wayne's World and I almost blurted Bohemian Rhapsody out loud :p

> We caught up a bit in the last two rounds, getting a joker in the technology category (16pts); by the end of round 9 questions the round 8 scores were in and we were in third place. And we were having fun. Jaime was really excited everytime he came up with an answer to a question and one of our rounds our answer sheet had so many erasures (some due to our annoyance with Ryan's terrible handwriting) that we actually took a picture for posterity lol. The team was so excited that we were at third that I had to repeatedly tell them to be cool and forget about the earlier rounds and just get a perfect score in the last round haha.

> Unfortunately the last round wasn't too easy - it was Food and Drinks, and there were some foreign terms we had no idea about. This round has my only exclusive answer for the night that I recall - Gummi Bears, but aside from that we only got seven pts and nine points in round 9. It ended up as not good enough and we were 2pts away from placing in the end. So close! Still, one of our better nights and we had a lot of fun.
