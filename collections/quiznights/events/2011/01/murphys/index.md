title: Quiz Night at Murphys
---

We attended quiz night at Murphy's.

From the journal:

> Our quiz night affair at murphy's last night was kind of a disaster. There were a total of 16 of us planning to go so we had actually decided to split into two teams. Well they decided, I was kinda against it, because I didn't see the point. And I was kinda vindicated when our two teams finished second from last and tied for last! Our team was the one tied for last, but only because we poorly chose our joker. There was an engineering category that was misleading that we chose as our joker. It was so misleading the host offered to revert our joker and let us choose a succeeding round as joker, but the succeeding rounds were even worse for us, so we declined. Both teams actually answered the same number of questions correctly. So we were both terrible! Or the categories were really bad for us, as there were two "Geography" rounds and one US history round where both teams got seriously trashed. I think it was the first time we ever got only one point in a round. =/

> Well, actually the two teams thing turned out to be not so bad, as it was fun "competing" with another team we know. But it was kinda embarrassing to be falling in last place! I mentioned that we were the weakest among the "veteran" teams. We need to seriously supplant the geography weakness either by learning hard or recruiting new blood. :p
