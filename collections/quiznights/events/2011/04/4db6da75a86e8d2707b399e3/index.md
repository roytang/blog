title: Quiz Night at Murphy's
---

(@Murphy's Ground Flr Citiland III Bldg)

I just ousted [@zeayder](https://twitter.com/zeayder/) as the mayor of Murphy's Authentic Irish Pub on @foursquare! https://foursquare.com/v/murphys/4bbbfea5ed7776b032413f51

Last night we went to quiz night at Murphy's and we actually did reasonably well this time, really only getting crushed in some of our worst categories - places (geography) and I think Food and Drink. We had a well-placed joker, and probably lost something like 3-5 pts to inaccuracies and arguments among what would be the right answer, but those lost points would not have brought us to third place anyway as the leading teams were more than 10 pts away. Still, got to learn to minimize those sorts of things.

We finished 6th out of 8 teams.
