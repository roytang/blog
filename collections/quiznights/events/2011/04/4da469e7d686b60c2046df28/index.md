It was fun, but we're still losing :p 

The fun parts are those where the question clicks and we're able to answer it. But it's no fun (or maybe a bit depressing) playing those parts where we had no idea at all and just randomly put in blanks. Well, there's no quiz night at murphy's next week so maybe we have time to improve or become stronger.

At least I really did learn something new tonight - from context i always thought "moribund" meant some kind of sad, apparently it's "near death".
