We attended [30th at the 30th: 80s PopQuiz Invasion](https://www.facebook.com/events/1391288754240023/) at Toast Asian Kitchen & Tasting Room in Ayala Malls the 30th

Attendance: Me, Ryan, Chery.

We failed the ace question which was: `what year did Blade Runner take place?`

We finished 5th place/2nd from last with a mere 32pts! But we still got a GC!
