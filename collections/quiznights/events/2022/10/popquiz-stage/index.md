We skipped a couple of months of PopQuiz, but we're back!

Rounds were:

1. Drag Performers - 5pts
2. Concerts and Festival - 7pts
3. BTS - 20pts with Ace (good job Army teammates!)
4. Live Theater - 3pts
5. Fictional Competitions - 6pts
6. Video Games (audio round) - 8pts with powerup

We saved our powerup for the video games round because we didn't know it was an audio round which was much tougher.

The (very blurry because I was in a rush) board picture below implies we tied for 1st with 49pts, but actually after the tiebreaker (WHICH WAS ALSO TIED), the 3rd place team successfully contested their score and got bumped up to 50pts, so we actually finished tied for 2nd/3rd instead.

I missed an FF7 question in the audio round because I didn't believe it came out in 1997 (which is annoying because I had this exact same convo with another friend group in 2020!). We would have won if I got that, since it was a powered up round!
