We attended [PopQuiz x Eastwood City Food Park: Feast of Flavor Trivia Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1059077386368037/)!

Unfortunately, we did not do well, finishing 3rd out of 4th teams. This was mostly a function of the first place team having a successful ace/gamble while we failed ours; if the fortunes had been reversed, we would have won! So in that sense, it was kind of a close fight.

The event came with vouchers for food and drink, but the drink was coffee which was a bad idea and gave me trouble sleeping that night!

Round breakdown:

- Food in Pop Culture: 8pts
- Famous Chefs: 8pts
- Drinks in Pop Culture: 6pts x0 due to failed Gamble
- Fictional Food and Drinks: 9pts x2 due to Power-Up
- Cooking Competitions: 8pts
- Drinking Songs: 3pts
