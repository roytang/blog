After skipping October, we are back to trivia nights!

We attended [Ang P.A.N.G.E.T. na Trivia: A General Knowledge PopQuiz Trivia Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1477587296687185/)

Round breakdown:

- R1 (People): Jeopardy format - 7pts
- R2 (Arts/Entertainment): 3pts x2 for powerup
- R3 (Nature/Science): "Wheel of Fortune" format - 18pts/30 
- R4 (Geography): "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire" format (multiple choice) - 6pts, x0 for failed gamble
- R5 (Events/History): 8pts
- R6 (Things?!?): "Um, Actually" format - 12pts/20.
- Hail Mary: "Singing Bee" (give the next line of lyrics audio round) - 5pts

Our powerup was terrible and we failed the gamble! We finished a mere 5th place out of 10 teams.
