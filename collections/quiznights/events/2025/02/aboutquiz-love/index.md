title: 'AboutQuiz All About Love: A Quiz Night About Love Languages'
---

We attended an AboutQuiz quiz night at Saludo's! This is only their second quiz night after a post-pandemic comeback (we missed the first one). The theme for this one was about love languages.

[Event Page](https://www.facebook.com/events/1829797124422075)

- R1: Literature - 6pts
- R2: Geography (Before and After) - 5pts (x2 worst joker)
- R3: Brands - 8pts
- R4: Sex in Media - 7pts
- R5: Service - 7pts
- R6: Love - 5pts
- Pabibo: Elephants Medley - 2pts

We were in clear first place before the Pabibo round, so we only wagered enough to ensure we won, and we barely got there! Luckily the other teams missed their wagers so it didn't matter anyway!

A bit annoyed at the prize (pictured below), because we can't even use it for the next AboutQuiz in a month!
