We attended [POPQUIZ!: The 9th Anniversary Trivia Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/1078517644206166)

This was the last of their 9th anniversary events this July, so once again we got a bunch of giveaways.

Round breakdown:

- Game shows: Each question was based around a different game show format - 7pts, x2 for power-up.
- Tabletop games - 5pts.
- Theater: quickfire round where you had to identify if the given stage play is adapted from a book or movie; bonus points for naming the author/director- 10pts. This was easily our weakest category going in, so it's nice that it was a bit easier than expected.
- Heists - 6pts, x2 for successful ace. (It's been a while!)
- Whodunnits: quickfire round where you had to identify whether the character is an investigator, killer or victim; bonus points for identifying the show/movie - 12pts.
- Drawing round: Each round had a bonus point you can earn by making a drawing! We loved this round lol - 16pts.
- Hail mary: Identify the artist of the songs played and for 2 bonus points identify the common theme - 10pts.

This quiz was a lot of fun and we did a bit better here than last time, finishing in 3rd place a mere 3pts away from the top team.
