We attended [When You Quiz Upon A Star: A Quiz Night About Disney](https://www.facebook.com/events/1326938032108865/) at a new location, Gran Moshi Koshi at Vertis North.

Round breakdown:

- 🐭 Disney Channel: 6pts
- ⭐️ Disney Stars: 9pts
- 🛋️ Pixar: 9pts
- 🍎 Classics: 6pts
- 🎶 Disney Songs: 10pts
- 🦸‍♀️ Acquired IPs (Marvel, Star Wars etc.) : 5pts x2 for worst joker
- (Pabibo) Oscar-winning Disney or Pixar films: 2pts

We won! We got kind of lucky with the Pabibo round because we apparently misheard the score summaries or something. We only wagered 2 because we thought we were out of reach! If the 2nd place team had wagered 10pts and got it they would have beat us.
