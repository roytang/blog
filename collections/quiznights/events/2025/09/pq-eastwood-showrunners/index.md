We attended [PopQuiz x Eastwood City Food Park: TV Showrunners Trivia Night](https://www.facebook.com/events/675736345552811) at Eastwood Food Park.

Only two teams attended; they decided to give us two power-ups this time for fun.

Round breakdown:

- Shonda Rhimes - 6pts (I answered a [Residence](/2025/05/movies-tv-april-2025/#the-residence) question!)
- Darren Star - 4pts
- Chuck Lorre - 9pts x2 for power up
- Greg Berlanti - 7pts x2 for power up
- Seth McFarlane - 4pts
- Ryan Murphy - 4pts

We decided not to use the gamble ability this time, though we thought we were losing, so it was a pleasant surprise when we ended up actually winning by 6pts!

They also had a bingo card feature they introduced last month when we didn't attend any of their quizzes. We got some free stamps because we had some kind of leftover points from before the pandemic. We are up to 5 stamps already!
