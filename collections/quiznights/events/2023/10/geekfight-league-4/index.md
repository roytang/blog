We attended game 4 of the current Geekfight League, themed as "stories and tales".

1. Songs - 6pts (x2 for joker)
2. Edgar Allan Poe - 5pts
3. Memoirs / Biographies - 4pts
4. Jane Austen - 3pts
5. Theology - 3pts
6. Folklore - 3pts

The scores were very tight and we lost out on first place by a mere one point!! This was still good enough to keep us comfortably in the lead for the league though. Hoping we do better next time!
