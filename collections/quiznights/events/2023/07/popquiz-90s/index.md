This was a new venue for the 90s-themed PQ, and as 90s kids we were kind of obliged to go.

Rounds were:

1. 90s movies - 8pts x2 for power-up
2. 90s live action TV - 6pts
3. 90s animated TV/movies - 6pts
4. 90s events/personalities/games - 9pts
5. 90s opm - 7pts x2 for ace
6. 90s throwback - 6pts

No "Hail Mary" for us this time. (Honestly the venue food is kind of pricy, not sure I'd eat there again.)

We did relatively, ending up in 2nd place; the winning team had really good joker and ace rounds, so we wouldn't have won even if we had used our powers optimally.
