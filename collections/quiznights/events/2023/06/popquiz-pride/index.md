It's Pride month, so this event's rounds were all themed around the word "Pride"

Rounds were:

1. LGBTQ Pride - 2pts
2. Big and Small Cats in Media - 8pts
3. Schools - 5pts 
4. Sins - 6pts (x2 due to powerup)
5. Laundry and Soaps in Popular Media - 3pts
6. Classic Romance Literature - 8pts (x2 due to successful Ace!)
7. (Hail Mary) Drag Race Countries - 7pts

The "Hail Mary" mechanic returned and we were eligible, so round 7 above replaced our lowest scoring round.

We ended up tied for first place surprisingly, but the tiebreaker was a lipsync battle and we just conceded immediately since no one on our side was willing to do it. It's pride month, so second place is good enough for us straights!

We had soooo many questions where we already knew the correct answer but didn't get it due to doubts/internal debates and just flat out win the game. Later Liz said that God made it turn out that way so that the tiebreak round would happen. The host was very excited for it!

Looks like there'll be more quiz nights we can attend in July!
