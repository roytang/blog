1. Pokemon - 0pts
2. Wrestling - 1pt
3. Magic the Gathering - 7pts (x2 for joker!)
4. NBA - 5pts
5. Harry Potter - 4/5pts (not sure)
6. One Piece - 6pts

I originally didn't want to go to this one because the categories seemed quite hard, as evidenced by our terrible first two rounds, but somehow we managed to stage a comeback and to finish tied for first place at 31pts!
