We came back to GeekFight looking for revenge, but our (my) D&D and WWE knowledge fell short.

Rounds were:

1. Returns and Revivals - 8pts
2. Adapted Works - 16pts (Joker)
3. D&D - 4pts. Miserable, especially since if we were thinking straight we might have managed as high as a 7 here
4. Music - 3pts. Their selection of mashups and covers continues to confound us
5. Sequels and Spinoffs - 6pts
6. WWE - 2pts. Lol this went about as well as I expected.

At least we managed to tie for 2nd this time, within striking distance of the winning team, an improvement from [last time's 5th place](/collections/quiznights/geekfight-hobby-stadium).
