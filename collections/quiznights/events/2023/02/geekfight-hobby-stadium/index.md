title: Geekfight A Night At The Stadium
---

Geekfight returns to live quizzes after a 3 year hiatus! We attended the quiz at a new venue: Hobby Stadium.

Rounds were:

1. Pokemon - 7pts (We're not really into pokemon, so this is way above our expectations!)
2. NBA - 2pts (Our sports guy hasn't been in the country for a long while, so this is about par, maybe a bit below expectation)
3. Magic: The Gathering - 18pts (I confidently used our Joker here, knowing it would be easier than the Marvel round. Annoyed at the key art question that I missed!)
4. Marvel - 7pts (Two of my misses I would never have been able to answer, but I am again annoyed at myself for forgetting the name of the Hellfire Gala!)
5. Philippine Sports - 4pts (Had low expectations here as well)
6. Music round - 2pts (We flubbed this one badly, we just didn't know a lot of the tracks involved)

We only finished 5th out of 7 teams, although it was a pretty close fight. The winning team was only 6pts ahead of us!
