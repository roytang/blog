This was a difficult and low-scoring quiz night at one of the usual haunts. Despite a couple of terrible rounds and a poor choice of joker, we actually managed to finish 1pt away from tying for first! Scores for this game were super close, as is typical with difficult, wide-open nights.

Rounds were:

1. Hot Food - 2pts
2. Hot Places - 5pts (x2 for powerup)*
3. Hot People (reality/dating shows) - 4pts 
4. Heated Arguments (feuds and rivalries) - 2pts
5. Billboard Hot 100 (bad google translated song lyrics) - 7pts (x2 for successful Ace!)
6. Steamy Scenes - 5pts
7. (Hail Mary) OG Viva Hot Babes - 4pts

* We had 4 correct here on our tracker, but scorekeeper said he had 5, so we just went with that

The "Hail Mary" mechanic returned and we were eligible, so round 7 above replaced our lowest scoring round. (They would not agree to replace both 2s!)
