We attended [Lord Of The Rings Trivia Night in Poblacion](https://www.facebook.com/events/821038478341094) by Trivia Down Tuesdays. The venue was Cinko, Poblacion Makati.

From [the weeknotes](/2020/02/weeknotes-2020-02-02/):

> One event I did manage to go to was a Lord of the Rings themed quiz night last Friday. We had decided to try out this new quiz venue/organizer (new to us at least). And it turned out to be quite a different! There were a few written rounds, as in we write all our answers on a sheet of paper then exchange papers after the round. And after that, a couple of rounds with a physical component: teams had to race to raise their hands after the question was shown! And this was a right-minus-wrong section, with heavy penalties for wrong answers. So maybe our strategy of "just always raise our hands as fast as possible assuming we can get the answer" wasn't quite the best strategy we had hoped it would be. We didn't do too well (I think we finished at most 5th among 8 teams), but it was still pretty interesting.
