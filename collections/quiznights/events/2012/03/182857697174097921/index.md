I'm at Seventh High Superclub (Taguig City, Metro Mnila) http://4sq.com/GO88qP

This was [Committee GeekFight XXIV: Mixed Bag at Seventh High!](https://www.facebook.com/events/583577618412643/)

Apparently we split up into two teams named Camote GRATER and Camote LASER for some reason. GRATER finished 4th place, LASER probably died lol.
