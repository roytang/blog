I'm at Amici (San Juan, Metro Manila) http://4sq.com/LqzJXO

From the journal:

> Quiz night was ok, though we only placed fourth. I think in order to win we have to avoid dropping any categories at all, something that we failed at last night when we dropped the Nickelodeon category, scoring only 2 points in the entire round. T_T We jokered the Spider-Man round, but unfortunately I missed the question on which story arc he got the Venom symbiote from. =/ I answered Secret Wars II but it turns out it was the original Secret Wars. I was being stupid because I had one issue of each series when I was kid and it looks like I got them mixed up @_@. Secret Wars II was when the Beyonder came to Earth, dumbass!!! Argh, so annoying lol. I wanted to get a perfect score~
