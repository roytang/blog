I'm at Amici (San Juan, Metro Manila) http://4sq.com/KR1DtC

<time>[2012-06-08]</time> Last night's quiz night was fun. We actually did well and finished second, though the first place team was ahead of us by a whole six points. We got crushed during the first and second rounds, which were about soccer and george clooney (more crushed in the soccer round). Liz might be a bit disappointed since that's supposedly her area lol. Then we came back with perfect scores in rounds 3 (time travel) and 4 (youtube) and then jokering round 7 (asoiaf), although we didn't manage to perfect that one. The last round on disco music was kind of exciting, as the questions were mostly well-chosen. All in all a fun night.
