We attended [Seasons of Love: A Post-Valentine GeekFight!](https://www.facebook.com/events/1444332195801324)

From my logs:

> Geekfight last Wednesday at SF Bistro in Taguig. We had dinner first at Wrong Ramen. GF was more fun than I expected, and we finished 5th out of 15 teams. The venue was very small and crowded though.

Attendance: Me, Liz, Ory (!!), Ryan, Brian
