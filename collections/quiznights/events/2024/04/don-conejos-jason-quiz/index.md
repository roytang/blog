title: Jason Quiz Night @ Don Conejos
---

Jason, who used to host quiz nights at [Amici Greenhills](/locations/4cbea79719ceb1f7f2ba1ecd) invited us to a quiz night at a new place: Don Conejos near Greenhills.

The event was scheduled for 8pm and we were there on time, but it started late, almost 9:30pm I think. =/ We had a special guest from Sixsikan with us lol

Jason's quizzes always have "misleading category names" so you're never sure what to use your joker on. This night's categories were:

1. "Don't You Forget About Me" -> Musician real names - 6pts
2. "Noong Unang Panahon" -> History - 8pts
3. "Play Ball" -> Sports - 2pts (as expected, it was very hard for us)
4. "Signs of the Times" -> Logo quiz - 7pts
5. "Colors of the Wind" -> Colors - 8pts (x2 for joker - we thought it would be a Disney category)
6. "Streaming and chilling" -> Recent tv/streaming shows - 9pts
7. "Turning the pages" -> Childrens books adapted as movies - 9pts
8. "The Final Countdown" -> Songs with number in the title - 14pts (audio round with 1pt each for song title and artist. I had trouble remembering Spin Doctors, Joe Jackson and Color Me Badd!)

In the end we were able to eke out a victory by 1 pt. The other team that finished 2nd place were people I also recognized from [PopQuiz](/tags/popquiz/) events.

It was past 11pm by the time the event finished, which was annoying. The other team members had to leave early, but the resto owner chatted with us a bit and said they had another quiz night next Thursday with a different host and he was hoping we could attend and we took pictures and they gave us a "digital" GC as our prize.
