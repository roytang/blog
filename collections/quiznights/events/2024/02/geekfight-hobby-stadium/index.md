We attended Geekfight @ Hobby Stadium. Unfortunately, attendance was pretty low on this one, possibly due to the pre-long weekend traffic; the only other teams were a team of 2 and a team of 1, so it felt a bit like we were bullying them lol. We won this one.

1. Hobby Stadium - 4pts (ROUND LEADER)
2. MTG - 5pts x2 for joker (ROUND LEADER)
3. WWE - 2pts
4. Basketball - 4pts (ROUND LEADER)
5. Pokemon - 1pts (tied for ROUND LEADER)
6. Disney - 6pts (tied for ROUND LEADER)

In addition to the usual winner prize, they gave away themed prizes for teams that won each round. For the Hobby Stadium round (questions were related to collectibles and partnerships of the shop) we got Hobby Stadium shirts; for the MTG round I got three Set Boosters from random sets (they did not contain anything of particular value or interest); for the Basketball round we got some NBA trading cards (?). For Pokemon and Disney, we tied with one other team so we decided to take one prize each; the one we got was the Pokemon box with some Pokemon trading card game stuff, the Disney one was two Lorcana packs.
