title: Smartypants Quiz Night @ Tiny Bar
---

We attended a Sitcoms-themed quiz night under a new host, [Smarty Pants PH](https://www.instagram.com/smartypants_ph/) at Tiny Bar, Panay avenue.

The other teams apparently weren't used to quiz nights, so we kind of felt like bullies and there was a lot of good-natured trash-talking towards us. We won, but the final scores had the second place not as far away as everyone thought.

Categories breakdown:

- General sitcom trivia: 12pts
- Sitcom theme music: 16pts
- Pinoy Sitcoms: 5pts
- Chandler's punchlines: 10pts
- Sitcom sets: 10pts

They had a quiz format where they actually prepared 8 categories but we only played 5. After the quiz, the crowd wanted more so they ran 2 more categories, no points tracked.
