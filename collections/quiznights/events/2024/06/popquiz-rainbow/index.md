We attended Pop Quiz again at Int/Ext, this time with the Rainbow theme for Pride Month. They were away for a couple of months because the host had a health scare, but apparently we are back in business.

Attendance: Me, C, S, Kim, Dan.

This quiz night's rounds were rainbow-themed, with one color per round (skipping Indigo). They're mostly general knowledge questions except each themed around a color, so choosing a power-up round was a crapshoot. Here's how we did: 

1. Red - 7pts
2. Orange - 9pts x2 for successful ace. We got the ace answer at the very last question, so that was a tense round.
3. Yellow - 6pts. Sample question for this round is in one of the images below, which I saved to show my [Arkham Horror](/2023/04/arkham-horror-lcg/) friends as that's the only reason I was able to answer it!
4. Green - 7pts x2 for power-up. Chosen at random because I like the color green.
5. Blue - 5pts. C wanted to choose this one as power-up which would have been the worst option.
6. Violet - 6pts.
7. (Hail Mary) Identify 10 different pride flags - 5pts. 

In the end we managed to win with a comfortable lead, so it's a good return to form.
