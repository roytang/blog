title: Geekfight League Final
---

This was the final game of the Geekfight League "season 1", with a "Star Trek" theme. 

1. Kelvin Timeline - 3pts (x2 for Joker)
2. George Takei - 3pts
3. Music - 3pts
4. Bridge Crew - 4pts
5. Science - 4pts
6. Why is Star Trek - 6pts

We did so terribly. We actually finished 4th out of 5 teams! However, our league points lead was insurmountable, so we still finished first in the league! Our prize for this was a replice of Stormbringer, Thor's axe from Endgame, which I had to bring home, earning me a funny look from a taxi driver!
