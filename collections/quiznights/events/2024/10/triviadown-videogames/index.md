Trivia team attended a quiz night hosted by Trivia Down @ Skyline Sports Bar in Century City Mall in Makati. [Last May attended one of their quizzes with a different group](/collections/quiznights/225-bistro-90s-quiz). This was the trivia team's first foray with this host since before the pandemic.

I usually dislike going all the way out to Makati, but we liked the theme for this one (videogames) and I was telling the group that pre-pandemic we used to go out to Makati quiz nights all the time, so maybe this was also a bit of an attempt to capture some of that energy.

The venue was ok, food was a bit pricey, but the nice thing is that they had free play arcade machines. I played a bit while waiting for the team, and we played some more after the quiz. I had trouble with the SF2 machine, could not win a match! Execution is so hard here, and I think the CPU difficulty was ramped up!

As for the quiz itself, only 3 teams attended (plus a non-serious house team). Two of our friends were going to join us but they knew the one other guy who was originally planning to go solo and we just agreed to split into two teams of 3 and 4 each. 

Trivia Down's format is something like 9 rounds of varying number of questions, with some kind of gimmick in the last round. The host here is the same one as when I attended at 225 Bistro. Here's our round-by-round breakdown:

- Videogame history: 5 pts
- Videogame Worlds (Anagrams): 5pts
- Logos: 4pts
- Cover art: 5pts
- Pixelated characters: 5pts
- Gaming Terms: 8pts
- Videogame soundtracks: 4pts
- Videogame franchises/release orders: 3pts
- Videogame characters (Charades): 7pts

Final standings:

- Neilat V2: 50 pts
- Camote: 46 pts
- 3HP: 46 pts

The scores were relatively close all around throughout the quiz, but at the end the other team (the one we didn't know) edged ahead of us and we ended up tied for 2nd place (or last place?)
