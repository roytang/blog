title: 'Don Conejos Quiz Night #2'
---

We attended our second quiz night at Don Conejos ([the first time was last month](/collections/quiznights/don-conejos-jason-quiz)). They actually have these quiz nights weekly I think, but so far we have only attended when Jason is hosting. Some other person hosts on the other nights and so far we haven't felt up to trying him out.

The last time we attended a quiz night here it finished so late. Jason promised that this time we would start no later than 9pm (advertised time was 8pm), but we ended up having to wait for some other teams and still started close to 9pm. Sigh. 

This night's categories and our scores were:

1. Adaptations - 9pts
2. "The Eyes Have It" - guess the celebrity based on a picture of their eyes - 7pts
3. "It's A Secret" - secret identities - 9pts. I had some good pulls here, but we missed a BNHA question which we were discussing until round 4!
4. "Hurray for Hollywood" - Oscars - 7pts (x2 for joker)
5. "Elementary My Dear Watson" - real and fictional elements - 10pts. We got a perfect score here despite vigorously discussing BNHA secret identities all the while!
6. "Hallelujah" - Halle Berry - 6 pts
7. "That's No Moon" - Star Wars - 7pts. Jason is a big Star Wars fan, so its unsurprising he had this round right after Star Wars day. I missed a couple of ones I should have gotten!
8. "What's In A Name" - audio round: songs with names in the title - 12pts (out of 20). We knew most of the songs but had trouble naming many of the artists!

In the end we finished second, 3 pts behind first place. We would have gotten there with a better choice of joker!
