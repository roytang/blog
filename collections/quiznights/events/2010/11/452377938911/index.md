title: Quiz Night at Murphy's
---

Team Camote (4th place). 81/110pts. Top 3 teams were at 96, 82, 82.

From the journal:

> So, we actually almost won quiz night at murphy's last tuesday. Well more of we almost made second/third place, only missing it by one point. So close! We used our joker correctly, and we were leading for halfway through until we got crushed in the second half by novels and geography categories (geography - our arch nemesis!) There were a couple of questions we could have gotten had my teammates listened to me, but that's fine; after all I also made a few mistakes in the past instances.
