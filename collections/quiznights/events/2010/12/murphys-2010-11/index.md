title: Quiz Night at Murphy's
---

So we went to Murphy's quiz night last night, the last one for this year. Unfortunately we had like twelve people on our team and they reserved for us a table near the back that could barely seat ten, so we were scrunched up together like sardines most of the time. And we didn't even do that well in the trivia part either! Middle of the pack mostly, but once again we have a lot of weaknesses in terms of geography and literature. And the weapons questions were surprisingly hard, Jaime did not get most of them as I expected. Oh well, at least we were still ahead of the curve somewhat. Still, slightly disappointing.

Some categories:

- Internet memes: we got 9 out of 10.
- Food and Drink: This was one of our lowest categories.
- People and Places: This was one of our lowest categories.
