title: Quiz Night at Murphy's
---

This was my first ever quiz night! But I think the second one for Team Camote, I did not join them the first time.

From chat logs:

- <chry>	we did not win but we made progress
- <chry>	5th place kami vs 6th before

Attendance: karlo, ryan, chry, josiah, bimbo, roy, paul

From the journal:

> I went with the camote crew (literally, the people who hang out in the camote trivia channel) to Quiz Night at Murphy's, an Irish Pub in Makati. The experience was nicer than I expected (I don't like bars), and really brought out my competitive side. The questions were hard, no way would I have been able to handle them myself, it's really a team game. We did well during the first few categories, even getting to second place at one point, but then started getting crushed in the later categories (Geography and Sports Heroes were our particular weaknesses). We eventually ended up fifth among the teams, half a point behind the fourth placer team, who coincidentally included a guy I knew from playing Magic. Regarding the venue, the food was overpriced (I commented that they were five-star hotel prices) though satisfying, and there were cute waitresses. The clientele of the Irish Pub seemed to be geared towards foreigners though there were a lot of other Pinoys participating in the Quiz Night with us. Our team will have revenge! But not too soon, after all the food was expensive.
