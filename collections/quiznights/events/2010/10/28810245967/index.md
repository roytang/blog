From the journal:

> There were a lot more of us this Time, eleven team members compared to seven the last time. The eleventh team member actually couldn't make it and we literally found another guy off the street to help us (well more of he was an exazeus guy we accidentally ran into). 
> 
> It was all good anyway. We went for the quizzes hard, hoping to place this time but in the end we turned out doing worse than last time. We made a poor choice of joker category and had some bad coordination and guessing. Plus the questions were like a lot tougher this time for some reason. So yeah, we need to improve. But everybody had fun et cetera so we went home mostly content. 

Quiz night was fun with more people. But we need to actually perform better! :D

We finished 7th place. Categories were:

- beer logos
- thesaurus
- weapons: 9pts thanks to Jaime
- religion (our lowest category)
- science
- artworks
- general info
- entertainment
- geography
- corporate
