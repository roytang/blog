I believe this is from an issue in the IDW Transformers Universe, not sure what issue.

The original quote:

> "If one meets a powerful person--Rupert Murdoch, perhaps, or Joe Stalin or Hitler--one can ask five questions: what power do you have; where did you get it; in whose interests do you exercise it; to whom are you accountable; and, how can we get rid of you? Anyone who cannot answer the last of those questions does not live in a democratic system." - British politician Tony Benn
