All New X-Men Annual #1 - floating timeline much?

Bendis is probably just waiting for someone to call him out on this on Tumblr or Twitter...

On another note, damn Sorrentino's work on the two X-Men annuals has been great. I really enjoyed his Green Arrow work and I'm hoping to see a lot more Marvel work from him
