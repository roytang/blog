  "text": "I suspect a higher percentage than if you restrict it to those that won&#x27;t necessarily care enough to make it count.    Mind you, motivation doesn&#x27;t need to mean wanting to continue getting an education.  I remember telling some graduating students in high school that if they already knew what they wanted to do in life and knew how to get there, college education was likelier to be detrimental than helpful.  Sometimes you just need to know enough, and anything more is a waste of time and effort.  Knowing when its enough is the trick to education, and motivation unlocks it.",
