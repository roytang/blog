  "text": "I've\n met people who were born in the Philippines and have 2 Filipino parents\n - and they hate the country with a passion. On the other hand I have \nfriends who are neither Filipino by blood or by place of birth and they \nwork harder than I do to make the country better.  To me, being \nFilipino means caring deeply enough about the country and it's people to\n work towards its betterment no matter where you are.",
