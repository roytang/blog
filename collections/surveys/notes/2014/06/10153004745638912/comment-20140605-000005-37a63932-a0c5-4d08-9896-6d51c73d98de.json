  "text": "In the culinary realm, a vegetable was something a traditional western trained chef would put into a salad (i.e not fruit salad or asian mango salad) That&#x27;s why tomatoes are sometimes considered vegetables.    Biology-wise, vegetables have no exact definition. I put them as root crops or certain vine-growing that crawl along the soil, with the likes of cabbages, carrots, and beetroots being the root crop, and pumpkin (pumpkins carry seeds so are technically fruit) being the vine variation. Since potatoes are a root crop and can be found in traditional salads, I consider them veggies too.",
