title: 'David Dayen: America has abandoned the rule of law'

*[Roy] So applicable in our country as well. Failure of justice system leads to mob justice *

---

1/ The reason there's a concern about disproportionate responses in the last month of sexual misconduct revelations is that we've utterly abandoned the rule of law in America.

---

2/ A fair number of the cases reported in the media are crimes, which should be punishable by prison terms. None of that has happened.

---

3/ Bill Cosby, 40 years of rape, not in jail. Kevin Spacey, decades of assault, not in jail. Harvey Weinstein, decades of rape, maybe a case will emerge, maybe not.

---

4/ So the only response available in the absence of law enforcement is a kind of driving from the public square. We've left the profession of adjudicating crimes to the crowd.

---

5/ This is a direct consequence of the failure of accountability for a connected class of elites who commit wrongdoing over decades. Nobody has any recourse.

---

6/ And so crimes of varying degrees get leveled off into the same response, resign, go away, away. We don't have a justice system anymore, and this is the result.

---

7/ So yes, when I bang on about the failure of accountability, I may be talking about one type of fraud. But there's a toxicity to that failure, a rot at the heart of our society.

---

8/ what we should be deeply enraged about is that no mechanism exists to punish misconduct swiftly and dispassionately for an entire slice of the population. That's how you lose a country.

---

9/ I am less troubled by the consequences of rage at a broken system protecting predators of various degrees, than the consequences *of that broken system*, which goes well beyond sexual misconduct.

---

10/ We are wildly disproportionately punitive toward one class of society & not another in dozens of contexts. How do you expect people to react to that when the culture turns?
