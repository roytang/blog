title: Even Aragorn suffers Dunning Kruger 
---

There’s a subtle detail in the LOTR books that didn’t quite translate to the movie, and while I understand why, it’s a moment that sticks in my mind and I think about a lot—

---

It comes when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are chasing the Uruk-hai that have captured Merry & Pippin.

---

In their desperation to rescue their friends before it is too late, the trio—“los tres melons”, as I like to call them—push themselves harder than ever before, not even stopping to eat and sleep.

[gif of Aragorn saying "Let's hunt some orc."]

---

Each of them remarks that they feel as if an unseen force holds them back—like that nightmare-feeling of trying to run through quicksand. 



“There is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us.”

---

They presume, and the movie runs with this interpretation as well, that it is Saruman working some magic to hold them back.

But I don’t think that’s it.



The three bemoan not being able to move faster to overtake their quarry;

But when they meet Eomer and his company, he at first doesn’t believe that they’ve come the distance they claim.

“On foot! Strider is too poor a name... Wingfoot I name you. This deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall,” is Éomer’s response. 

He informs the group they’ve traveled 45 leagues in less than 4 days. It should not be possible.

---

In short:

there was no mysterious force slowing them down.

On the contrary, determination and love drove them to run with superhuman speed, despite lack of food and sleep.



What they felt holding them back was no malignant magical power—it’s called BEING TIRED.

---

It’s not remarked on again, but I LOVE this bit because so true.

---

How often have I seen people do this—push ourselves past the limit of human endurance, beat ourselves up for not being able to do MORE, when we’re already doing the impossible.

---

This idea is echoed in Aragorn’s journey toward becoming a leader.



One of the best themes in the saga is Aragorn doubting his fitness to take his rightful place on the throne of Gondor; he is afraid that the “weakness of Isildur” is in his blood also.

He’s afraid to fail.

---

After Boromir dies and the fellowship is split, Aragorn expresses the belief that all his decisions since taking over as leader from Gandalf have turned it to be bad; he blames himself for all his friends’ bad fortune, even when they bring it on themselves.

---

Aragorn feels himself to be cursed—the curse of his bloodline—and is so certain all his decisions are doomed to end in disaster, it nearly paralyzes him on several occasions.



Not only nearly. He keeps trying to do the best he can, anyway.

---

“How shall a man judge what to do in such times?” asks Éomer; and Aragorn replies, in one of my favorite lines from the book:

“As he has ever judged...”

---

”Good and ill have not changed since yesteryear, nor are they one thing among elves and dwarves and another among men. It is a man’s part to discern them, as much in the golden wood as in his own house.”

---

And so he does. 

Even when all his choices seem to be going wrong, all his hopes seem doomed to failure, his friends die around him—Aragorn never despairs. He keeps doing what seems to be the right thing, as best he can tell.



And, of course, (spoiler alert) they win, in the end.

---

We find out in the epilogue that Aragorn’s reign in Gondor is the new Golden Age in that part of the world.



Would any of this have been possible—would Sauron have been destroyed—if Aragorn son of Arathorn had given in to his self-doubt and remained in obscurity?

---

Who knows. After all, Gandalf would remind us, “even the very wise cannot see all ends.”

---

I guess my takeaway from all this is: don’t beat yourself up or give in to despair when it seems like you can’t do anything right. You can’t see everything that is happening or will happen; you might, without realizing it, turn out to be doing the impossible.

---

Sorry if I got corny toward the end there.

Here’s another shot of Aragorn being gorgeous to wrap up.

(I want to clarify, I’m not hating on the LotR movies. They aren’t perfect, but they do a LOT of things really well. There just isn’t time for every nuance and detail in the books to make it onscreen. 

Film and page are very different mediums, and do different things.)

---

WOW I did not expect this to blow up as much as it did. I’m glad my late-night musings brought enjoyment to so many of you. 

I’m going to mute this thread, now, for the sake of my mentions.
