Every year on Purim, I read the Book of Esther, and new things jump out at me, resonate, feel significant. This year, I could not stop thinking about one particular bit, so I want to take a minute to share it with you.
The scene: the Jews of Persia are under a death edict. Esther is incognito in the Palace. No one knows she's Jewish, so in theory, she's safe. Mordechai reaches out to her: "You need to do something." And Esther says "I can't, if I go to the king unsummoned I will literally die."
There is a law that if anyone comes unsummoned to the king, they forfeit their life. And Esther hasn't been summoned for over a month. She has very good reason to think that she would be putting her life on the line if she even tries to intercede for the Jews. It's super risky.
And Mordechai says: "Don't think that just because you're safe, you're safe. If you stay silent, salvation will come from another avenue, and you'll end up ruined too. And who knows--maybe it was for this very moment that you became queen?"
And Esther says "Yes. You're right. I'm going in, and if I die trying, so be it."

And that, right there, that's the bit I can't stop thinking about.
The idea that, in a time of crisis, when you think you're safe, but people around you are in peril-that's the moment, more than any, when you must risk your own safety & comfort, to stand up for those in trouble.

That you don't get to say "well, I'm ok, no need to get involved."
Yes, standing up for others may bring risk and harm upon you. Yes, it may make your own life harder. But if you're privileged enough to not be the at-risk population, you have a responsibility to utilize your privilege, stand up for those who need it.

How can you not?
Because if we don't stand up, speak up, fight for the marginalized people around us--maybe we won't be physically destroyed, but how will we be able to live with ourselves?

Our physical bodies may escaped unscathed, but what kind of people would we become, if we stood idly by?
So that's the lesson of Esther I'm taking away this year, a lesson for these times, when the world is bleak, and safety sometimes seems like an illusion.

Never take your privilege for granted. Always use it to stand up for people around you, even when it might cost you.
Because that's how we'll get through this. By standing up for people, even when we feel safe ourselves. By supporting others. By having each others' backs, no matter what, even when it puts us at risk.

Friends, let's be like Esther this year.

And happy Purim to you all!
