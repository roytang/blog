title: Google antitrust filing
---

RT ðŸ”’ (with permission):



"Ok so, I just read through all 173 pages of the unredacted Google antitrust filing and I have to say that either Google is screwed or society is screwed, we'll find out which.



Unordered list of fun things I learned:"

"google has a secret deal with facebook called "Jedi Blue" that they knew was so illegal that it has a whole section describing how they'll cover for each other if anyone finds out

- google appears to have a team called gTrade that is wholly dedicated to ad market manipulation"

---

"- Google had a plan called "Project NERA" to turn the web into a walled garden they called "Not Owned But Operated". A core component of this was the forced logins to the chrome browser you've probably experienced (surprise!)"

---

"- Google is willing to do almost everything to prevent people from circumventing their ad exchanges

- This is what AMP is about

- Google habitually insider trades on their ad exchanges in every way you can think of and every way you can't. Too many ways to list here."

---

"- The exchanges are also rigged so that google wins on bids where they aren't the highest bidder.

- A large amount of people inside google are aware of all of this

- If Google ever tells you some change will increase your ad yield, run. In fact anything they tell you is a lie"

---

"- Google has worked with Facebook and Microsoft to discourage them from increasing user privacy, lamenting occasions where they prioritized their reputation over their collective business interest"
