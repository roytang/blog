title: You are allowed to leave an uncomfortable situation
---

I want to tell you a story about how my mum taught me that I’m allowed to leave an uncomfortable situation.

---

I was maybe 7, I think it was my first sleepover at someone else’s house. I don’t remember the girl’s name. But before I left Mum told me that if I was uncomfortable at any point, for any reason, even if it was in the middle of the night, I could call her.

---

She was very clear. She said even if her parents have gone to bed I want you to knock on their bedroom door and ask to use the phone. I could call her even if it was late. And if her parents didn’t answer the door to just go find the phone and call her anyway.

---

She said it doesn’t matter what time it is, you won’t be in trouble and I’ll come get you. 



I think I was being teased about something. It definitely wasn’t just I can’t sleep, there was something social going on. But that’s what I did.

---

The girl’s mom tried to discourage me. She said it was late, I said my mum didn’t care. She said I could sleep on the couch. I said I wanted to go home. She said I was upsetting her daughter, I said she was mean to me.

---

I remember holding the phone and my mum answered. I said “hi Mum.” She said “you want me to come get you?” I said “yes please.” She said “ask her Mum to help you pack up your things and get your coat on. I’ll be right there.”

---

And my mum showed up on her doorstep in pajama pants and a coat. The girl’s mum kept apologizing for me calling, my mum put up a hand and said “don’t apologize for my daughter. I want her to know she’s allowed to leave and I’ll be there for her at any time.”

---

I remember the little crowd of sleepover girls huddled in the far doorway that led to the bedrooms, watching all of this confused and silent. And I remember that mom apologizing. She didn’t seem to know what to say after my mum asked her to stop.

---

I had more incidents like that as I grew up. My mum did a lot around boundaries with me. I remember her marching me down the street to another girl’s house to ask for an apology in front of her parents.

---

I remember her telling 3 friends to sit in the front room with their bags packed while they waited for their parents to come get them, after I had told them all to “get out of my house” for teasing me and bullying me.

---

I remember her coaching me through a speech on how to resign and leave from a hostile work environment when I was in the middle of nowhere at a camp for the summer, and she offered money to get a cab to pick me and my friends up.

---

I can’t say I’ve always followed my gut on boundaries and discomfort. I can’t say I’ve never swallowed it in order to make others comfortable. But I can say what she taught me was important. It was and still is radical.

---

It’s radical to have boundaries. And to exercise them. Three things I think were really really important in what she did: 

1. She always explicitly said “you can leave if you want to.”

2. She never questioned why, or whether I was overreacting.

3. She showed up.

---

But I think a lot about the girl’s mum apologizing and how... that’s the norm, actually. What my mum taught me was radical, what that girl’s mum was teaching was the norm. “Just deal with it, don’t trouble anyone, go back to sleep, it’ll be over soon, don’t ruin it.”

---

And I still get that message from a lot of places. But my mum taught me that I’m allowed to leave.



I see what a privilege that is as an adult. For some people, for some situations, there is no way out. But sometimes, also, we don’t leave because we think we’re not allowed.

---

So, just in case no one ever told you (or you need a reminder): YOU ARE ALLOWED TO LEAVE.



You can leave a date, a party, a job, a meeting, a commitment. You are allowed. If you’re worried about keeping your word remember that your boundaries are also your word, your integrity.

---

I wanted to tell this story because the message to stay to make others comfortable is so pervasive, that without actively teaching me that I’m allowed to leave, that’s what I would’ve absorbed.

---

Hell, I absorbed a lot of it anyway. As an adult, at that camp job, I remember her on the phone saying “what do you want to do?” And not knowing, until she said “do you want to leave?” And I said “can I?” She said “You can always leave. What do you need so you can leave?”

---

So, if you’re a person like me, who was taught that you’re allowed to leave, keep an eye out for those who weren’t. They may need the reminder. They may need to hear that it’s okay. They may need help. And keep telling yourself that you are allowed. You’re allowed to leave. debugger eval code:37:9

---

Wow this is really taking off! Before it goes too far I wanted to say: I’m seeing this being gendered and while I am a woman and my mother is a woman there’s no gender on this message. I understand the impulse to teach your daughters this but please teach all children.

---

When you know that you are allowed to leave, when you exercise that boundary, the idea that others are allowed to leave also comes up. Boys stay in uncomfortable situations to fit in as well, they also deserve this lesson.

---

Trans, non binary and gender non conforming folks often shrink themselves for the comfort of those around them. They deserve this lesson too. Everyone is allowed to leave. No one is obliged to be uncomfortable for others’ comfort or enjoyment. 

---

PS: getting some messages from folks about toughening up and how you have to live through discomfort “sometimes” and a lot of those people are men. Y’all might want to look into that. Talk about it or something. Journal,I dunno. Seems like there’s something deeper going on there.

---

I mean, personally as a woman with a functioning uterus I’ve learned to live with discomfort a minimum of 25% of the time. Factor in ableist, white supremacist, capitalist patriarchy and it’s basically any time I’m not at home, so, I’m covered. 

---

Thoughts a few days later:

---

On today, the third day of my life with this thread, I believe I have uncovered the main point of contention for the whattaboutters. 



It’s the word “uncomfortable”.



Shall we dig into that a bit?

---

I chose the word “uncomfortable” very deliberately. I could have used “harmful” or “unsafe” or “destructive” or “abusive”. But I didn’t. I used “uncomfortable”. 



Sometimes I misspeak and I use words where better words should be. But this was not one of those times. I meant it.

---

Let’s skip right over the part where there are clear power dynamics at play in people feeling the need to question my choice of words, as if I’m not a writer, or someone who works with words, and therefore has an intentional relationship to them. Let’s stick a pin in that.

---

Instead let’s focus in on why the word “uncomfortable” makes people so uncomfortable. And to understand that you need to know why I chose “uncomfortable” over any of the other words I listed. 



I chose it because it’s personal.

---

All of those other words have outside expectations of understanding on them. “Abusive” is often defined by outsiders. “Harmful” is defined by observers. “Unsafe” means that anyone in that situation would feel the same. “Destructive” means others can see it too.

---

But “uncomfortable” is personal. It’s yours. It’s all you. You can be uncomfortable in a space where everyone else is having a blast. You can be uncomfortable for any reason at all.

---

Interestingly no one has asked me why I chose “uncomfortable” instead they’ve asked me to define it within specific boundaries that they set. The answer is more fluid. The answer is “it depends” and it depends on the person, in that moment, and what they feel.

---

There are more reasons I chose “uncomfortable”. One of them is because within the word “uncomfortable” is the opposite - “comfortable”.

---

And for a lot of people in this world the idea of being comfortable in any space, let alone some spaces, is mind-blowing.

---

The third reason, is that it’s a code word. Specifically, it’s a feminized code word. Or more accurately, it’s a non-cis-het-able-white-man code word.

---

Just like in this tweet, the word “asshole” is a code word. In the boundaries thread, the word “uncomfortable” is a code word.

---

It’s a code word because not only are we, as a society, trained to downplay the discomfort of others to the point where we expect them to tough their way through it, but we do it to ourselves.

---

I bet every one of you can think of a situation that you would not feel justified in labeling “abusive”, “unsafe, “destructive” or “harmful”, but if I asked you if it was “uncomfortable”, you’d say “well... maybe I guess. A little. Yeah.”

---

And that’s why. That “maybe”, right there. That’s the reason for the word “uncomfortable”. That gray space, that uncertainty, that definition that only belongs to you.

---

So in short, some people are uncomfortable with the word “uncomfortable” because it’s a word that you define for yourself and that they have no control over.

---

And some people seem to think that they need to construct uncomfortable situations for others to live through for the “toughening up” of themselves, their children, society at large. 



Let me be clear: this is fucked up.

---

Just to avoid any future potential confusion, when I say “this is fucked up”, I mean exactly that. Because that’s what I said.

---

For those who still didn’t find a satisfactory answer in this about my use of the word “uncomfortable” and want to continue to use examples like “homework” as “uncomfortable”, the word you’re looking for is: “challenging”.

---

For those who continue to use examples of new activities or experiences or vegetables as potentially “uncomfortable”, the word you’re looking for is “unfamiliar”. 



Though in the case of vegetables it might be gas.

---

Thoughts a few more days later:

---

Me: “You are allowed to leave.”



Literally thousands of people: “I wish I knew this when I was younger, it would’ve saved me so much pain.”



Dudebros: “Hey whoa, hey now, hey.”



Amazing that so many dudes advocating “building social skills” can’t read a fucking room.

---

Endless lines of dudes talking about getting tough and life is hard and conflict resolution skills and my dudes?



You. Have. No. Idea. How. Much. Work. We. Do. To. Avoid. Resolve. Clean up. And. Survive. Your. Shit.

---

All those bar fights you’re talking about? Yeah we’ve been there. We’ve flagged down the bouncer to stop you from hurting someone. We’re the servers who slide you a water when you’ve had too many. We’ve been the person you trampled on to get a swing in.

---

We learn your tone, your posture, your facial expressions, your habits, your triggers. We do things to keep you happy so you don’t start “conflict” and we apologize and smooth it over for you when you do.

---

And you still. Still. In spite of all our work and all our words and all our gut wrenching, heartbreaking, personal, painful stories, refuse to take a look around before you start swinging.

---

It’s been 5 days and I have been inundated with thousands of stories. Stories of people who are in pain, who have survived pain, who are in mourning for the children that they were and could have been. Thousands of them.

---

And yet I still have self-important asshats saying that I’m wrong because we need to build character. We need to build skills. We have to stand up for ourselves. 



We have so much character. We have skills you are incapable of seeing. We are standing up for ourselves.

---

We aren’t bending to your rules anymore. You don’t make the rules anymore. 



Get. On. Our. Level.



Read a fucking room. You might learn something.
