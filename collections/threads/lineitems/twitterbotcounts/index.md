The primary reason twitter works so hard to protect racists and meninists and such is cuz their bot counts are staggering,

---

It reminds me of when I worked in a warehouse  consolidating orders for a sales team.

---

When I was hired, they did not know I was autistic, and there were two teams -- basically the "regular people" and "business" teams

---

The regular people team just sold to the public and shipped orders, whereas the business team produced "quotes" for salesmen

---

And the business team worked very hard to inflate their sales to "look busy," because the quotes were dollar-based

---

So they could tell their business sales manager how many quotes they were pursuing at any given moment.

---

Since the business salespeople were judged on productivity, a big quote book created the illusion of progress even as sales didn't exist.

---

I was brought in to collect product and store it with quote information attached, and to follow up to make sure orders were shipped

---

Part of my job description was to maintain the correct handling of this log of quotes, making sure they were shipped or deleted

---

My job was to review the quotes each day, collect new ones, and then contact the company to let them know the order was ready.

---

The way the system was set up was for credit card info to accompany quotes, so that when t came time to ship they could charge the cards.

---

You'll be shocked to know that the credit card data was very rarely present.  I know, you're shocked.

---

So part of my job was also to contact the customer,  collect billing data and bill customers appropriately

---

Now, I'm autistic.  And anyone autistic probably knows where this story is going already

---

as do neurotypcial people who know just how savagely predatory salesmen are

---

So on my first day of reviewing the quote log, the first thing I did was call -every single person- on it to confirm them

---

I called every single company and spoke to every single person and confirmed we could or could not ship the order.

---

Now, nobody in the company's history had ever done this.  Ever.  It was usually a "floating" figure.

---

There were so many thousands of orders that nobody they'd hired previous had done anything but "puttin' out fires"

---

But, as an autistic person, I undertook the challenge.  I spent the first week in my office alone counting orders and making call after call

---

When I started working the log, the total quote value was 3,666,027.  I remember that number.

---

You'll be shocked to know that for every valid order, there were roughly 50-100 phony ones.

---

Disconnected phone lines (that will be important later) played a large role.

---

For the bad phone line ones,  I would use the internet to look up info on the company doing the ordering and contact the person whose name--

---

-- was listed on the order, and corrected the phone info and address etc for every order.

---

And -- again, shocking, I know -- most of the companies scoffed and explained how "their" rep had called with sweaty palms & coffee voice

---

And how they'd usually just agreed to accept a quote in order to get the dude off the phone or to get him to stop calling

---

When I learned that was the case, I would delete the order and tuck a print out with the reason for the cancellation into a notebook I had

---

It ended up that I did this obsessively for 2 MONTHS nonstop, determined to hack away at the phony orders and get the number down to reality

---

The salesmen, meanwhile ... displayed a fury I had never seen nor experienced in my entire life.  Blazing Red Lantern rage.

---

They held private business-side only meetings I wasn't invited to with the business manager about how they could fire me.

---

--

They couldn't, because I was the employee of the general manager, not the business manager.

---

They wrote complaint after complaint, trying to get me in trouble.  I had concrete factual evidence I had stored in order to disprove them.

---

They demanded a Sunday meeting with the general manager as a group to try to get me fired. The GM said "Dee's doing the job Dee was hired 4"

---

(The GM Related this story to me)

---

It got so bad that even though I'm awkward, autistic and trans, the business sales team took me out to an expensive lunch in order to -

---

- try to woo me into joining the business side as a salesperson (in reality,they wanted this so they could fire me)

---

So I ordered the most expensive things I could find on the menu and then as the food arrived told them I had no intention of accepting

---

They tried to convince me otherwise for a minute and I said "I'm going to stop acknowledging anyone who discusses me joining the sales team"

---

And they sat there -- all 11 of them -- eating in silence as I chowed down

---

Their fury grew as their quote log shrank.  By the time I was finished, two months later, the total quote value: $18,327.

---

They lashed out in absolute debilitating anger.  Two of them lost their shit and tried to hit me in the break room on two occasions.

---

Their last ditch effort was to claim I had lied and canceled orders without directive from the customer just to spite the salesmen

---

Which is when I pulled out the detailed notebook where I had written out all the corrected phone numbers, names and cancellation reasons

---

With times and dates and other details.

---

Whether coincidentally or synergistically or as a result, the business side folded completely three months later.

---

These men had given me absolute hell for months, so I was not sad to see them go.

---

One of them had explained to me I didn't understand that business was about greasing wheels, subjective reality, dealmaking.

---

Being autistic, I of course argued that an honest, direct approach HAD to better in the long term.  He called me a fool.

---

He gave me this horrible book:

[Image of a book by Bob Farrell]

---

Basically, the premise of the book is that reality is rubber and that the rules of doing business should vary by person.

---

That you should wheel and deal with everyone and not apply rules to and the whim of people should determine your business ethics.

---

If someone 1) demands something for free, the book argues, 2) promise it to them and then they'll come back and -- uh,do it again. 3) PROFIT

---

He gave me the book and I looked at the cover as the salesman told me "you need to have an attitude like this guy to win in business"

---

I replied "I thought business was about mutuality of purpose and not winning and losing."

---

That's when he called me a fool and told me to read it and I'd know.  "Ah," I said.  "Bob Farrell wrote this."

---

The salesman beamed "Yes!  You know him?"

---

"Farrell's Ice Cream Parlors" I said

---

"YES!" he beamed.

---

"The company that's currently liquidating its assets due to multiple bankruptcies."

---

" ... I don't know that that's true," the salesman said.  "He's very successful and-"`

---

---

I pulled up the then-current liquidation info on how Farrell's was looking for protection from creditors due to liquidation.

---

I handed him back the book and said "thanks, but that's ok."  I've since read it in order to try to understand how people think like tbis

---

As I exited, this man said "DAMN IT!  YOU JUST DONT KNOW HOW BUSINESS IS DONE!" In a shriek.

---

Two people poked their heads into the break room and blinked

---

I shrugged and went back to handling quotes.

---

The next day, there was a secret pink slip on my desk.  Along with all the other salespeople

---

Except my letter inside was from my general manager --  it said "We don't want the salespeople to become angry today because they're fired"

---

It said "don't make a fuss today,just go home and come back tomorrow -- you're still hired"

---

I took joyful advantage of the free extra day off, and came back to work the following Monday" (the letter said tomorrow but my ne t was M)

---

As luck would have it, when I got back to work on Monday and sat behind my desk, the vicious salesman who had berated me was there.

---

He was yelling at the general manger about how nobody understood the value of men like him any more, salesmen who knew how to MAKE DEALS!

---

As he exited, he stared at me, walking past with his box of stuff off his desk.

---

And, as flatly as I could, I said to him: "Looks like they gave you the pickle"

---

Now, you know that scene in BATMAN 89 when The Joker kills the gangster with the arrow pen and Bruce freezes ?

---

And Bruce starts trudging toward The Joker in Batman body language?  The salesman began walking toward me w/exactly that same body language

---

I legit became frightened.  Fortunately, another of the salesmen came out of nowhere and pushed the man gently to the side and they left.

---

Now here's the point of this.  To me, this is precisely what needs to be done to every single bigot on twitter.

---

It's not possible to actually address the false reality in which they live.  We have to slide PAST that direct engagement

---

We need to acquire the tools to close their quote book.  Advertisers -- revenue streams --forums.  Force them into reality`

---



Provide facts to media that show the severe limits of their reach.  Shrink their platforms.

---

Expose, expose, expose.  arm yourself with VERIFIABLE FACT.

---

Stuff they can't "heh kek" out of.  They're salesmen selling trash and wheeliedealing it.  Let's not let them.

---

Expose their reality.  Confront them on controllable facts instead of debate.

---

They want the fight to be out there in the "marketplace of ideas," but they're salesmen and you're (hopefully) not.  Don't be a salesman.
