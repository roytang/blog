1. The main reason people give up on their ideas is they underestimate the effort gap: the time it will take to go from idea to fruition

---

2. Our culture romanticizes ideas - we think idea are precious. They're not. Ideas are everywhere. It's choosing to follow them that's rare

---

3. We romanticize inspiration. When we find an idea we have (shallow) inspiration - only lasts a few days. Not enough to fill effort gaps.

---

4. To deliver on an interesting idea can take weeks (new project at work) or years (a novel or a movie). We miscast the motivation we need.

---

5. No matter how many films Scorsese makes, or novels Atwood writes, when they get a new idea it still takes years of effort to deliver.

---

6. The primacy then is not the talent of CREATIVITY - but instead it's COMMITMENT - the choices we all make about how we spend our time.

---

7. Of course successful creative people see the world in an interesting way, but it's their commitment to their ideas we should admire more.

---

8. If you quit on your own idea after a few days, after the epiphany rush is gone, how important could it really have really been to you?

---

9. Thee are far more important things in life than creativity: helping your community, being a good friend and solving real problems...

---

10. But if you study carefully, creativity isn't hard to figure out. Effort gaps (and then skill and quality gaps) play the central role.
