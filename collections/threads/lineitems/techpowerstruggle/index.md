title: Alan Cooper on the power struggle in modern tech companies
---

Creating good user interactions with technology is not a design problem. It’s a power struggle. 1

---

I’ve made this “power struggle” assertion for many years and it is more true today than ever before. 2

---

But the nature of the power struggle has changed dramatically in the last few years. It used to be about power and control at the middle-management level: engineering vs marketing vs design vs sales. Typically petty fights over turf. 3

---

All those turf battles are still there, but now there a new 800-pound gorilla in the struggle for power on the road to making good products. 4

---

The extreme corporate consolidation in the tech world (in the world) has changed the nature of business discourse. Making products that please users isn’t even on their radar. They make products for the sole reason to create cash flows to entice tech giants to buy them. 5

---

So, there’s a power struggle all right, but it’s not about the PRACTICE. The struggle to win the tech lottery has utterly overwhelmed the whole concept of designing for ease of use and ease of learning. 6

---

That is, what investors and CEOs are doing has little to do with what users care about, and the focus of designers is (or should be) solely about what users care about. 7

---

Mostly, people take it for granted that companies are in business to make good products and establish a "going concern.” Sadly, that is not the game played by the VCs and executives in business any longer. 8

---

In many (if not most) cases, a company can make the most money by being the nastiest and unfriendliest to actual users. By delivering less and less, they make more and more. 9

---

It’s difficult for us to see because we are deep in the pot of slowly boiling water. We techies develop strong compensatory tools so we can deal with the obstructions put there on purpose by tech companies. 10

---

We figure out how to navigate around the shit services and failure-to-interoperate purposefully delivered to us by Apple, Google, Facebook and other tech giants, but normal people can see the shit and they hate it. Sadly, normal people tend to blame technology. 11

---

We have to deal with thirty different communications platforms because the vendors refuse to make them work together. They do this to attack their competitors, and not to service their users. 12

---

We have to subscribe to multiple different music vendors and video vendors and game vendors because they refuse to play nice with others. 13

---

This isn’t like the local shoe store failing to support another shoe store down the street. These are common carriers providing fundamental services that we all need for our daily lives. 14

---

All of these now-private services should be public owned and governed by publicly accountable administrators. Adding insult to this injury is that most of the tech innovations were built on publicly funded research, too. 15

---

So, as a tech practitioner, you know that the best and most important step that Apple can take to create a better user experience is to have Apple’s products interact nicely with those of other vendors. GOOD FUCKING LUCK getting THAT to happen! 16

---

(I’m not picking on Apple. Substitute the company name of your choice and the point remains valid). 17

---

Today’s power struggle is with the 800-pound gorilla of the inescapable imperative of late-stage, unconstrained capitalism. Making software easy to use is child’s play compared to that. 18
