title: 'rhein_wein: 100% Capacity Scheduling Math'
---

Scheduling your team at 100% capacity is a great way to ensure that nothing will be delivered on time.

There is some cool math behind why this happens.



Let's take this example: each customer at a bank takes an average of 10 minutes to be served. 



One new customer comes every ~10 minutes.



With one teller window open, the wait time is FIVE HOURS. 

Not minutes. Hours.

<time id="1526186846337740800">[21:04]</time> On paper, the example above sounds ideal. The teller can keep up with the flow of customers at a steady pace. But these are average rates, and "average" isn't reality.



Some customers will need 20 minutes to be served. And sometimes, three customers might come at once.

<time id="1526186849114329088">[21:04]</time> As systems approaches 100% utilization, wait time quickly skyrockets. 



These systems are brittle. Stress or unexpected load on a system close to 100% will have effects that are felt for hours, sometimes days.



It's why we have traffic jams.

<time id="1526186851953823746">[21:04]</time> This is also why a sick day, an urgent customer request, or a critical bug can delay planned work by days, weeks, or even months when the team is already scheduled at 100%.

<time id="1526186854768291841">[21:04]</time> Here's a bit of cool math: 



In the bank example, adding a second teller reduces the wait time. 



Not by 50%, because you have twice as many tellers, but by 97%. 



The average wait time with two tellers is just 3 minutes.

<time id="1526186857519665152">[21:04]</time> By giving your team just a little bit of slack, you can create enough capacity to handle surprises without significant delays to original timelines.

<time id="1526186860275388416">[21:04]</time> In short:

- Scheduling your team at 100% capacity makes it harder to hit deadlines

- Systems close to 100% utilization have almost no ability to rebound from interruptions

- Even a small amount of slack time enables a team to respond to interruptions without impact to timelines

<time id="1526915563473326083">[2022-05-18 21:20] </time> Iâ€™m running a workshop series next week about defining and measuring development team performance. Would love to see some of you there!
