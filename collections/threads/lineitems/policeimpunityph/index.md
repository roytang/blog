I don’t talk about my clients and their affairs. However, today, I gained a very valuable one. And I feel it is important that I share my pent-up feels and frustration on this.

---

He is by no means rich. He was just doing his below minimum wage job*, attending to a customer, when policemen in civilian attire came and invited him to the barangay for questioning. When he asked why, he was told to just come with them.

(Job withheld to protect identity)

---

He left his customer mid-transaction, and called his wife to tell her to meet him at the barangay. But he never met her there. He was taken to the precinct.

---

There he was cuffed and told that he was arrested for being among the Top 10 in the drug watchlist. (Watchmojo? Watchmojo?)

---

No lawyer. Not phone call. No nothing.

---

When his wife asked for the details of his arrest, they refused to tell her anything but his being in that list.

---

Two days in detention, he was subjected to inquest. Then four days in detention, the wife finally got hold of me through common friends and relations.

---

Today, when we visited him, I introduced myself to the police as his lawyer. I asked for the details of his arrest and if whether or not he has been through inquest proceedings.

---

They showed me the blotter/spot report from the night of his arrest. In there, it shows my client’s name with some other persons’, arrested after — WAIT FOR IT— a buy-bust operation for Sale, Use, and Possession of unlawful drugs.

---

They also tried to “educate” me of their “process”, saying that it will be months until my client can see the inquest resolution and his day in court.

---

We left the precinct knowing that my client, who was just minding his own business, will have to face criminal charges for an imaginary bust. Ano to? May quota ba tayo jan sirs na di naabot?

---

Today, I am reminded of why I became a lawyer in the first place. 



While I cannot change the entirety this awful, awful scheme, I will at least count myself in on the war against human rights violations.

---

Thank you, policemen of that precinct, for trying to teach me your “process” — y'all should talk to Rex Book Store about publishing your horseshit. I am not interested.

---

I will see you bitches in court.
