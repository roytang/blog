title: "beka_valentine: Thread about NFTs and property "
---

NFTs are a massive scam but they are also a beautiful anthropological device that demonstrates the fact that private property is, and has always been, a social construct

---

forget for a second all of the silly cultish nonsense that we see with the apes and people "investing" their kids college funds into NFTs, ok, that's not what i mean

---

ok i had a thing to go to, so let's get back on the subject of NFTs and social construction if property

---

there are at least two big selling points of NFTs as a "legitimate" tool, rather than as a clear scam:

licenses to use a work publicly

and full deeds of ownership

---

HOWEVER

---

they want actual enforcement to be based on The Blockchain, independent of what the Law is capable of doing

the world of atoms is always going to require some amount of atom based enforcement

but the world of bits is somewhat different

---

as NFTs have become a major thing, we've also seen companies like Twitter, Discord, Deviant Art , etc start to incorporate NFTs into their products in one way or another

one such way is detection when some image uploaded to those services are similar to existing NFTs

---

this means that there is a mechanism that already exists which can be used to enforce an NFT automatically: the copyright takedown

a company like twitter can in theory prevent you from uploading an imaging if you do@not prove that you bought the NFT for that image

---

the NFT can, in principle, serve as electronic proof that you have the right to tweet that image

but what's more  unlike normal DMCA takedowns, this can be automated and can in principle be used to enforce ANY license rules that are encoded in the NFT

---

as long as Twitter participates in this NFT system, the code of the NFT is law

sure you have rights under whatever country you live in, but under the new NFT property game, you are playing defense

---

suppose you post something under fair use doctrine. that is your right under US law and you are a US citizen

but twitter takes it down because you haven't proved that you bought the NFT

---

so now you can either take Twitter to court with all the money you have, or you mangle the image in hopes that twitter can't recognize the image

and then their next version of image fingerprinting comes along and takes down the image. and on the fight goes

---

you don't have the money to fight in court so you pick option two and now you're in a cat and mouse game with the neural net image recognition system that gets fuzzier and fuzzier

---

and that means you're liable to be hit with an auto takedown for something that isn't even relevant! algorithmic false positives are rampant!

---

so what do you do? you buy the NFT and tweet the exact original version of the image so that twitter doesn't complain. you accept the NFT property regime even tho your LEGAL rights say you don't have to

oh well!

---

but that's not all!

suppose you're an artist, and you want to tweet your own pictures

are you allowed to???

well, if someone ELSE minted the NFT for the image before you, you're fucked over. fraudulent NFTs are rampant but also maybe not illegal

---

i mean it's not illegal to sell a square foot of the moon so why should minting an NFT for something you don't own be illegal?

so what does the poor artist do?

well if you want to share your work and publish it on Twitter, it's not enough to merely OWN it, you need the NFT

---

so now you as an artist have to mint NFTs for all your works before anyone else does, if you want to make sure that twitter recognizes YOUR right to use YOUR art in your twitter feed

---

fraudulent NFTs are a tool for coercing artists to participate in the NFT economy at the threat of potentially losing control of their art

which means all of that artists fans are required to participate too, if they want to share the art that the artist made

---

so now we have the mechanisms for automatic enforcement of entirely fictional NFT """law""" for any digital thing. pictures, music, videos, poetry, novels, scientific papers, software

you name it

---

and what happens, what IS happening right now, is the normalization of the idea that property rights and ownership and fair use and licensure can, and SHOULD, be encoded on blockchain systems, and automatically enforced via software mechanisms

---

we are not at the point yet that this has come true -- twitter isn't automatically enforcing NFT ownership YET, Deviant Art isn't enforcing it YET

but this is the plan, the roadmap. that's where this is headed

---

and once you've been desensitized to NFTs for art and music, you'll find it no problem at all to accept NFTs for other things that the current NFT narrative hasn't yet reached in popular consciousness, but which they ARE talking about

---

we've already got DRM in printer ink and John Deer tractors and car parts, @doctorow has written a LOT about this

it's a small step from automatic enforcement of NFTs for pics, to putting your printer ink and your farm equipment on the block chain

---

there are already products that encourage you to link your purchase to the blockchain! if they can, theyll FORCE you to do it with DRM

---

and as far as US copyright law is concerned, the DMCA says they can do that because that's just how the circumvention clause works. they can put locks and you can't break them without violating the DMCA, so if they want to put stuff on the blockchain well tough for you

---

you think  NFTs are just about selling stupid ape pictures 

i helped build one of the largest crypto currencies and let me tell you

they are coming for EVERYTHING

---

oh bye when i say they're coming for everything, i don't just mean ownership

your birth certificates, your IDs, you insurance, your citizenship

they want it ALL to be on the blockchain

NFTs are just one small step towards the normalization of putting everything up there

---

they want you to vote on the block chain, to get paid for work on the block chain, to prove you own your home on the block chain

and they're not just doing it here in the first world with rich dopes buying ape pics

---

blockchain tech is being promoted to poor african countries as the solution for land ownership records and their governments are cash strapped enough to consider it, especially if it's "free"

what new forms of cyberized colonialism do you think is going to emerge from this??
