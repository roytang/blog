My WeChat &amp; Tiananmen: A thread.

I have long had the same WeChat account, opened in the US with a US number. 

Recently, I decided to change the password. Never one to miss an opportunity to test boundaries, I used the most CCP-offensive password I could think of:

F*ckCCP89

Without the asterisk, of course.

Now to be clear, this is not something I go around saying or thinking or promoting. I just wanted to make this a test.

What would happen? Would my WeChat account, opening in the US, with a US number, somehow be affected?
