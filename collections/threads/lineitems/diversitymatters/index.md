`1/ Right, we're at SDCC, first time I even met @rafaalbuquerque face to face after working on BLUE BEETLE together for a year. We're doing a signing, one of my first  ...

Hey, here's a fun question for you creators out there: 

Tell me the nicest/coolest/friendliest/most touching thing a viewer/reader/player/consumer/fan/stranger has ever done or said in response to or in support of your work?

2/ A Hispanic kid comes up, maybe 10, blows right by me to get Rafael's sketch and autograph, because he's 10 and writers don't mean shit to him. But, bemused, I look at the young dad, a guy about my age ... and he's crying.

---

3/ Silently, sure, but his face is just soaked. I ask, "Hey, man, are you okay?" And he says "... I just never thought he'd have a superhero who looked like him."

---

4/ Now let's get this straight -- it was Keith Giffen's decision to have Jaime be of Mexican-American descent. I went along with it, I liked the choice but put zero thought into it. Just tooled along, bulled through the fan backlash.

---

5/ But that moment, as a white guy, it just fucking punched me. Sure, I was a good liberal, blah, blah, but I'd never seen the real power of representation, up close, like that before.

---

6/ That moment, right there, is why, when I here all this "SJW" "forced diversity" bullshit, my only response is ... fuck you. Fuck your petty charred fucking little tiny mind. How DARE you deprive someone of this feeling you take for granted.

---

7/ No quarter, no tolerance for people who want the world of imagination to be smaller rather than infinitely varied, Just nothing. Fuck you, and I'll meet you on field to settle it.

---

8/ I thank fate I've had the luck to work with so many people who were better than I, and who broadened my personal and creative world, like Keith and Cully and Rafael and a hundred others. I'm monstrously flawed, but I least I know the shape of it.

---

9/ I hope that kid's off making something cool. I hope that Dad's doing okay,  That's it. /fin
