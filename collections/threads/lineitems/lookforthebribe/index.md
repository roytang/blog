If a very smart person says something uncharacteristically facile, look for the bribe.

---

A bribe is not just money. It's confirmation of belief, a payoff for existing worldview. Harm avoidance. Or it might be *self-absolution.*

---

Nobody is 100% pure. The ability to tolerate intellectual corruption & cognitive dissonance in others (and ourselves) is healthy—to a point.

---

Everybody has a point. And everybody SHIFTS that point...based on "bribes."

---

For example, I still read Ezra Pound, though he was anti-Semitic. Because of his genius, and his influence on T.S. Eliot.

---

I'd end a friendship over anti-Semitism. It's a non-negotiable for me. But the bribe of poetry/thought has me compartmentalize Pound's flaw.

---

This year, I've been deeply thinking about bribes, or rewards.

---

I think a lot of anomalous behavior we observe is due to bribe-taking.

---

If you've followed me for a while, you may have come across my theory that the white Evangelical church accepted a bribe to vote for Trump:

---

the appointment of a pro-life Supreme Court justice.

---

We think of bribe as an envelope with crumpled bills. But I'm saying cognitive and conformational bribes are as strong and pervasive.

---

It strikes me how much ancient morality (the Bible, Chinese law, etc.) delineated the evil of bribes & their justice-perverting effect.

---

I believe that all around us, there are debased concessions fueling the corruption that's rampant in the United States IN EVERY SECTOR.

---

Hollywood, politics, Wall Street, civil service, law, sports, media. Not just sexual exploitation. Financial. Social. Racial. Class.

---

That's why my conclusion is solid and—I assert—INDISPUTABLE:

---

that Trump's election is merely evidence for deep, despicable corruption in our political parties, power structures & civic institutions.

---

That in every sector with courage to look, there will be revelations of sexual harassment, favors, ignoring red flags, shielding offenders..

---

(Again: bribe-taking.)

---

That's why our most pressing issue isn't nativist nationalism, economic progressivism, equality, safety, immigration, tech, healthcare.

---

It's personal virtue. It's national reform. An anti-bribery mindset. Ethics. Civic honesty. Incorruptibility. A turn from self-interest.

---

(I know, I sound like an old-timey preacher here. Can somebody shout out an amen? Do I have me a witness??)

---

There's an obscure Bible verse, that encapsulates 2017 better than any Atlantic essay or NYT thinkpiece:

---

“In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.”

---

"Chaos"

---

Bribery is about seeing. So not only are we in a culture that "sees with their own eyes" (self-referential anti-empathetic ignorance)...

---

...for the right price (tribal dominance, contempt for our antithesis, more power, etc.) we accept the facile eyes, "the corrupt narrative."

---

Because what truly is a bribe at its deepest level? 



"I WILL CHANGE THE NARRATIVE FOR PERSONAL GAIN."

---

More specifically, "My voice, my sight, my complexity, my truth, my duty, my narrative, my mutuality, my humanity is transactional."
