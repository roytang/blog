I just finished a PhD diss abt "reason" in relation to the public sphere so w apologies I might risk a short thread re: punching nazis -

---

- bc there is an unstated self-evident logic that I feel like might be clarifying. Feel free to mute or unfollow or w/e

---

every liberal democracy realizes early on there are some positions which must prima facie be aggressively excluded from public discourse

---

u can't even articulate WHY they are unreasonable bc to articulate WHY they are unreasonable is to itself open the possibility of reason.

---

this is why u can't allow "just hypothetical" questions abt whether Jews or blacks, as Spencer posits, are innately inferior/destroyable.

---

Nazi theorists like Carl Schmitt VERY QUICKLY diagnosed this weakness in liberal democracies -

---

U can collapse a democracy by insisting the democracy had a right to end itself: Hindenburg to Hitler, "the peaceful transition of power."

---

Intolerance cannot be tolerated, bc this corrosive effect means the law can be co-opted by, and so protective of, fascism.

---

Fascism wriggles into democracies by insisting on right to be heard, achieves critical mass, then dissolves the organs that installed it.

---

WHICH MEANS the stronger it becomes, it cannot be sufficiently combatted with reason. Bc "reason" becomes the state's tool to enforce.

---

The Overton Window becomes weaponized - as we are seeing in @KellyannePolls and @seanspicer's "alternative facts." The state decides.

---

Liberalism literally cannot see this - its insistence on rule of law, not genocideal lust, is what turned the German people into good Nazis.

---

some positions must be excluded from discourse. Some positions you do not listen to - u can only punch.

---

A society that begins to entertain why some members of its polis might not belong invites catastrophic decay. Those voices must be excluded.

---

TL;DR - punching a nazi is actually a supreme act of democracy bc it will not tolerate a direct affront of a fellow citizen's citizenship.

---

the term to interrogate in "should you punch a nazi?" is SHOULD - what is the status of that "should"?



Legally: no; ethically: fuck yes.

---

All of American history is an exercise in one debate: "who is the 'we' who are the people?"

---

(the thing that used to solve this debate - "God decides what is reasonable" - is not on the table anymore, and was always a deferral of Q)
