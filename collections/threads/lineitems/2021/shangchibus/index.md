title: 'that_mc: Bus Operator reviews Shang-Chi Bus Scene'
---

Finally watching Shang-Chi, here as a bus operator to rate the SFT transit factors of The Bus Scene:

<time id="1459613130636492802">[04:04]</time> SFT (San Francisco Transit?) is using a New Flyer D60 articulated 60 foot motor coach for the 1 California. 

{{< photos 1459613130636492802 >}}

<time id="1459613137628368899">[04:04]</time> But the bus is headed south on Noe at 21st St, they are seriously off route! 

{{< photos 1459613137628368899 >}}

<time id="1459613145480122371">[04:04]</time> I like these brushed steel and green cushion seats, they look nicer and harder to clean than muni's 

{{< photos 1459613145480122371 >}}

<time id="1459613152790810630">[04:04]</time> That's a real ad  for the jazz and blues festical you can find in muni buses 

{{< photos 1459613152790810630 >}}

<time id="1459613160474771460">[04:04]</time> As a bus operator, this is the moment I pop my parking brake and open the doors. 

{{< photos 1459613160474771460 >}}

<time id="1459613168037097473">[04:04]</time> This would Definitely Happen 

{{< photos 1459613168037097473 >}}

<time id="1459613174777331712">[04:04]</time> Energy sword arm man cuts through the floor of the articulating section. Also wears sensible boots for working on a bus! 

{{< photos 1459613174777331712 >}}

<time id="1459613182398369794">[04:04]</time> This cuts through an air hose under the bus! 

{{< photos 1459613182398369794 >}}

<time id="1459613192879960064">[04:04]</time> Our bus operator, played by Michael-Anthony Taylor, discovers his service brake isn't working. He's mashing on the treadle (pedal) and not stopping. That's terrible! And he's wearing earphones. That's terrible. He definitely could be charged with an avoidable incident by SFT. 

{{< photos 1459613192879960064 >}}

<time id="1459613201851584515">[04:04]</time> He should be reaching for the Parking and Emergency Brake on his left control panel: 

{{< photos 1459613201851584515 >}}

<time id="1459613206863695872">[04:04]</time> Cap number 8964 would be a part time operator at muni, but SFT might have a different scheme? 

{{< photos 1459613206863695872 >}}

<time id="1459613215151702021">[04:04]</time> Now we are heading west on California at Mason St, and this is a serious hill. There could very well be cable cars in the way. Not to mention this has been a 40 minute bus ride from 21st and Noe, minimum. 

{{< photos 1459613215151702021 >}}

<time id="1459613219106947073">[04:04]</time> Quick digression on how Air Brakes work. Energy sword arm man cut the brake lines, which would let all the air out of the system. When this happens, a backup, mechanical brake called the Spring Brake activates.

<time id="1459613220516159496">[04:04]</time> The spring brake held open by air pressure. If there is no pressure, the brake is applied, and the wheels will not turn. Air brakes have a warning, that is audible as a very loud, continuous buzzer, whenever the air pressure drops below a certain threshold.

<time id="1459613221942292481">[04:04]</time> A bus operator will stop the bus when this low air pressure warning goes off, because if the air brakes keep loosing pressure, the spring brakes WILL activate, and the bus is going to stop very very suddenly.

<time id="1459613223393509376">[04:04]</time> Bus operators don't want to stop very hard because that's how you get Falls On Board.

<time id="1459613230528020481">[04:04]</time> When bus operators want to know what's going on inside our passenger area, we look in the mirror up top, not over our shoulder 

{{< photos 1459613230528020481 >}}

<time id="1459613239822598145">[04:04]</time> This helps us keep our attention on steering the bus, to avoid cars that will definitely make illegal left turns in front of us all day every day. Powell and California. 

{{< photos 1459613239822598145 >}}

<time id="1459613247363969024">[04:04]</time> OUCH 

{{< photos 1459613247363969024 >}}

<time id="1459613255849054215">[04:04]</time> Operator wasn't even wearing his seat belt! Workmans Comp not going to cover this. Also: Fall on Board. 

{{< photos 1459613255849054215 >}}

<time id="1459613264728317952">[04:04]</time> This is top quality bus driving. Also get the line "Every time I try to drive a bus I get yelled at" which a) lol and b) that's just being a bus operator. We get yelled at whenever we try to drive a bus too. 

{{< photos 1459613264728317952 >}}

<time id="1459613273058267140">[04:04]</time> I'm going to take this part by part. First of all, I want to get into the operators seat this easily just once in my entire life. 

{{< photos 1459613273058267140 >}}

<time id="1459613281211981828">[04:04]</time> This space isn't empty, there's a big compartment with computers and electronics in there. 

{{< photos 1459613281211981828 >}}

<time id="1459613288652697601">[04:05]</time> Operators lunch! 

{{< photos 1459613288652697601 >}}

<time id="1459613576918798340">[04:06]</time> Seat Belt, should have been fastened! 

{{< photos 1459613576918798340 >}}

<time id="1459614222086664193">[04:08]</time> This is the parking and emergency brake. This is what the operator should have pulled way back when Shang-chi threw the first punch. If you are ever in a situation where you are unexpectedly in a run away bus and need to stop it, this yellow handle is the thing to grab. 

{{< photos 1459614222086664193 >}}

<time id="1459614742218100736">[04:10]</time> Some operators really do sit with the seat all the way down and the wheel up and forward, but I find this very uncomfortable, like driving with your chin. When a bus operator takes over a bus, they immediately start by adjusting the seat to their preference. 

{{< photos 1459614742218100736 >}}

<time id="1459615141075435525">[04:12]</time> Shang-Chi knows how to check on the passengers! 

{{< photos 1459615141075435525 >}}

<time id="1459615536887709697">[04:13]</time> Every bus has a fire extinguisher, and we check every day before we pull out of the yard. It is intended for exactly these situations. 

{{< photos 1459615536887709697 >}}

<time id="1459615892405243911">[04:15]</time> Every bus operator cheers when the scooters get mashed to shreds. 

{{< photos 1459615892405243911 >}}

<time id="1459616133879721986">[04:16]</time> I think this is more or less how an articulated section would react. I don't actually operate articulated motor coaches, so IDK 

{{< photos 1459616133879721986 >}}

<time id="1459616655047229443">[04:18]</time> This is Stockton at Bush, on top of the Stockton Street Tunnel. 

{{< photos 1459616655047229443 >}}

<time id="1459616886526603265">[04:19]</time> I have no idea if this is what's down there. 

{{< photos 1459616886526603265 >}}

<time id="1459617451209945088">[04:21]</time> The rear view mirrors are bus operators best friends. We cannot safely turn the bus if they aren't adjusted properly. I would take a moment to check and make sure they are how I like them after this. 

{{< photos 1459617451209945088 >}}

<time id="1459617693162618881">[04:22]</time> This is how everyone asks to be let into the bus when we aren't at a stop. Too real. 

{{< photos 1459617693162618881 >}}

<time id="1459618248253603841">[04:24]</time> I'm impressed that she knew how to operate the door lever. When the doors are open, an interlock activates that prevents the bus from moving. This would also have been an option to try for an out of control bus. Also, that's where you keep your coffee canteen, true facts. 

{{< photos 1459618248253603841 >}}

<time id="1459618556979544065">[04:25]</time> DON'T LOOK OVER YOUR SHOULDER WHILE DRIVING! The hazards are ahead of you. Aim High in Steering, everyone. 

{{< photos 1459618556979544065 >}}

<time id="1459618991035482112">[04:27]</time> Now we are heading into the Stockton Street tunnel. This is MC Escher's Hill, apparently. 

{{< photos 1459618991035482112 >}}

<time id="1459619627235897344">[04:30]</time> I Laughed. So. Hard. at the stop request gag. Saw it coming from miles away OMG. On Muni, someone would absolutely have used this within 20 seconds of the start of the fight. 

{{< photos 1459619627235897344 >}}

<time id="1459620099027963906">[04:32]</time> We are finally coming to a stop at Larkin and North Point. Quite a ways to warp from Union Square IMO. 

{{< photos 1459620099027963906 >}}

<time id="1459620652705480704">[04:34]</time> This is the look I give passengers when I stopped too far from the curb. Good bus stops are hard. I hope you enjoyed my thread as much as I enjoyed this scene. 

{{< photos 1459620652705480704 >}}

<time id="1459621208207421440">[04:36]</time> Unfortunately I think this guy isn't going to keep his job as a bus operator, though. I'm glad he's ok, that was a nasty knock he took. Let's hope he lands on his feet. Maybe he'll drive charters? 

{{< photos 1459621208207421440 >}}

<time id="1460006750745026562">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> I need to add a coda to this thread. First of all, amazing to see it get so much attention. I did not expect this. I guess this is where I make a soundcloud plug?

<time id="1460006752229859329">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> But really I just want you to support public transport by riding the bus more and driving a personal car less. Support policies that fund public transport, and support policies that prioritize people over parking spots.

<time id="1460006753878233090">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> And thank your operator when you get off the bus. Every "Thank you" makes our day on the road a little better. I'm still a rookie operator, new to the job, but it make a difference to me.

<time id="1460006755362955267">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> Also mad props to all the talented people involved in bringing this scene to the screen: [@SimuLiu](https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/) and [@awkwafina](https://twitter.com/awkwafina/) and Michael-Anthony Taylor and [@big9nasty](https://twitter.com/big9nasty/) (energy sword arm man, or razorfist, I learned)

<time id="1460006756793208835">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> Brad Allan and Andy Cheng, choreographers for the scene, and the stunt performers, and the stunt driver (Kial Butler, Andrea Berchtold, and Cameron Ambridge have stunt driver credits in the film)

<time id="1460006758680653828">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> And also the special effects teams that put in I am sure untold hours to bring this scene to life. Huge congratulations and thanks to those who brought us this entertainment.

<time id="1460006760329084928">[2021-11-15 06:08] </time> And THANK YOU each and every one for riding Muni.
