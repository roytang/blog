title: 'Jonathan Korman: The Nature of Truth'
---

A parable about the nature of truth, from my day job



(thread)



1/

---

As a user experience design consultant, among my duties I do a few different kinds of research, and I do a lot of presenting with PowerPoint decks.



I devote a lot of effort my presentation materials; I feel pride when clients admire them presenting complex ideas clearly.



2/

---

Occasionally clients ask for my help in assembling PowerPoint decks of their own.



This is fun, easy, good for my studio’s client relationships, and makes the world a tiny bit better by spreading wisdom about making non-gawdawful presentations.



3/

---

Several years ago, a client in a large organization asked for me to take a day or three to help their colleague from another part of their company to put together a presentation about some research they had done.



4/

---

So this person shows up at my office with a huge stack of binders full of research reports.



They say, “We need to figure out how to explain to people in Department X how this research shows that we need to pursue Policy Y.”



I say, “Great!”



5/

---

”OK,  just walk me through it,” I say. “Tell me in your words how you came to your conclusions, and then once I understand it well we can figure out together how best to explain it clearly, succinctly, and convincingly.”



They say, “I don’t understand.”



6/

---

“What don’t you understand?” I ask.



“How am I supposed to know how this research shows that we should do Policy Y?” they say.



“I’m sorry,” I say. “Is this not your research?”



7/

---

“Well, some of this research we did ourselves, some of it we paid for,” they say. “But what does that have to do with anything?”



“It doesn’t matter so much how it was done,” I say. “I was asking how it lead you to Policy Y.”



“How the research lead us to Policy Y?”



“Yes?”



8/

---

“I don’t understand. Policy Y is what we have decided to do,” they say.



“Yes, how did you decide that?” I ask.



“What does that have to do with the presentation?” they ask.



This conversation is weird, and it is hard to conceal my embarrassment and irritation.



9/

---

“Okay, “ I say. “You did the research, you looked at it, you thought about it, and then you realized that you needed to do Policy Y. So what in the research told you that? How did you figure it out?”



“That’s what I want you to explain!” they say.



10/

---

“I’m sorry,” I say. “I think the folks who set this up confused me. Let’s start over. Can you tell me what you need me to do?”



“I need you to find the data in this research which shows that we need to do Policy Y, so I can convince Department X to do it,” they say.

😮

🤭

😧


12/

“Okay,” I say, “let me see if I am following you. You have already decided to do Policy Y, for your own reasons. You want to persuade the people in Department X. So you want to dig through all this research for arguments in favor of Policy Y.”



“Yes!” they say.



13/

---

“I’m sorry we had a misunderstanding,” I say.



“It’s okay,” they say, “so shall we get to it?”



“Uh, no. We have had a misunderstanding about what I do for a living.”



“Aren’t you a research consultant?” 



“Yes, I am, among other things.”



“So what is the misunderstanding?”



14/

---

“I do research, and analyze it, to help clients make good decisions and make good products and services,” I say.



“Right. So I need help analyzing this research,” they say.



“No, you don’t need to analyze that research, you want to use it as a tool to persuade someone.”



15/

---

“Right, I need an analysis of how this research supports Policy Y!” they say.



“What I do is look at research and figure out what policies and solutions it suggests,” I say. “That is a different thing.”



“I don’t understand the difference.”



“Yes, that is clear now.”



16/

---

“I am very sorry to have wasted your time,” I say. “Obviously our studio will not bill you for my time, because of the misunderstanding.”



17/

---

It should be evident that I have abbreviated a longer, stranger conversation.



The important thing is that this person was baffled by what I was talking about.



18/

---

The idea that one should use evidence to draw a conclusion, rather than simply to support a conclusion, was entirely foreign to them. I could not communicate to this person what I meant.



19/

---

This person was astonished that I considered myself professionally obligated to refuse this work. They just could not see what my objection was.



Wasn’t this what researchers did? Wasn’t this what consultants did?



20/

---

Understand, I am not against trying to be persuasive. That is a necessary art.



But it was troubling that they couldn’t conceive any other relationship with data.



I have reluctantly come to believe that there are more people like them than there are like me.
