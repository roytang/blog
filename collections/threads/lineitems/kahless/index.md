title: 'NomeDaBarbarian: The wisdom of Kahless'
---

In this time, remember the wisdom of Kahless the Unforgettable.

"Long ago, a storm was heading for the city of Quin'lat. Everyone took protection within the walls except one man who remained outside. Kahless went to him and asked what he was doing." /

"The next day, the storm came, and the man was killed.

The wind does not respect a fool."

Like the wind, the plague upon us shall not respect a fool.

Do not dishonor your house; nor let your name be spoken as a curse in the halls of warriors. Armor yourself to fight this enemy, and wash your fucking hands.

Such is the wisdom of Kahless. #StarTrekTaughtUs #StarTrek'
