Write. Keep a journal or write a blog. As long as you write regularly.

Writing lets your sort out your thoughts and clarify them and lets you learn how they should be organized.

Donâ€™t worry that other people might not like what you write, you can write for yourself (at least at first). Writing for yourself is a lot like meditation, except that the physical act of typing out or manually writing out your thoughts can make it more satisfying and give a better sense of permanence.
