Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [What is the general size limit of a method or variable name?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-general-size-limit-of-a-method-or-variable-name/answer/Roy-Tang)


The idea is to keep them as short as possible. If I had a variable name of say 20 characters, Iâ€™d already be raising eyebrows at that and looking for ways to trim it.

If you find that your variable or method names are generally too long, you may be violating the [Single responsibility principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle)
