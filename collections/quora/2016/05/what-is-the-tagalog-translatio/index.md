> [What is the Tagalog translation for "deeply"?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Tagalog-translation-for-deeply/answer/Roy-Tang)


Adverbs don’t work the same way in Tagalog as they do in English. Most adverbs will be a phrase combining an adjective with something else, with the exact form depending on context, usually “nang”.

For example, “deeply”’s root adjective is “deep”, which is “malalim” in Tagalog.

“He was stabbed deeply by a knife”  -> “Sinaksak sya <b>nang malalim</b> gamit ang kutsilyo”

“I loved her deeply” -> Minahal ko sya <b>nang malalim.</b>
