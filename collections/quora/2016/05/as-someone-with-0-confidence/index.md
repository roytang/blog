Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [As someone with 0 confidence, how can I be confident?](https://www.quora.com/As-someone-with-0-confidence-how-can-I-be-confident/answer/Roy-Tang)


Fake it ’til you make it. Don’t worry about how to be confident, just pretend that you are. Everything else follows.

Also, be more comfortable with who you are. Don’t worry too much about what other people think about you.
