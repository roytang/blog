> [Does emotional pain change someone mentally?](https://www.quora.com/Does-emotional-pain-change-someone-mentally/answer/Roy-Tang)


I had a friend who underwent some serious emotional pain and it really changed her: she started distancing herself from people who used to be her friends and she became quieter and more withdrawn

There is a quote, often attributed to Stephen Aitchison:

“People change for two main reasons: either their minds have been opened or their hearts have been broken”

I have found this often to be true, though it really only refers to drastic change. People also tend to change or evolve little by little slowly over time.
