You probably mean learning programming enough to work (unless you are really a fan of the theoretical applications of computer science). There are many ways to learn programming online (regardless of whether Filipino or not). A CS degree is hardly necessary. All you need is a decent computer and internet. Lots of short courses, books, tutorials available online. You just need to choose what you want to learn
