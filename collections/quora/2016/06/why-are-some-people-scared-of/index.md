It’s a bit like how some people are scared of math. It’s hard and it looks arcane and exact and unforgiving and if you don’t understand it too well it’s easy to get lost and have no idea what’s going on.

Sometimes it’s just a matter of presentation though. Maybe those people were first exposed to programming in a difficult way, focusing more on syntax and other arcane things instead of programming as a way of thinking and stepping through problems. Math has this same problem too!
