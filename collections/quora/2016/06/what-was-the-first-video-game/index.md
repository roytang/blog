I suppose it depends on what you mean by “real story” and where you want to draw that line

I mean, a plumber’s girlfriend is kidnapped by a giant ape and he has to climb some ladders to get to her, that’s a story. Donkey Kong (1981). It’s not particularly long or complicated, but it’s a story

The first game in the Ultima series (1981), told a more complex story involving an evil sorcerer, a powerful artifact and a time travel twist

Super Mario Bros (1985): Later they extended that concept to create an entire fantasy kingdom with a lineup of bad guys and castles, it was still a story then

The Legend of Zelda (1986): How about a young boy who is given a sword by a mysterious old man and he has to wander lands filled with dangerous monsters cryptic npcs and recover powerful artifacts from deep dungeons?

Dragon Quest (1986) and Final Fantasy (1987) introduced the epic fantasy tradition to consoles

Maniac Mansion (1987) kicked off a whole new genre of adventure that focused entirely on story and puzzle-solving
