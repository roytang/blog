The best way to learn is to actually participate in an enterprise application project. You wonâ€™t get everything you need from a book, particularly things on how to work well and communicate well with a team. That being said, I would suggest reading the following books:</p><ul><li><i>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</i> by The Gang of Four</li><li>Refactoring by Martin Fowler</li><li>The Pragmatic Programmer by Andy Hunt and David Thomas</li><li>Peopleware - Productive Projects and Teams by Lister and DeMarco</li><li>Rapid Development by Steve McConnell</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That should give you a relatively good/balanced foundation to build on
