Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

(a) Knowing what is the right thing to do

(b) Getting the right thing done

The above two are two very different things. A person can be good at one but not the other. Being an intelligent person isnâ€™t particularly relevant to (b), although it can be relevant to (a). (b) is more determined by drive, determination, motivation, etc. than intelligence
