Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Would musical geniuses (such as Mozart) or literary geniuses (such as Shakespeare) be great scientists or mathematicians?](https://www.quora.com/Would-musical-geniuses-such-as-Mozart-or-literary-geniuses-such-as-Shakespeare-be-great-scientists-or-mathematicians/answer/Roy-Tang)
