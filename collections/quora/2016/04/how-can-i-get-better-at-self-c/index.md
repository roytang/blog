The best thing about trying to develop self-control is that there are a lot of opportunities everyday to practice it. Just try something like: whenever you have an impulse for something (like to buy a new thing that you just found about, or sudden urge to have an unhealthy snack), try to delay it until the next day

Introspection and self-awareness helps too. Analyze your wants and needs so that you're aware what things you really need and which ones you can easily defer or outright ignore.
