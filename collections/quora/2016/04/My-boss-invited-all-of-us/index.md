No, that's fine. Don't do things you don't want to do. Of course, there may be social consequences, but I assume you've weighed those already :p. As long as your boss is a well-adjusted person it should be fine though. People getting married are much more preoccupied with the their own problems than with guests who can't attend. Just don't say you'll go then not go
