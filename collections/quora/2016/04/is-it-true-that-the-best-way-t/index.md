Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Is it true that the best way to learn to program is to jump into a project?](https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-the-best-way-to-learn-to-program-is-to-jump-into-a-project/answer/Roy-Tang)


I'd like to say yes because that's how it is for me, but the truth is it depends largely on the person trying to learn. Different people learn in different ways, some learn better if they do a lot of reading ahead of time, while others will find it easier to just jump in and try stuff and poke around. Try different approaches and figure out what works best for you
