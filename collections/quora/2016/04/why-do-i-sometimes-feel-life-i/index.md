Life is just about as interesting as you choose to make it. If you feel a lack of challenge in your life, you might want to try upping the difficulty level a bit. Or explore life to find new things and challenges and expand your horizons.

Ask for more responsibilities at work.

Look for new interesting hobbies.

Hang out at places you don't usually hang out.

Meet new people. Preferably smarter people. People who can challenge you.

Live life to the fullest!
