There's this exercise I've been trying for about a month now: [This 3-Minute Exercise Will Actually Fix Your Posture](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/this-3-minute-exercise-will-actually-fix-your-posture/)

I think it's made some improvement, I don't know how much.

If your back is hurting consistently, it might be be better to consult a doctor about it.
