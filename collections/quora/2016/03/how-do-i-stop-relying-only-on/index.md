It's an understandable bias, always needing perfect information before moving forward and taking action. But it can be paralyzing, and there are situations where you will need to act quickly and with minimal information. As in many things in life, it's important to strike a balance and know when to wait for more data or when to move forward with what you have.

If you are having difficulty with this, you might need to practice being more spontaneous. Ask your friends to help you with this: ask them to drag you along on sudden road trips without telling you where you're going, or to surprise you with random situations where you have to react quickly

Good luck!
