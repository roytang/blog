> [If I have a goal for the week, what is a useful system (low or high tech) I can put in place to make sure it's accomplished?](https://www.quora.com/If-I-have-a-goal-for-the-week-what-is-a-useful-system-low-or-high-tech-I-can-put-in-place-to-make-sure-its-accomplished/answer/Roy-Tang)


It can be something as simple as a checklist that you verify at the end of the period to make sure you've done all the necessary things. Add a reminder/notification to your phone to remind you to do the thing you have to do for your goal. Tell your friends about your goal to keep you honest.
