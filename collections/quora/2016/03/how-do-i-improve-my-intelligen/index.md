Practice, and practice a lot.

Read, read a lot. Be critical of what you read. Question everything. Try to spot biases or holes in logic.

Hang around smarter people. Try to emulate how they think.

Write. Write analyses on things that interest you. Show your analyses to other people and see what they think. If they point out flaws in your arguments, study those flaws, find out if they are indeed flaws or if you have counterarguments.

Solve puzzles. Crosswords, sudoku, logic puzzles. There are magazines that make tons of these.

Cultivate a learning mindset. Try to learn something new everyday.
