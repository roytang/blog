> [Why do teachers make kids write a 2000 word essay when a 500 word essay would be clearer and more concise?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-teachers-make-kids-write-a-2000-word-essay-when-a-500-word-essay-would-be-clearer-and-more-concise/answer/Roy-Tang)


Minimum length requirements are inflated to take into account the BS that students write. If students write 500 words of meaningful response + 1500 words of BS for a 2,000 word essay, then for a 500 word essay, you're likely to get only 125 words of meaningful response.

And even the mere act of thinking up 1,500 additional words of BS is something, at least you're trying to think about things tangentially related to the topic at hand.
