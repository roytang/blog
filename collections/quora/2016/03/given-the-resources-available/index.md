Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Given the resources available, why didn't Native American cultures develop more advanced metal working skills than they did e.g., iron working skills?](https://www.quora.com/Given-the-resources-available-why-didnt-Native-American-cultures-develop-more-advanced-metal-working-skills-than-they-did-e-g-iron-working-skills/answer/Roy-Tang)

I would suggest reading Jared Diamond's "Guns Germs and Steel" which delves into these differences and their effects on the advancement of cultures in different continents
