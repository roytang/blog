Don't let negative people get you down. Most often the people trying to drag you down are insecure about their own position and in seeing you working hard they feel some insecurity because they are stuck in their own mediocrity. As long as you are doing what you believe is right and you are not hurting other people, you shouldn't worry about it.

If those people are affecting you negatively, you might want to consider avoiding them or cutting them out of your life entirely
