Hahaha no.

Assessing programming skill is highly difficult and subjective. There's not even an objective metric that would take *a year* to measure. Sure, in a year's time you could figure out whether a programmer is "good" or "bad" (already subjective), but even then comparing against other programmers ("better" or "worse") will still be highly subjective. There's nothing like say "programmer A is 89%, while programmer B is 72%, so we'll pick programmer A"
