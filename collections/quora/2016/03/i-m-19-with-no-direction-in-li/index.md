No, it's not foolish to have dreams. But don't let your dreams stay dreams. Figure out what kind of work you plan to do for yourself and how you're going to get there. Step-by-step, as detailed as possible. Take the first steps to get to your goal. Review your plan on a regular basis and make sure that either you are still on that plan or you want to take a different direction.
