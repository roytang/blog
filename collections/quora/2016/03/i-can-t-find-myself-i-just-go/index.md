Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [I can't find myself, I just go with the flow. My life is slipping away. I'm not interested in anything and feel unhappy about it. How can I handle it?](https://www.quora.com/I-cant-find-myself-I-just-go-with-the-flow-My-life-is-slipping-away-Im-not-interested-in-anything-and-feel-unhappy-about-it-How-can-I-handle-it/answer/Roy-Tang)


Finding a purpose in life is a life-long pursuit. It won't necessarily come easily. It may come early in life or it may come late. Don't let the lack of it lead to despair. Instead, enjoy life and explore it as much as possible. Try out as many new things as you can. Walk down unexplored side streets. Pursue strange and unusual things. Don't give up, just keep trying different things. 

Think about school subjects you've taken and put them in a list. Now sort that list according to which subjects you found most interesting to least. Now you have some indication of where your interests may lie. It may not be a strong indication, but it can be a good place to start
