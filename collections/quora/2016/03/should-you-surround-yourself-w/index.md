Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Should you surround yourself with experts to help you improve?](https://www.quora.com/Should-you-surround-yourself-with-experts-to-help-you-improve/answer/Roy-Tang)


Not necessarily experts, but at least hang around some people who are better at you in the field you are choosing to improve in. Not all experts are created equal - some may not be able to impart their knowledge effectively. In that case, you may be better off hanging out with people who are not necessarily experts but at least a few notches above you in expertise, so that it makes it easier to take the leap to their skill level.
