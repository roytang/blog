Some things to try:

1. Try to remember your goals - why are you doing this thing in the first place? Imagine yourself achieving that goal. Is it worth it to power through the difficulty and get there?

2. Try to figure out the next step to get there, don't worry about how many other steps there are in front, just worry about the next step

3. Take a break. Let your subconscious mind stew on the problem for a while

4. Find something that pumps you up. Maybe have a confidence-boosting playlist
