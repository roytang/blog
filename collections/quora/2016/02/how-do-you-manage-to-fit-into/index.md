The correct answer is to start looking for a better work environment.

In the meantime, or if you can't leave, or you prefer to stay and work things out, you have to be patient. Raise your concerns to your superior, and maybe to his superior if you have access. Do your work, don't be obnoxious. Maybe start keeping a list of major problems you see with the code. When one of those problems does blow up later, point out how you could have prevented it, and suggest to incorporate preventive measures as a best practice. Point out how much less costly it would have been to prevent the problem instead of reacting to it. 

Changing an organization's culture from within is a long, tough grind though, so I'd keep looking for greener pastures
