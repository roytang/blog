It's hard to answer unless you have specific goals, but here are some tips:

1. Learn to save. Some say 10 or maybe 20% of your income, but I'd say "as much as you can"

2. Understand how credit card debt works and how to avoid it

3. Get a job, if you are legally allowed to. Even part-time is fine. Online freelancing could be great too

4. Learn to control impulse purchases. Take some time before buying something big.
