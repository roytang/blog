Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Life Advice: Is it true that nobody is useless because everyone has at least one skill in their life they are better at than the vast majority of people?](https://www.quora.com/Life-Advice-Is-it-true-that-nobody-is-useless-because-everyone-has-at-least-one-skill-in-their-life-they-are-better-at-than-the-vast-majority-of-people/answer/Roy-Tang)


This is a statement that is impossible to prove as true or false. There may be people who appear to have no useful skills yet we cannot say for sure, as they may have skills yet to be discovered. 

That being said, you should not allow yourself to feel restricted. If you seek the answer to this statement simply to reassure yourself that you are not a useless person and there is a skill that you have yet to discover, stop that kind of thinking. You're only a useless person if you think you are. Don't stop exploring life and looking for things that may interest you or that may turn out to be a useful skill.
