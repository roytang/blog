Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [What are the most common life mistakes young people make?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-life-mistakes-young-people-make/answer/Roy-Tang)


1. Loving too hard and too quickly

2. Believing they are invincible

3. Not learning to manage finances or debt

4. Getting too attached to their ideas

5. Believing they can control every situation

6. Believing life is fair

7. Not recognizing the wisdom of elders

8. Not taking care of their teeth

9. Limiting their social circle

10. Not seeing more of the world

11. Accepting everything without question

12. Committing to a path before they are sure it's right for them

OK, I guess these are mistakes older people make too :)
