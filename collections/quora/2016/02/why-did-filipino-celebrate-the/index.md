> [Why did Filipino celebrate their independence day from Spain, not US on June 12?](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Filipino-celebrate-their-independence-day-from-Spain-not-US-on-June-12/answer/Roy-Tang)


For a while, July 4 was the Philippine Independence Day, but in 1962, it was changed back to June 12. This is to recognize the date we as first declared independence as a nation as the first republic in Asia. Just because our independence was interrupted by a few decades of American and Japanese colonisation doesn't change it :p
