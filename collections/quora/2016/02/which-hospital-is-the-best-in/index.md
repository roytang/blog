Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [Which hospital is the best in The Philippines?](https://www.quora.com/Which-hospital-is-the-best-in-The-Philippines/answer/Roy-Tang)


The high end ones in Manila are Makati Medical, St. Luke's and maybe Chinese General (I'm Chinese so many of my relatives like to go here)

I was at Makati Med the other week to visit a relative and the hospital is very nice now, they've upgraded recently.
