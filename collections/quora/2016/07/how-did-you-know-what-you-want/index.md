Often it’s just luck. But not everybody is lucky enough to find something that interests them and they are able to make it into a viable career. That being said, there is no reason to ever stop looking for something better.

You say you are not doing anything that you like. So I guess this means you know what you do like, right? Start exploring options that revolve more around activities you like. Join hobby groups related to your interests. Meet new people who work in related fields. Ask them how they got started. Read about different work opportunities related to your interests. See how viable they would be for you, etc.

If you don’t know what you like, just try a lot of different things until you find something that interests you. Even if interests you just a little, it may lead to something else which is even more interesting that you could turn into a career.

You don’t have to settle for what you have now if you’re not satisfied. There is a lot of life to explore, somewhere out there is the right path for you
