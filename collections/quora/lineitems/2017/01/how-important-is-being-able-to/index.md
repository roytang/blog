If I were looking at a resume that had a TA/mentoring position on it, what it would tell me is not only that the applicant knows enough to be able to help other developers but also that the applicant has at least some skill in communicating his ideas to other developers, particularly to ones that may be less experienced.

The ability for software developers to communicate well is seldom mentioned in job ads or whatnot, but I would consider it a vital skill especially as team and project sizes scale up. Obviously not everyone who evaluates a resume may consider this important, but it probably wouldnâ€™t hurt to put it there.
