It's never too late to be who you were meant to be.

I would suggest studying an easy-to-learn programming language and getting into the basics of algorithms and data structures. Personally, I'd recommend Python, but it doesn't really matter what programming language you choose, your initial learning stage should only be to get you familiar with programming concepts and constructs.

When looking for a job, look for the ones geared towards fresh graduates that may be offering training for new hires. This puts you on a more even field with people who have been programming for longer.
