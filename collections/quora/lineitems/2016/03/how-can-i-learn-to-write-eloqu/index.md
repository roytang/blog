Practice, practice, practice.

What is it you want to write? Practice that, as much as possible. Want to write novels? Write shorter stories first, maybe even just snippets of prose whenever you have free time. You want to write nonfiction about a certain topic? Start a blog about it. Write often. Answer questions on Quora about the topic.

When possible, put your work up for the world to see, so that you might improve. Look for like-minded people and hang out with them. Take a writing class.

Read. Read a lot. It will help you recognize what are good forms of writing and what are not. Read the sort of things you expect to write. Be critical of your reading. When you finish reading something, ask yourself "Was this a good piece? How could it be improved?"

Writing eloquently is not the domain of journalism though.
