Practice solving puzzles to get better at math. Not necessarily math puzzles (those are fine), but also logic puzzles will help. Try the book Satan, Cantor and Infinity

For remembering things, try to exercise your memory in everyday locations. For example whenever you go to the grocery store, choose a thing that you like to buy, say potato chips. Look at the row of potato chips on sale and try to memorize the order of the brands as arranged on the shelf. Then the next time you go to the store, see how well you remembered it.

You can also look into/research the memory technique called the memory palace. There's a TED talk about it somewhere.
