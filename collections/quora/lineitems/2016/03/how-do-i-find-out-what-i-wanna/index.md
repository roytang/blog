The only real way to find your purpose in life to try a lot of different things and see what sticks. Find out what makes you happy and pursue those things.

That being said, I've found that many young people will not be able to find the right path for them immediately. And that's fine. Life is to be lived, and your purpose can come early or it can come late. The important thing is to live a fulfilling life, to make sure you are exposing yourself to as many different things as possible to make the most of life
