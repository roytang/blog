It is always difficult to let go of someone especially if that person was significant in your life. It will come mostly with time, slowly and it's something you can't really hurry. Try to train yourself to redirect your thoughts to something else whenever you think about this person, and keep yourself occupied to avoid stray thoughts. You may never ever forget that person completely (I sometimes find my thoughts wandering back to someone I knew 20 years ago!), but eventually you'll get to the point that you can move on.
