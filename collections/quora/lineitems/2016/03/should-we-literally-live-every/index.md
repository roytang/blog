"Dream as if you'll live forever. Live as if you'll die today" - James Dean

Living each day like it's your last doesn't mean giving up all your earthly possessions or not paying your bills or burning bridges etc. It means making the most of each day and the opportunities it provides. It means not putting off for tomorrow things that you could do today. It means cherishing the people important to you. It means letting go of things that do you no good or otherwise waste your time.
