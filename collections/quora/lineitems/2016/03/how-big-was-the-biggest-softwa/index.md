The biggest was a case management system (that's pretty generic, I know), a web application written mostly in Java, that involved a development team of some 30-40 people, of which I was the technical lead. The system was pretty large - case management consisted of a lot of different types of records and there was a significant finance component. The system included a customisable workflow engine of which I was the primary architect.
