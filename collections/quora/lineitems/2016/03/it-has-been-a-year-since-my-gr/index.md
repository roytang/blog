Moving on doesn't mean forgetting her. Don't dwell too much on her death; whenever you find yourself thinking about that topic, try to refocus your thoughts to her life and to your good memories together with her. 

It might be difficult to let go, but it will come eventually with time. In the meantime, try to find new ways to occupy your mind and keep you distracted. A new hobby or something else to direct your attention to. Ask your friends to help you with this as well.
