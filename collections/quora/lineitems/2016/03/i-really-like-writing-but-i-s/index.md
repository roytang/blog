Everyone, no matter how talented, will question themselves at some point. It's natural, but don't let it dictate your life.

Is writing important to you? If yes, then ignore the instinct to question yourself and just write. Write, write, write. Write until it becomes second nature, like breathing. Write until these thoughts fade to the wayside. Write until you can't write anymore, then write some more.
