It's more risk (i.e. the company might go under). You might have to do a lot of admin work yourself (managing your SSS, Philhealth, taxes, etc). 

Established companies will tend to have better benefits (HMO, vacation days, etc) too. 

On the upside, working for a startup generally means a looser culture, and a smaller company means you have greater influence over the culture there. Established companies will already have a lot of policies and rules in place.

In general, the difference between startups and big companies is the same in the Philippines as it is elsewhere, but startups here seem to be focused more on bespoke work for other companies, as opposed to the startup scene in silicon valley which is focused on products and apps.
