Not necessarily. But if they are preventing you from achieving your goals you should consider whether the goals are more important than your friends. You can also consider trying to get them interested in the things you do differently than them.

Friendships are great, especially when they are a positive influence. But there are also friends who are toxic, negative people who can drag you down. You can try to change them or help them improve, but past a certain point you have to seriously consider just letting them go. It feels bad to give up on a friend, but ultimately you have to prioritize your own life goals.
