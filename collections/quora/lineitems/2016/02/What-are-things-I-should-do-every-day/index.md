Almost any new habit that you manage to pick up and do on a daily basis will change your life in one way or another. I assume you're looking for positive changes so I wouldn't recommend say, smoking

Some ideas of things you can do on a daily basis:

1. Learn something new, or improve on something you already know

2. Challenge yourself

3. Step outside your comfort zone

4. Reach out to a friend you haven't talked to in a while and try to reconnect

5. Reach out to a stranger you find interesting and see if you can connect (it might be someone famous even, it's ok if she fails to respond!)

6. Read a book in your area of interest

7. Some form of exercise, even if it's light

8. Meditate

9. Get a proper amount of sleep and drink eight glasses of water

10. Look for a way to help someone else

Good luck!
