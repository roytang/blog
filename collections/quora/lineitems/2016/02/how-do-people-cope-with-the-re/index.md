All the challenges you face professionally in order to be competitive, everyone else faces those same challenges too. You don't have to be the absolute best at whatever it is you do, life isn't about competition. 

You need to keep a balance between competitiveness (the struggle to always improve) and serenity (the search for happiness and satisfaction). Find the level you're comfortable with, there's no need to push yourself to exceed beyond the point you can handle.
