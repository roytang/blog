For a while, July 4 was the Philippine Independence Day, but in 1962, it was changed back to June 12. This is to recognize the date we as first declared independence as a nation as the first republic in Asia. Just because our independence was interrupted by a few decades of American and Japanese colonisation doesn't change it :p
