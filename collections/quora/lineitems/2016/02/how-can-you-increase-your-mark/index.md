The most important skill for a software engineer is communication. You need to be able to communicate what you can do, what solutions you recommend, why something is a bad idea, etc.

Be aware of what skills are in demand and try to get some experience in those.

Be a good team player.

Have a good understanding of software engineering principles, especially those related to good code, maintainable code, refactoring, etc.
