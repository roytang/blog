Coding is very much a detail-oriented task. The syntax of most programming languages makes that obvious - forget a semicolon somewhere and your entire program may fall apart. Even non-coding roles in a software development team such as business analysts require some degree of attention to detail as otherwise they would be doing substandard work.

However, your question is whether you would *enjoy* coding. It is possible you may enjoy coding even though your attention to detail is low. If you love things such as problem-solving or learning how things work, there's a good chance. The only way to be sure is to try it!
