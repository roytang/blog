For large products, support and administration can indeed pretty much grow to be a full-time job. It can be a viable option for you if you are interested in the burgeoning Dev Ops field.

However if you have concerns with how this affects your career or how it will take you in a different direction that you want, itâ€™s a good idea to discuss this directly with your manager. Just say that you are willing to help with the support tasks, but you would still like to have some coding work as well. Ask if perhaps the support work could be split with another willing developer, or could it be a temporary assignment while they look for someone else to help?
