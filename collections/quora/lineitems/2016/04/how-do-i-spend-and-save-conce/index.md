It depends on how predictable your day is. If there is a constant risk of crises coming up as the day goes on, it becomes more difficult. Making it more complicated is that people really aren't very good at assessing how much additional work they can take on without starting to lose focus.

In general, the best idea would probably be to do the most important things, the ones that require your most attention, early in the day when your mind is the most sharp and creative, instead of risking doing them later in the day when intervening crises may have sapped your concentration and focus.
