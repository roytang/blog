It would depend on the problems you are trying to solve. If they can be solved by brute-forcing all the possibilities within a given scope, then yes computer programs can help solve them. Typically however, any problem that *would* be solvable by this method already has been solved.

Also, it will only work for problems that can be perfectly simulated. For most physical experiments this is not feasible; since the computer program can only simulate what humans know well enough to be able to input that data into a computer. Quantum mechanics tells us that there will always be uncertainty at the quantum level so perfect simulations are not possible. In theory, simulations might be able to help narrow the scope of a problem though.
