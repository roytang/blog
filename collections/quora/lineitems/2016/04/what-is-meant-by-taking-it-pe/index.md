title: What is meant by "taking it personally"?

Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:

> [What is meant by "taking it personally"?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-meant-by-taking-it-personally/answer/Roy-Tang)


When a person is said to take something personally, it means that person considers something to be directly affecting his ego and reflecting upon him as a person. For example, if you try to refute a person's arguments and he takes it personally, it means he gets offended by your counter-argument as if you were attacking him as a person instead of just his arguments. Or taking one's work personally means if there's a problem with your work you think there's a problem with you as person.

Not taking things personally means being able to detach ourselves from the things we interact with.
