Well, what is the criteria to be considered the best in your field? For a real estate salesman I would guess it's to generate the most amount of sales among the salesmen in your area right? 

First, maybe you can figure out who is the salesman currently considered as the best in your field. Figure out how much he's making. Figure out how many sales he makes, how much margins they usually have. Then ask him for tips! If he doesn't want to talk to you, that's fine, no loss there! You can also try talking to his clients, ask them what made them willing to buy real estate from that guy.

Copying other people can only get you so far though. The real way to get ahead of the pack is to hustle. Get busy. Work hard. Practice on your pitch. 

The only way to be the best salesman is to sell more than other people. That means making more pitches than everyone else and improving on your pitches so that you can convert more of them into sales than everyone else!

Aiming to be the best in any given field is a huge goal to work towards, but it can be worth it!
