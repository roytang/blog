If you live in the Philippines, it's easily the best University in the country. As compared to the other two generally considered to be tops Universities (Ateneo, DLSU), you get exposed to a wider variety of both professors and students. There is a significant culture of activism and political involvement (if that's the sort of thing that you like) - except maybe for the College of Engineering, where I found it to be minimal. Because of the varied population of the University, there's generally something there for everyone.
