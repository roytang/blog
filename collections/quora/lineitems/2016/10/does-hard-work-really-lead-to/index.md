There are rarely any guarantees in life. Heck, there isn’t even a guarantee that you’ll wake up tomorrow morning. That being said, hard work is more likely to lead to success than not working hard, but still no guarantees

You feel frustrated because your chosen path is not working out, that’s a very common thing. But what if success for you is not what you expected, or you need to get there through a different route than you imagined? Working smart is much more valuable than working hard. And working smart means being willing to think outside the box and explore different options to achieve your goals. Instead of trying the same things or the same approaches again and again which are not bearing fruit, see if there are other alternatives for you. Maybe your classmates can give you some advice, or maybe your school offers some sort of counseling service to help you with your career goals
