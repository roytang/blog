As soon as you become aware you’re stuck is a pretty good time in my opinion. If you already know you’re stuck and not going to move forward, why put it off? Sometimes a couple of minutes with a fresh set of eyes is all it takes to get some progress, so it makes no sense to hold off until you are truly desperate. That being said, be sure not to interrupt your colleagues when they are in the flow!

Sometimes you don’t even need your colleague to answer or pay attention too much, the mere act of describing the problem to him may light up some neural pathways that make clear the way forward.
