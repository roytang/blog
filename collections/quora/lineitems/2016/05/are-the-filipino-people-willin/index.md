Corruption is actually on the downtrend ([Why Graft Is Declining In The Notoriously Corrupt Philippines](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2015/03/02/why-graft-is-declining-in-the-notoriously-corrupt-philippines/#1f6b83465aab))

Traffic and internet are bad, but I don’t see how you could possibly compare that to 1789 Paris, unless may alternate timelines involved.

Dissent is at a healthy level and people are perfectly free to criticize the government and oppose their actions. There is no rampant violence on the streets on a daily basis.

We aren’t perfect, and there is a long way to go, but we are in almost no way a dystopia.
