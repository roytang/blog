Anything can become boring if you do it for too long and you let it. Whether you find something boring or not depends more on you as a person that the activity that youâ€™re doing. Stamp collecting seems like the most boring hobby in the world, but there are people who have been doing it for ages.

Any kind of programming is in a class unto itself though, because technology advances so rapidly. There are always a lot of new things to learn!
