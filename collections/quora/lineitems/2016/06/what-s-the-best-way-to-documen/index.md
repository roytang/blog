It depends on what the purpose of the documentation for the non-technical people is

If you’re trying to convince them to try/buy your software, that’s marketing and copywriting, and you have to focus on feature sets and how it will be used by the end user

If it’s for users, to give instructions on how to use the software, typically developers will include some sort of user manual detailing the way to execute various tasks within the application

Regardless of the purpose, documentation written for nontechnical people will tend to focus on use cases and how the software satisfies requirements
