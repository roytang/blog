Show an interest in what they’re into. Say you’re not too familiar and ask for details. People who like things like it when other people ask about those things.

Please note though that it’s perfectly fine to have different interests from other people. People don’t have to like the same things. It doesn’t mean you can’t hang out with them or anything unless you really want to
