There is a phenomenon among competent individuals known as <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" data-qt-tooltip="wikipedia.org" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome" onclick="return Q.openUrl(this, 23351839);" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Impostor syndrome</a></span> - it basically means that even though you are doing well, you feel like you are not really that good and maybe you’re just lucky and that sooner or later someone will figure it out

The easiest way to rid yourself of this mentality is to seek out honest feedback from your peers. Ask them if you’re doing well! Ask them what you need to improve! Be willing to accept and learn from criticism, because when people know that about you they will be more likely to give you honest feedback
