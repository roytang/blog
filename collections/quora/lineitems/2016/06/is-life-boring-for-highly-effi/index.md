Probably not more than inefficient people.

The whole point of being efficient is to be spending less time doing things you don’t like so that you have more time to spend on things you don’t like (which presumably you don’t find boring). So it’s more likely that efficient people are less bored than inefficient ones

Additionally, efficient people will usually find the act of optimizing to become more efficient in and of itself to be an endeavor worth their time, so that part is not boring either
