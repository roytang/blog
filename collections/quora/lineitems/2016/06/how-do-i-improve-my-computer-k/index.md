First, it isn’t necessary for you as a programmer to know these things

Second, do you have a computer of your own? I’ve had and maintained my own computer for almost two decades now, so most of my knowledge of how computers work comes with that experience. I’ve encountered a lot of problems and researched how to fix each one so I have a good idea of how computers work and what fixes are available to common problems. Having your own computer for personal use (not just the one at work) will help a lot. Desktops are better than laptops, since they are more easily customisable

Third, if you don’t already have a computer, build one yourself. Or even if you already have one, either build a second one for yourself and help a friend build one. And by “build” I don’t mean buying one fully assembled already; I mean buying each part individually and putting it together yourself. That means researching what parts are needed and what will serve your needs best and what will be compatible and canvassing for the best prices and finally sitting down and opening all the boxes and putting it all together. I’ve put together five different desktop builds over the past twenty years myself
