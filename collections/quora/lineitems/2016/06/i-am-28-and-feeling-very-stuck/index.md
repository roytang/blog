Well, first you have to have a better of idea of what the “something” you want to do is. It doesn’t have to be super detailed or anything, just a direction you want to go. Then list down whatever small steps you need to do to take you down that road. You don’t need to figure out a complete roadmap, just something to get you started. And if you can’t figure out what steps there are, then that’s one of your first steps. After that, it’s like walking - you simply take one step after the next.

I don’t know what it is you plan or want to do, but here are some general ideas for next steps:</p><ul><li>look for a mentor. Look for people who have walked the path you have chosen or are already experts in the chosen field. Contact them and ask for advice. There’s a good chance they will decline, but some or a few may have a few small pieces of advice as to how you can start</li><li>talk to your family and your friends about what you want to do. Even if they don’t have direct knowledge of the area, they may be able to suggest ways for you to move forward or have contacts that can give you advise</li><li>read! Try to spend each day learning a bit more about what path you want to take and what you would need to get there</li><li>if you’re planning to start your own business, try to find out what are the specific legal requirements in your area to be able to do so. The admin staff at your office may be able to help you with this</li></ul><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Good luck!
