I suspect that in the long run this will be one of those things that doesn’t matter and it will turn out that either before or after works. I would guess that Nick Spencer is writing his first story arc independently of Civil War II. Besides, the focus of CWII is on Tony Stark and Carol Danvers, apparently Steve Rogers doesn’t have that big a role
