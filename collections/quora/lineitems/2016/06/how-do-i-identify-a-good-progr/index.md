Learning to code is not strictly necessary. It would be sufficient to simply have an understanding of how programs execute step-by-step instructions and algorithms. If youâ€™re interviewing programmers, you can simply give them a moderately complex problem and ask them to verbally walk through / explain to you how they would approach the problem (you yourself would need to understand how the problem is typically solved). Sorting algorithms for example, can easily be explained with a few whiteboard diagrams instead of writing code

The larger problem is that it is never easy to identify a good programmer. Even for people who do know how to code! The best way to identify a good programmer is actually to work with them on a project, but of course that option is unlikely during an interview. In general look for high-level skills: ability to step through the solution to a problem (and explain it well), ability to spot possible problems in a given solution (you might try describing a problem you encountered in a previous project and ask how he would address it), ability to work well with others, etc
