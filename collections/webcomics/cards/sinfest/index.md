I [enjoyed Sinfest during it's early years](/2006/10/webcomics-i-like-2006-edition/) (it was one of the webcomics [I first tried to archive via webscraping](/2004/10/sinfest/)), but in later years it transitioned to strong far-right political messages and kind of got cancelled. [TV Tropes has a nice discussion about it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/WebComic/Sinfest).

My personal favorite Sinfest strip of all time is probably this one about apples and oranges:
