"So, what's your New Year's resolution?"

"I resolve to live life on purpose, to take control of my fate, to seize each day as if it were my last. I will be reckless. I will be daring. I will be strong. I will challenge fate. I will defy the gods. Or I will die trying."

"...Why can't you just quit smoking or go on a diet like ordinary people?"

"It's like you don't know me at all. Life is too short to be ordinary."
