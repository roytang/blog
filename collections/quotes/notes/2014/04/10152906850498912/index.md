"What was the start of all this? 

When did the cogs of fate begin to turn? 

Perhaps it is impossible to grasp that answer now, <br/>From deep within the flow of time.  

But for a certainty, back then <br/>We loved so many yet hated so much <br/>We hurt others and were hurt ourselves.  

Yet even then we ran like the wind <br/>Whilst our laughter echoed Under cerulean skies...."
