To laugh often and much; To win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children; 

To earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; 

To appreciate beauty, to find the best in others; 

To leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social condition; 

To know that even one life has breathed easier because you have lived. 

This is to have succeeded.

- Ralph Waldo Emerson
