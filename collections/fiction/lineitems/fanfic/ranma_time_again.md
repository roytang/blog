Time and Time Again
by VECTOR

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Part One

It was the usual lunchtime scenario at the Furinkan High cafeteria. 
Various students were in various states of gobbling. One particular 
student, however, was trying to avoid his lunch. This student, Ranma 
Saotome, had concealed himself behind the cafeteria doors in hopes of 
avoiding the "lunch" his "fiancee" had prepared for him. It wasn't 
exactly normal behavior for such a boy to avoid free food, but the 
fiancee in question was one Akane Tendo, and her cooking could be used as 
nuclear weaponry if only the government realized it.

Another fiancee, however, managed to spot him. This time it was 
okay.

"Ranchan! I brought you some okonomiyaki!" Ukyo Kuonji's voice came 
to Ranma's ears, and Ranma thankfully accepted the okonomiyaki.

"Thanks Ucchan", he said between gobbles.

Suddenly the nearby wall started to break down.

"Oh no...", Ranma said.

And suddenly there was a flash of light.

When the light dissipated, the wall was broken down and a purple-
haired young girl carrying a delivery tray was looking around a bit 
confused. 

"Ai ya! Where Ranma go?"

Ranma and Ukyo had vanished.

to Ranma's ears, and Ranma thankfully accepted the okonomiyaki.

"Thanks Ucchan", he said between gobbles.

Suddenly the nearby wall started to break down.

"Oh no...", Ranma said.

A purple-haired young girl carrying a delivery tray smashed through 
the wall and deftly pushed Ukyo away from Ranma.

"Ranma, I cook special deluxe ramen for ai len!" Shampoo said, 
glomping onto Ranma.

All this had not gone unnoticed to Akane Tendo, and right now she 
was emanating an incredibly red battle aura. 

"Ranma..." she began, rather furiously.

And suddenly there was a flash of light.

When the light dissipated, Ukyo and Akane looked around in shock.

Ranma and Shampoo had vanished.

Part Three

Ranma Saotome felt the sensation and recognized it. It was a 
feeling he regularly had, that of submitting his will to gravity.

He was falling. 

Luckily, Ranma managed to fall into a convenient clump of bushes on 
the outskirts of Nerima, staving off any real damage (which Ranma 
would've been impervious to, anyway). He jumped up to his feet and 
brushed the dust off his red Chinese clothes. At least this time, he 
hadn't landed in water.

"What in the world just happened?" he said to himself out loud. The 
shrubbery he had fallen into was just outside the Nerima cemetery, 
meaning he must've flown quite a long way from the Tendo Dojo. The 
problem was, this time he didn't recall anyone in particular smashing him 
into the sky. He doesn't even recall being at the Dojo for the last 
thirty minutes. To the best of his knowledge, it was presently lunchtime 
at Furinkan High. 

Ranma's musings were interrupted by two familiar voices coming from 
within the cemetery. For some strange reason, Ranma's brain decided to 
kick in and realized something strange was going on. The female voice he 
heard was definitely Ukyo's. The weird part was the male voice. He could 
swear it was...himself.

Confused, Ranma leaps over the wall and crosses to a nearby tree. 
Several yards away, he sees Ukyo, and surprisingly, himself! They are in 
front of a grave, and Ukyo seems to be comforting Ranma for some reason. 
Deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Ranma decided to 
spy on this impostor. Concealing himself in the nearby shrubbery, he 
listened in to their conversation.

"You're doing it again, Ranchan. You keep blaming yourself for what 
happened. Year after year for five years now we've been coming here, and 
you still haven't forgiven yourself." Ukyo's voice came to the (hidden) 
Ranma's ears. "What?" Ranma said to himself, "Ukyo's known this impostor 
for years? Whose grave is this anyway?"

Then he heard the impostor's voice, as clear as his own. "You're 
right Ucchan...I just can't help but remember what she meant to me..."
She? Ranma wondered to himself.

"Come on, Ranchan. It's time to go. Time to move on." Ukyo said, 
moving away with the impostor.

Puzzled, Ranma steps out of the shadows after they leave, then 
walks over and inspects the grave they were visiting. 

"I..it can't be...", he said, shocked, "A--Akane Tendo...died age 
seventeen...". Ranma's brain, which normally could not handle anything 
more complicated than one of Ryoga's schemes, was working overtime. He 
had just been with Akane about an hour ago, insulting her cooking. How 
could she be dead, with her grave here for the past five years? And who 
was that impostor?

"Only one person can explain what's going on here," Ranma muttered 
to himself, "Either that or she's behind it all." 

With that in mind, Ranma ran off in the direction of the 
Nekohanten.


To find it no longer there. This was even more of a visual shock 
for Ranma, as it meant he couldn't get free food there anymore. Besides 
that, he had just eaten at the Nekohanten this morning! Something strange 
was definitely going on.

"Looking for someone, son-in-law?" a familiar old voice came from a 
nearby rooftop. 

Ranma leapt up to the rooftop and found Cologne there. At least she 
still looked the same, if everything else in Nerima had gone crazy. 

"What's going on, old ghoul?" Ranma spat out.

"Ah, son-in-law, you are as impolite as ever, in any time." Cologne 
remarked, "And to think I came all the way from China to visit you."

"China? What were you doing in China? Where's the Nekohanten? What 
do you mean in any time? And what the hell happened to Akane?" Ranma 
indignantly shot back.

"One question at a time, Ranma." Cologne pulls out a folded 
newspaper from within here robes. "Here", she said, passing the paper to 
Ranma, "read it, and tell me what date it is."

"November 16...1999?!"

"That is correct, son-in-law. You have traveled in time, and you 
are now five years into the future."

"Time travel? But how? Why?"

"Stop blabbering for a while and listen to me, boy." Cologne said, 
"You don't have much time."

"Okay." Enough time for what?

"Five years ago, you and Shampoo were sucked into a temporal rift 
near Furinkan High. You ended up five years in the future, as you are 
now. However, in that future, Shampoo was dead, her body found after she 
had mysteriously vanished for months. When you and Shampoo talked to the 
Ukyo Kuonji from that time, she said she had also traveled to the future 
with Ranma five years before, and she had seen a timeline where she had 
died. Apparently, in that other time, the same thing that happened to 
Shampoo happened to Ukyo instead. With their knowledge of their future, 
Ranma and Shampoo came back, and Shampoo's death was averted. Instead of 
Shampoo, however, it was Akane Tendo who met their fate."

"What? How could all this be happening?" Ranma said, confused.

"I believe it has something to do with the temporal rift five years 
ago, son-in-law. After that experience and with the death of Akane Tendo, 
Shampoo withdrew her claim to you out of respect for her, and we moved 
back to China. The present-day Shampoo told me to meet you here so that I 
could tell you all this. I believe that some force at this time, but not 
necessarily in this timeline, is trying to get you, but someone else 
always gets in the way."

Ranma tried to follow all this, failed, tried again, and finally 
got it right. "How can I stop this? If this is the third time it's 
happened, even if I save Akane in the past, it'll happen to someone else, 
right?"

"There is a chance, son-in-law. You yourself must face whatever 
fate it was that would have fallen upon Ukyo, Shampoo, and now, Akane."

"Can you help me?" Ranma said.

"I'm afraid not, for in this timeline, you are a temporal anomaly, 
so you can "Shift" back to your time easily, while I cannot. You are 
alone this time, son-in-law."

Ranma just nodded gravely. 

"One more thing", Cologne added, "when Shampoo came back from her 
temporal journey, she was very disoriented and could barely remember what 
had happened in the past, and she was beaten and bruised. This could help 
you find out who's responsible."

"Waitaminute!" Ranma said, "If Ukyo and Shampoo were with me when 
they time-traveled, then this time..."

"...Akane Tendo would have made the journey with you." Cologne 
ended. "That is correct, son-in-law. You must find her, before any danger 
comes to her. You might even figure out what's going on."

"One last thing, " Ranma said, as the ghoul prepared to hop away, 
"If I do manage to prevent Akane's death, then this timeline is 
destroyed? Do you all die?"

"I don't know son-in-law." Cologne replied, "We might cease to 
exist, or just go on as if nothing happened. We don't truly understand 
the intricacies of time."

"Thanks, ghoul. Gotta go!" Ranma said, heading for the Dojo. If 
Akane was in this timeline, she would head straight for the Dojo. And who 
knows how her old man would react!


In the meantime, Akane was having troubles of her own. She had 
suddenly found herself wandering on some street after eating her lunch. 
Maybe Ranma was right...maybe her cooking did have hallucinogenic 
effects, she thought. That thought had quickly fled her mind and she 
rushed to the Dojo to find out what's going on.

When she got there, everyone seemed shocked to see her, as if she 
had come back from the dead or something. Even more shocking was when 
they told her she did come back from the dead! 

"What do you mean I died five years ago?!", she asked, incredulous, 
while trying to shake a crying Soun off her leg, "Is this some sort of 
sick joke ?", she said, pointedly looking at Nabiki.

Nabiki looked hurt, "It's not like we would fake your death 
Akane...the body was there, we all saw it...Ranma couldn't stop crying 
for weeks..."

"Ranma..." she said, turning to him, "were you really worried about 
me?"

"Akane..." the purple-shirted Ranma said, "I...I always regret not 
having told you before...but I want you to know that I..."


The red-shirted Ranma Saotome had watched Akane enter the Dojo, but 
had carefully concealed himself on a nearby rooftop. As he watched the 
purple-shirted Ranma hug Akane closely, he shifted a bit and considered 
revealing himself and explaining everything.

But he knew no one would listen to him anyway, particularly 
himself. He just had to wait until he could talk to Akane alone.


"Ranma", Akane said, breaking the hug, "I'm confused...just this 
morning I was at school...at Furinkan...how could I have died five years 
ago?" She looked at everyone for an explanation.

"Well, Akane", Nabiki said, "It seems that five years ago, you and 
Ranma vanished in flash of light near Furinkan...when Ranma came back, he 
had no memory of what happened...and when you came back a week later, you 
were near death...we couldn't save you."

"I'm sorry Akane", Ranma said, "If only I had done something back 
then..."

"Oh! My Daughter!!! My Long-Lost Daughter!!!", Soun wailed.



Ranma had caught enough of the conversation to understand what had 
happened. He and Akane had leapt forward five years into the future, and 
Akane did not come back alive from the encounter...which meant that 
sometime between now and their going back to the past, something bad 
would happen to Akane. He would have to stop whatever it was that was 
going to happen...but what was it? And why did it also happen to Shampoo 
and Ukyo? 


Later that night, when Akane was about to go to sleep in her newly-
refurbished room, she heard a knock on her door.

"Come in", she said.

Ranma, still wearing the same purple shirt, came in, and sat down 
next to Akane on her bed.

"What do you want?" she said, a bit annoyed.

Ranma held her hand. "I just wanted to see if you were okay..." he 
trailed off.

Akane was a bit surprised that he held her hand, "Sorry", she said, 
"didn't mean to snap at you."

Ranma squeezed her hand gently, and she squeezed it back.



Outside Akane's bedroom window, Ranma-chan, wearing a wet red 
shirt, was watching them. He waited until the purple-shirted Ranma had 
left the room.


Akane sighed as Ranma left the room. Then she heard a slight 
tapping on her window. When she turned to look, she was surprised to see 
a very wet Ranma-chan, in a red shirt, hanging outside her windowsill, 
asking to come in.

"Ranma!" she said, opening the window and letting him in, 
"wha...how did you get there? I...we were just..."

"Shh...", Ranma said, putting a finger to his lips, "Keep quiet and 
I'll explain."

"Okay"

"You notice how we were in school today, and suddenly you found 
yourself somewhere else?"

"Yeah, I was wondering what happened...but nobody here could 
explain it..."

"Well, I can. Listen..." Ranma proceeded to tell her Cologne's 
story.

"You really expect me to believe something like that?" Akane said, 
"Cologne must have been joking or something."

"There's no other explanation Akane. The Nekohanten wasn't there 
this afternoon, but it was definitely there when I had breakfast this 
morning."

"You mean you had breakfast with Shampoo?!" Akane shouted, "What 
did you think you were doing?!"

The red-shirted Ranma heard footsteps coming and threw himself 
outside the window and flipped up to the roof.

The purple-shirted Ranma and Kasumi opened Akane's door and rushed 
into the room.

"What is it, Akane?" Kasumi said.

"Is there anything wrong?" Ranma said, his concern showing, "We 
heard you shout and..."

"N...no, it's okay. I, um, just saw a mouse, that's all...yeah 
that's it."

"Oh my, a rodent!" Kasumi said, "I'll have to call some 
exterminators!"

"Uh, that's okay Kasumi", Akane stammered, "I threw it out of the 
house."

"Okay", Ranma said, stepping out of the room, "You sure you'll be 
all right?"

"Sure"

Ranma and Kasumi left and locked the door behind them.

Akane went to the window and looked up. "It's okay", she whispered 
to the moon, "You can come out now."

The red-shirted Ranma flipped back into Akane's room.

"That was close", Ranma said, "we can't let them know who we really 
are. They'd never believe it. I know I wouldn't."

"Ranma", Akane said, "If that other person is really you, in the 
future, do you and him have the same, um, feelings? About us, I mean?"

"There's no time for this Akane", Ranma said, a bit embarrassed, "I 
have to go and figure out who or what is up to this..."

"What?" Akane said, "You'll leave me here?"

"You should be safe here, Akane. They can protect you."

"I can take care of myself."

"I know, Akane, you're a martial artist too, and all that." Ranma 
responded, "but whatever it is that hits us here, is going to kill you. 
And I can't risk that happening."

"Ranma..."

"I gotta go. I'll come back when I've figured out what to do."

Ranma stepped out of the window and was about to leap into the yard 
when he heard Akane scream.


Ranma turned around and saw a weird sight. A blue-violet haze was 
forming in Akane's room and there were blue tendrils of energy grabbing 
onto her.

"Akane!" Ranma shouted, echoed by another voice from the hallway.

Ranma tried to stop the pulsating blue trails of energy but he was 
grabbed in mid-air and both the red-shirted Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo 
vanished into the vortex.

The purple-shirted Ranma Saotome crashed through Akane's room to 
find a small energy vortex shrinking out of sight.

Part Four

Akane found herself conscious and tried to move. Unfortunately, her 
hands wouldn't agree with her. They were tied up for the moment, 
literally. She was in a small room and tied to a pole. The building 
looked old, as if it would fall down any second. Numerous crates were 
located in the room. She heard a familiar voice.

"He got you too, huh?" Ukyo's voice came from behind her. 

"Ukyo!" Akane turned to see Ukyo and Shampoo also tied up, all 
three of them around the pole. "Who did this to us?"

"Ai ya!" Shampoo remarked, "Violent girl not know? It was--"

Shampoo's sentence was cut short by a small maroon projectile sent 
hurtling through the far wall. Instead of crashing into the crates, 
however, the maroon blur stopped itself in mid-air and settled down on 
its feet.

"Still can't beat me Ranma m'boy!" Akane recognized the voice; it 
was...

"Happosai!" Akane said, surprised, "So you were behind all this!"

"Ai len!"

"Ranchan"

Ranma had emerged from the hole Happosai had made through the far 
wall. He was burning red with battle aura. His clothes were torn in 
several places and he had a bruise on his right arm.

"This ain't over yet, you old freak!" Ranma spat out.

"You're right, Ranma!" Happosai gloated, "You still have to bring 
me more girlies!"

"Bring...?", Akane said, "Ranma, you...!"

"No, Akane", Ukyo said, "it's not his fault..."

"What do you mean, oh!"

Ranma and Happosai had decided to resume their hostilities, and 
they were moving at incredible speeds. Ranma was dishing out low-level ki 
bursts to Happosai at maximum speed. Happosai, however, managed to dodge 
each and every one.

"Enough playing around, Ranma", Happosai said, landing on a crate, 
"You've got work to do!" Suddenly, Ranma noticed a blue sapphire Happosai 
wore on his neck. The gem glinted a bit and then blue energy formed in 
front of Happosai.

"Time Flare!"

"Ranchan look out!", Ukyo shouted.

Too late. A pulsating blue energy burst flew towards Ranma. Ranma 
leapt out of the way, but the blast followed him and enveloped him. A 
bright light formed around him and he vanished.

"Ranma!" Akane shouted, "What did you do to him?!"

"Why, sent him back in time, of course!" Happosai said gleefully, 
"So he can bring back more girls!"

"What? Where...when are we anyway?" Akane said.

"In your future, of course", Happosai said, as if Akane would 
understand immediately. When he saw she didn't he elaborated, "Five years 
to be exact."

"Why are you doing this to us?!"

"Oh, dear Akane, you don't know how terrible it's been!" Happosai 
whimpered, latching himself unto Akane's chest, "Allow me a moment in 
your bosom to tell my tale." 

Akane fumed a bit, but realizing there was nothing she could do, 
nodded. "Go on."

"You see, in this future, my future, I had accidentally killed you 
all when I discovered the powers of this", Happosai pointed to the gem 
laced around his neck. "This", he continued, "is the TimeStone. It allows 
someone to displace another person through time! So, using the powers of 
the Stone, I sent Ranma to the past, knowing that there'd be girls around 
him for sure, and then I moved him five years into the future, and then 
shifted him to this future!"

"What! You pervert!" Akane shouted, "You're doing all this just so 
you can harass some girls?!"

"You don't understand, Akane", Happosai continued, "In this future, 
the Time Stone gives me incredible powers, and I'm close to becoming all-
powerful. However, I need to be in the presence of pretty ladies to be 
effective! I drain their youthful energy to become stronger. So I used 
Ranma as a temporal female magnet!"

"Wait", Ukyo said, whereupon Happosai immediately leapt off Akane 
and glomped onto Ukyo's chest.

"Yes?" Happosai said.

"Thanks, Ukyo", Akane smiled.

"Grr...anyway, if all this is true, how come Ranma didn't tell us 
when we time-traveled?"

"Well, you see, when I shoot him back in time, his mind also goes 
back in time. He only remembers what's going on when he gets back here."
Happosai explained.

So that's it, Akane thought. "But wait", she interrupted, "In the 
other timelines, Shampoo and Ukyo managed to survive. That means Ranma's 
going to beat you!"

"No way, girl!" Happosai laughed, "Those weren't my timelines. They 
were just branch-offs that resulted from Ranma's perpetual time-jumping. 
Why, you're already the third batch of girls here!"

"What! Where are the others then."

"I sent them back, of course. I can't use them anymore after I've 
run them out of energy. In that state, they're already near-death."

"You monster!" Akane said, realizing why the other Ukyo, Shampoo 
and Akane had died.

"Nothing can stop me, Akane-chan!" Happosai said, glomping on Akane 
again, "Nothing."



"Perhaps you are right. Perhaps not." The voice came from somewhere 
outside the building.

"What the--?!", Happosai said, "That voice..."

"You are indeed a menace, in any time, Happy." The small figure 
said as it came into the building.

"Ai ya! Great-grandmother!" Shampoo said.

The figure was indeed, Cologne, carrying her staff around her. "You 
didn't think I'd come along with Ranma, did you?" Cologne said, "It's 
over Happosai. Surrender the TimeStone!"

"To you? Ha!", Happosai snickered, "I killed you months ago, and 
I'll kill you again !" Happosai leapt towards her.

"We'll see", Cologne said, also leaping towards Happosai.

The battle began.


"Ranchan!" Ukyo said.

"Huh?" Akane said.

"Ai len!" Shampoo said.

"Shh", Ranma said, "Cologne and I heard everything. Relax, I'll get 
you all free." He started to work on the ropes.


"Elemental Storm!" Happosai shrieked, creating a powerful hurricane 
within the building. The roof was blown off and lightning and thunder 
crashed across the sky. He extended his battle aura into the hurricane, 
lighting the night with energy.

"Hiryu Shoten Ha!" Cologne countered with the Dragon Cyclone, and 
soon the area was filled with a storm of lightning and flame.


Ranma, Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo were struggling to stay standing in 
the midst of the powerful display of energy.


"Sorry, Cologne", Happosai said, momentarily halting the Elemental 
Storm, "I have to send you back now. You just weren't good enough." The 
gem around Happosai's neck glowed with power and pulsating blue energy 
gathered around his body.


"No!" Ranma said, gathering his ki, "Mokou Takabishya!"


The ki bolt hit Happosai from behind and disrupted his Time Flare. 
Cologne, however, was exhausted and landed on the ground, breathing hard. 
Happosai turned his attention on Ranma. 

"All right, then", Happosai said, gathering his energy again, "You 
first. Time Flare!"

The pulsating blue energy bolt leapt towards Ranma. Ranma was 
expecting it and leapt high into the air. Th bolt turned before hitting 
the girls and was close behind him.

Ranma twisted in mid-air and made a dive for Happosai. The energy 
bolt turned and followed. 

"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken Maximum!" Ranma said, bringing his fists 
into Happosai.

"You can't beat me, boy!" Happosai said, blocking all 23,000 
attacks. Suddenly Ranma turned sharply and leapt away.

"Scared you, didn't I--Ahh!! No!!!", Happosai's words were cut off 
by the blue energy bolt that slammed into him. The energy bolt had failed 
to turn and had collided with Happosai, enveloping him with pulsating 
blue energy. Happosai faded out of sight. "I'll be back ... " his voice 
trailed off. The TimeStone glistened then fell off his disappearing neck.



"Not bad, son-in-law." Cologne said. They had recovered from the 
battle and were studying the TimeStone left behind. 

"So, how do we get back?" Ranma said.

"This TimeStone is said to be unique throughout all of time. If we 
destroy it here and now, all other traces of it across time and space 
shall be destroyed as well." Cologne said, "In which case Happosai would 
never have found it in the first place."

"Wait", Akane cut in, "What about us? And all those alternate 
timelines? If Happosai never found it, we shouldn't be here, right?"

"It's a temporal paradox", Cologne explained, "Once we destroy this 
Stone, we, and all the alternate timelines, will cease to exist. The day 
will go on as if something never happened. And we will have no memory of 
what happened."

"Oh..." Akane said, sounding disappointed. She turned to her 
fiancee. "Ranma, what I asked you back in my bedroom...?"

"Um, well..."

"Enough fooling around", Cologne said, smashing the TimeStone to 
bits, "Let's go."

And there was a flash of light.

Part Five

It was the usual lunchtime scenario at the Furinkan High cafeteria. 
Various students were in various states of gobbling. One particular 
student, however, was trying to avoid his lunch. This student, Ranma 
Saotome, had concealed himself behind the cafeteria doors in hopes of 
avoiding the "lunch" his "fiancee" had prepared for him. It wasn't 
exactly normal behavior for such a boy to avoid free food, but the 
fiancee in question was one Akane Tendo, and her cooking could be used as 
nuclear weaponry if only the government realized it.

Another fiancee, however, managed to spot him. This time it was 
okay.

"Ranchan! I brought you some okonomiyaki!", Ukyo Kuonji's voice 
came to Ranma's ears, and Ranma thankfully accepted the okonomiyaki.

"Thanks Ucchan", he said between gobbles.

Suddenly the nearby wall started to break down.

"Oh no...", Ranma said.

A purple-haired young girl carrying a delivery tray smashed through 
the wall and deftly pushed Ukyo away from Ranma.

"Ranma, I cook special deluxe ramen for ai len!" Shampoo said, 
glomping onto Ranma.

All this had not gone unnoticed to Akane Tendo, and right now she 
was emanating an incredibly red battle aura. 

"Ranma..." she began, rather furiously, "How dare you eat their 
cooking, and refuse mine!"

"Look, Akane", Ranma said, pushing off Shampoo, "In case you 
haven't noticed, a garbage can would be a better alternative than your 
cooking!"

"Ranma you jerk!" Akane screamed, sending Ranma into LEO at the 
same time.



Ranma landed in the Nekohanten's trash can. Cologne fished him out.

"Having trouble with your girlfriends, son-in-law?" Cologne said.

"I am not your son-in-law!"

Somewhere in China...

The Jusenkyo guide looked out of his window to see a bright blue 
light form over Jusenkyo. The light quickly vanished and a small figure 
of a man hurtled towards the cursed springs.

The Guide rushed to the pools and saw a small frog hop out of a 
nearby pool.

"Aw, too bad.", the Guide said in his weird voice and accent, "You 
fall into Spring of Drowned Frog. Very tragic story of frog that drown 
there seven hundred year ago."

"Ribbit."

This fic is weird. I wrote this after watching some weird time loop 
TV show I couldn't place. Anyway, it's really my first fic, so if you 
wanna say anything 'bout it, send stuff to the Nikholas F. Toledo 
address. If is suck, say so, if I don't you can say that too. Oh yeah, 
please check for misspellings or grammar errors or whatever. I am not 
"SWITCH" OK? I'm just using his address. Oh yeah, could people please 
write more weird time travel thingies. I'm kinda sick and tired of all 
the herbs and spices plots, and I kinda like pointing out continuity 
faults. BTW, does anybody think Ukyou can beat Kunou in combat?

Notes (07/04/2003)
