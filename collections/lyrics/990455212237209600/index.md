"Well, I dreamt I saw you walking Up a hillside in the snow 

Casting shadows on the winter sky 

As you stood there counting crows 

One for sorrow, two for joy 

Three for girls and four for boys 

Five for silver, six for gold 

Seven for a secret never to be told"

-- Counting Crows, "Murder Of One"
