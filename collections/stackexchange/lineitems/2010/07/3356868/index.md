title: What are the methods of protecting JavaScript web applications/games?
---

Back story: I'm planning to implement a casual game to be deployed in a webapp, but I don't want to use Flash, instead just plain Javascript. One benefit of Flash that I would want though is that it distributes a binary and not the source code so it's easier to protect your code from being reused/stolen by somebody else, or to prevent the client from modifying the code to "cheat" in the game?

So my question is: what are the ways to similarly protect a Javascript application? Am I limited to the usual methods of using a code obfuscator? Will that be enough?
