title: Is 75-85C temperature too much for a laptop?
---

I have an Acer Aspire 4920G that I've had for a couple of years, running Windows/Ubuntu.

I have temperature monitors set up so i can see that with time my CPU temps go as high as 85C, sometimes even spiking to 90C. On startup, the temps are around 65C-75C.

How bad is this, and anything I can do to avoid it/reduce the temp? I've already tried to open up the laptop to clean away any dust, but unfortunately some of the screws are really hard to remove. I don't want to take it to a shop before trying stuff out myself as I'm no longer under warranty.
