Some people [suggest turning off eTags][2], especially if you have a load balancer.\r\n\r\nAlso, note, when you press reload on your page, Firefox WILL recheck all the resources. These will come back with 304's.  If you press shift-reload, it will re-request all the resources without etags. So don't use the refresh/reload button to test your last-modifed/etag settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/499966/etag-vs-header-expires\r\n  [2]: http://mrclay.org/index.php/2009/03/03/you-probably-dont-need-etag/", "date": "2010-01-14 04:25:34", "photo": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/jolkN.png?s=128&g=1", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2062066/far-future-expire-header-and-http-304", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2062066/far-future-expire-header-and-http-304", "source": "stackexchange"}
