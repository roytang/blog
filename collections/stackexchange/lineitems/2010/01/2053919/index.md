title: screen sharing library
---

I'm looking into screen sharing functionality - i.e. allowing remote users to view your desktop in real time, possibly control it and write annotations (text/drawings) on the shared screen. Something similar to what webex allows in its conferencing software. Preferably a Java-based api, possibly to run from an applet.

Any recommendations on a library/api to use?
