title: How to install a new linux distro and remove the old one?
---

I have a laptop dual booting to Windows 7 and Opensuse 11.2. However, I'd like to switch to a different Linux distro (probably Ubuntu, that's what I'm used to)

Is there a way for me to do it without losing the Windows 7 setup/data?
