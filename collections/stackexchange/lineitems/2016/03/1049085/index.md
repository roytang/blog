title: On Windows, can I prevent LibreOffice from prompting for document recovery
  when it launches or I open a file?
---

I basically never want to use the feature. How to? There's another question here that answers how to disable it in Linux via a command-line option in .bashrc, but I don't think that can be done in Windows?

Edit: Additional information:

- I am on Windows 10

- No Recovery.xcu anywhere on my C drive. 

- even if I discard recovery data, then the next time I open the same file there is no recovery prompt. But when I shutdown Windows without shutting down LibreOffice first, then I get the prompt the next time I open the file.
