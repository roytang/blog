With that in mind, I see two choices:\r\n\r\n1. insert a triple that includes the document's URI as the subject or object, then make a request for that document (as @grtjn suggested)\r\n2. make a REST API extension (using either JavaScript or XQuery) that calls cts:search with cts:triple-range-query as part of the query; call that extension from Node", "date": "2016-12-05 15:31:47", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/a71246f507b4964e3006f68f9ba38783?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40968519/marklogic-node-js-api-how-to-get-the-document-where-an-embedded-triple-lives", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40968519/marklogic-node-js-api-how-to-get-the-document-where-an-embedded-triple-lives", "source": "stackexchange"}
