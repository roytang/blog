We have a [Support for TDE](https://github.com/marklogic-community/roxy/issues/848) ticket to track the need for this. Please raise a flag there to push its priority.\r\n\r\nYou can get there fairly easily with some deploy/app_specific.rb tweaking though.

Or write code that uploads each file, and inserts them with the appropriate tde functions.\r\n\r\nHTH!", "date": "2017-11-06 08:12:33", "photo": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6dJv.png?s=128&g=1", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47129470/marklogic-roxy-and-template-driven-extraction", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47129470/marklogic-roxy-and-template-driven-extraction", "source": "stackexchange"}
