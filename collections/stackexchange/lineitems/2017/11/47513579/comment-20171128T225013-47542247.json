Then although the template doesn't generate \"sibling-of\" directly, the triples are still tied to the ingested document in the same way as they would be, by virtue of the template generating the \"is-parent-of\" triples.", "date": "2017-11-28 22:50:13", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/fbeda50c76490faa47d6c6a9a696746e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47513579/marklogic-template-driven-extraction-and-triples-forming-triples-between-array", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47513579/marklogic-template-driven-extraction-and-triples-forming-triples-between-array", "source": "stackexchange"}
