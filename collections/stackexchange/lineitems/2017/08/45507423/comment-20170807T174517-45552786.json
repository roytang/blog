The parse function constructs a cts query based on the parameters. To support something like \"age GT 10\", you'd want to build something like\r\n\r\n    cts:element-range-query(\r\n      xs:QName(\"date-of-birth\"), \"<=\", \r\n      fn:current-date() - xs:yearMonthDuration(\"P10Y\")\r\n    )\r\n\r\nYou'll need a date range index on `date-of-birth`. \r\n\r\nOnce you've build that custom constraint, you can call it from the MarkLogic Node.js Client API. See [Using a Custom Constraint Parser](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/node-dev/search#id_68808). There's an [example](http://docs.marklogic.com/guide/node-dev/search#id_77681) in the Node Developer's Guide, too.
