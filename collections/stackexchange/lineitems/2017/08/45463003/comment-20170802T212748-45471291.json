If you pass a payload in which the <code>range-element-indexes</code> property is empty, I think it removes any existing ones. \r\n\r\nTake a look at the following:\r\n\r\nhttp://docs.marklogic.com/REST/PUT/manage/v2/databases/[id-or-name]/properties\r\n\r\nYou'd want to use a payload similar to the following for XML:\r\n\r\n    <database-properties xmlns=\"http://marklogic.com/manage\">\r\n    <range-element-indexes/>\r\n    </database-properties>\r\n\r\nOr like this for JSON:\r\n\r\n    { \"range-element-index\": [] }\r\n\r\nBe careful, though: It's a sharp tool. You'll also delete pre-defined indexes like the ones for DLS. I think that's also true of Tamas' solution, but did not confirm.", "date": "2017-08-02 21:27:48", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/611f6dc6da52e72a98a9cf261e8b026e?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45463003/marklogic-delete-all-element-range-indexes-on-a-database", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45463003/marklogic-delete-all-element-range-indexes-on-a-database", "source": "stackexchange"}
