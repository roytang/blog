title: Moving connector edges in jsplumb
---

I'm using the [demo of jsPlumb here:][1]

In this demo, there's no way to move an existing connection to a different target node. Any idea how to do it?

Some of the other examples have movable connections, but they also use specific endpoints on the nodes. I like this particular example where I can drag the connection endpoint to any point of the target node.
