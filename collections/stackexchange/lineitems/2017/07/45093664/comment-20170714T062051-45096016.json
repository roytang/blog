You can use semantics for that where you use `owl:sameAs` triples, or you could make use of the MarkLogic [thsr library](http://docs.marklogic.com/thsr).\r\n- Normalize your data at ingest with a reverse lookup in the thesaurus or ontology of above. You could potentially tag found matches, and add the normalized name as an attribute for searches on the normalized term. You would normalize the search terms in the same manner.\r\n- Use [`spell:double-metaphone`](http://docs.marklogic.com/spell:double-metaphone) on each token in the name at ingest, and also on the search terms to search with those instead of the real name.\r\n\r\nSearch term expansion sounds like most straight-forward in this case, particularly since you are talking about mere spelling differences of terms like 'Company' and 'Incorporated'.\r\n\r\nHTH!", "date": "2017-07-14 06:20:51", "photo": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/A6dJv.png?s=128&g=1", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45093664/marklogic-detecting-similar-duplicate-names", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45093664/marklogic-detecting-similar-duplicate-names", "source": "stackexchange"}
