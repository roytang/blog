(Unfortunately I did it before I saw the answers posted here, all of which I assume will work about as well as this one)\r\n\r\nHere's how I did it:\r\n\r\n    def item_link(self, item):\r\n        # adding http:// means the internal get_feed won't modify it\r\n        return \"http://\"+item.magnet_link\r\n\r\n    def get_feed(self, obj, request):\r\n        # hacky way to bypass the domain handling\r\n        feed = super().get_feed(obj, request)\r\n        for item in feed.items:\r\n            # strip that http:// we added above\r\n            item['link'] = item['link'][7:]\r\n        return feed\r\n\r\nFor future readers, this was as of Django 2.0.1. Hopefully in a future patch they allow support for protocols like magnet.", "date": "2018-02-03 14:52:37", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7874a4682d547b17543476272725198?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48557175/django-syndication-framework-prevent-appending-site-id-to-the-links", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48557175/django-syndication-framework-prevent-appending-site-id-to-the-links", "source": "stackexchange"}
