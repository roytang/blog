title: 'Django syndication framework: prevent appending SITE_ID to the links'
---

According to the documentation here: https://djangobook.com/syndication-feed-framework/

> If link doesnâ€™t return the domain, the syndication framework will
> insert the domain of the current site, according to your SITE_ID
> setting

However, I'm trying to generate a feed of magnet: links. The framework doesn't recognize this and attempts to append the SITE_ID, such that the links end up like this (on localhost):

    <link>http://localhost:8000magnet:?xt=...</link>

Is there a way to bypass this?
