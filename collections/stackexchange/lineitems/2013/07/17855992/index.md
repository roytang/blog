title: Differences between IE 8 and IE 8 Compatibility View Browser Modes?
---

Since I found out that we can't force IE 8 Browser Mode for intranet sites if "Display intranet sites in Compatibility View" mode is ticked (regardless of X-UA-COMPATIBLE headers or metatags), I'm trying to assess the impact of just running with IE 8 Compatibility View Browser Mode. (With IE 8 Standards as the Document Mode)

Can anyone advice or is there any resource somewhere that can tell me what differences there are between these 2 browser modes?
