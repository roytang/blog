title: CKEditor inline editing - adding hint text
---

I'm using the inline editing feature of CKEditor, but I want to add some hint text to the initial state of the control, i.e. something like "Click here to edit...", but I would like that hint text to be removed automatically when the user clicks the control to start typing. Is this feasible, or is there any alternative?

Thanks!
