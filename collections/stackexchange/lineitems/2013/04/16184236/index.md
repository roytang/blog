title: CKEditor 4 - how to add font family and font size controls to the toolbar
---

I have a config.toolbarGroups setting in config.js but I don't know what name to use for the groups to add font family/font size controls. (It seems the documentation is lacking in this regard). I've found some suggestion that I should use CKBuilder to create a package that already includes it, but I can't redeploy the entire ckeditor just to add a couple of buttons.

Edit: My CKEditor is version 4

Any advise? 

Thanks!
