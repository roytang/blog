Hooray!\r\n", "date": "2009-10-11 12:34:21", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c7874a4682d547b17543476272725198?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1491562/loading-and-resizing-images-dynamically", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1491562/loading-and-resizing-images-dynamically", "source": "stackexchange"}
