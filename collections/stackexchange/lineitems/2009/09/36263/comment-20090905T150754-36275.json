On some battery backups, there is a button indicating that if the 'Main Power' is off it turns off the rest of the power for the battery backup.  If that happens, then it will turn off the power to the wifi as well.\r\n\r\nJust a thought...  I had this happen to me once and it drove me nuts until I actually looked at the battery backup.\r\n\r\n\r\n-JFV", "date": "2009-09-05 15:07:54", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2b369144b287442efb41fcda2cc8e299?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/36263/desktop-rebooting-restarts-wireless-connection", "mention_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/36263/desktop-rebooting-restarts-wireless-connection", "source": "stackexchange"}
