title: Desktop rebooting restarts wireless connection
---

Here's our home setup: we have a wireless router, connected are 2 desktop PCs (let's call them A and B), plus we also have a laptop that connects to the router via wi-fi. Desktops A and B are connected via LAN wires.

Given that, the problem is that every time desktop A starts up or shuts down (it seems to be simply on power up or power down, the OS it's booting into doesn't matter), the wireless connection is reset, i.e. the laptop literally loses the connection and has to reconnect. No such problem happens when restarting desktop B. It's a bit of a pain when I'm playing online games or something over the laptop and desktop A reboots. 

I'm not sure what to check for here...would it be a problem with the router, with the way the network is set up, or something else?
