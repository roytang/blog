title: Displaying Chinese text in an Applet
---

We have an Applet that can possibly display Chinese text. We are specifying a font for it (Arial), it works fine under both Windows and Mac OSX.

But in Firefox on Linux the Chinese characters are rendered as squares. Is there a way to work around this? Note that we can't assume the existence of a particular font file on the client.
