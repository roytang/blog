The best solution depends heavily on the details of your app and what your customers are willing to tolerate.\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to me that the industry standard in this area is trust your customer, and rely on contract terms to prevent illegal proliferation.  In other words, issue a single license key.  Then, if someone calls for support or asks for an upgrade, ask for the same license key.  If a customer who isn't supposed to have the key reports that they do, then the original customer gets some sort of penalty or bill for letting the software out of their control; the terms would be spelled out in your contract with them.  Many companies seem to end up just collecting data along those lines, but never actually go as far as collecting penalties.\r\n\r\nAnother approach is that your software could ping a central server on the Internet (if it's available), and report its license key.  The server then authorizes the application to run.  If the key leaks from the customer, then the old one gets invalidated, and the customer is required to update all of their existing clients.", "date": "2009-11-16 09:08:18", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/5ebeec76e20738d0a17cd724d64b1e0f?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740843/how-to-enforce-a-site-wide-license", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1740843/how-to-enforce-a-site-wide-license", "source": "stackexchange"}
