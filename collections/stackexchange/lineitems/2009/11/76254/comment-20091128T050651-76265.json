If it is clicking when you first power it on then you can put the disk in the [freezer][1].\r\n\r\n - When you hear a drive clicking it means:\r\n   - When a drive first starts it needs to get the servo information which is stored on the drive\r\n   - If it is unable to lock onto this servoing information it pulls the head back in and performs the \"recalibrate operation\" then puts the head back out and this is the click you can hear \r\n - This is something that is normally fatal for the drive and Spinrite can not fix it you would need to send it somewhere to be opened and fixed, or you could try putting it in the fridge / freezer\r\n\r\nBefore you place it in the freezer put it in an anti-static bag. Then when you take it out wrap it in a towel in the bag b/c of when it heats up it might drip. >.<\r\n\r\nAlso you can try [Spin Rite][2] from [Steve Gibson][3].\r\n\r\nBroken hard drives are always tricky :( ... and I guess I should mention you should always back up.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/Security_Now_210\r\n  [2]: http://www.grc.com/sr/spinrite.htm\r\n  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Gibson_%28computer_programmer%29", "date": "2009-11-28 05:06:51", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/95979f454231091ee99db7dddb064800?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/76254/wd-external-hd-no-longer-working", "mention_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/76254/wd-external-hd-no-longer-working", "source": "stackexchange"}
