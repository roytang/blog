title: WD External HD no longer working
---

I have a 320GB western digital external HDD that was working fine a couple of days ago. 

I plugged it into my Windows XP machine at work, and it detects the USB device (it is listed in the Safely Remove Hardware dialog), but it doesn't detect the disk, not even under Disk Management in Control Panel. I've successfully used this ext HD on this machine before, so I suspect it is busted. I tried it on a couple of other machines none of them could detect the disk.

The only possible reason I could think of is that the bag I was carrying it in fell to the floor off a table a couple of days ago, it might have been damaged then. 

Obviously I would like to have the device working again, but failing that I would like to be able tor recover all the data on the disk. 

What are my options? 

Edit: In case it's relevant, the product page for the ext HD is [here][1].
