We refer to the value matched for subexpression\r\n   <n> as $<n>.  For example, matching the above expression to\r\n\r\n      http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/uri/#Related\r\n\r\n   results in the following subexpression matches:\r\n\r\n      $1 = http:\r\n      $2 = http\r\n      $3 = //www.ics.uci.edu\r\n      $4 = www.ics.uci.edu\r\n      $5 = /pub/ietf/uri/\r\n      $6 = <undefined>\r\n      $7 = <undefined>\r\n      $8 = #Related\r\n      $9 = Related\r\n\r\n   where `<undefined>` indicates that the component is not present, as is\r\n   the case for the query component in the above example.  Therefore, we\r\n   can determine the value of the five components as\r\n\r\n      scheme    = $2\r\n      authority = $4\r\n      path      = $5\r\n      query     = $7\r\n      fragment  = $9", "date": "2009-01-14 05:19:28", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/8a662b85e473c0c03c90a3a0ca42dff8?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/441755/regular-expression-to-remove-hostname-and-port-from-url", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/441755/regular-expression-to-remove-hostname-and-port-from-url", "source": "stackexchange"}
