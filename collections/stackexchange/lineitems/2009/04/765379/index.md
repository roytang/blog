title: wxAuiNotebook - preventing certain tabs from closing
---

I'm experimenting with wx.aui.AuiNotebook; is there a way I can prevent particular tabs from being closed? i.e. I have an app that allows the user to create multiple tabs in an AuiNotebook, but the first 2 tabs are system managed and I don't want them to be closed.

Also, in a close event, can I get the window object attached to the tab being closed? (to extract data from it)
