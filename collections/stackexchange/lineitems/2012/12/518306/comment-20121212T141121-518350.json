Does the graphics card have sufficient ventilation? Is there dust in the fan? Do you have any other fans blowing air in to your PC case?\r\n 2. Have you overclocked the graphics card? If so, undo that overclock straight away. If you've overclocked the graphics card excessively in the past before this started happening, you may have damaged the graphics card.\r\n 3. Does this only happen on this computer? Have you tried this graphics card in another computer?\r\n 4. Is your power supply able to supply enough power to your graphics card? The specifications for this should be available online and your power supply's rating should be printed on the side.\r\n\r\nRemoving and reinserting the graphics card may help if it has come loose. It is unlikely that this is a driver problem if you are seeing artefacts on your screen.", "date": "2012-12-12 14:11:21", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/e0919d5c281d7ba68e69916a1000b6bf?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/518306/video-card-displays-graphic-artefacts", "mention_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/518306/video-card-displays-graphic-artefacts", "source": "stackexchange"}
