title: Comparison of Java web framework usage, especially in enterprise projects
---

I'm trying to get a sense of what are the most commonly-used Java web frameworks, with a focus on large, enterprisey projects. I'm interested in which one is most favored by companies/enterprises (which may not be the same as the one most favored by developers or the open source community I guess). I'd also like to be able to cite specific projects used by each framework, preferably big-ticket or well-known ones.

Anyone have any idea about this stuff or can point me in the right direction?

Thanks!
