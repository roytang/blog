Filtering alone is done at a client level, but lazy-loading is done at a server level.\r\n\r\n[Here][1] you can find some examples.\r\n\r\nBoth are implemented with Ajax features by PrimeFaces: on typing each character, the filters are applied and the results updated.\r\n\r\nWith PrimeFaces' lazy-loading you have also the possibility to handle by yourself the filters: on typing a character in a filter, your implementation of the filter is invoked: with a little of Criteria Builder queries you can write the WHERE conditions in a type-safe and OO way, by building an array of `Predicates`: this implies that you don't need to write a single line of sql code.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/ui/datatableHome.jsf", "date": "2012-01-05 18:47:57", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/362984933cf3f6457238125e68419125?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG&f=1", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8738408/search-filter-using-a-beans-field-values", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8738408/search-filter-using-a-beans-field-values", "source": "stackexchange"}
