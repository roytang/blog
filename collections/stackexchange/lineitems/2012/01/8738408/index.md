title: Search filter using a bean's field values
---

Given a JSF/EJB stack, how do I filter the contents of a dataTable listing automatically using the values of a field in a pojo/entity bean?

i.e. I have an entity bean Employee with name field having a value of "John" I would like to use this bean to filter the data table to show only records with name John, and not having to construct the where clause manually?
