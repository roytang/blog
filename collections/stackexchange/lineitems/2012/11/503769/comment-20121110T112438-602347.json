Had a DLink Router (no WLAN) and it was SEEMINGLY very sensitive to slight voltage drops on the 230V End (maybe less input V thus drawing more A than it can take!?). I did not take any measurements or such, so please take all of this with a big grain of salt. When i switched on big loads like a washing machine, the connection dropped. The symptom has vanished since i got a new router. And yes, there might be more complex electrical issues involved here, not my cup of tea. :-) Compared to that old DLink my new FritzBox rocks btw.", "date": "2012-11-10 11:24:38", "photo": "https://i.stack.imgur.com/UAFfy.png?s=128&g=1", "source_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/503769/my-home-router-randomly-disconnects-me-and-im-unable-to-reconnect-to-it", "mention_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/503769/my-home-router-randomly-disconnects-me-and-im-unable-to-reconnect-to-it", "source": "stackexchange"}
