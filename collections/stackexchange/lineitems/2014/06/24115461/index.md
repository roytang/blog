title: Java windows app - is it possible to detect if the current device has touchscreen
  capability?
---

As it says in the title, I have a Java app that runs on Windows (using SWT). How can the java app detect if the machine has touch screen capability?

The purpose is to present different UI elements if touch screen is available.
