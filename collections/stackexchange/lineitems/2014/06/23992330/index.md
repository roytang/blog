title: How to convert an offset from GMT to the local timezone?
---

I have two inputs:

- a date value
- an integer (+8 or -3 or such) that represents the offset from GMT

Using Java, how can I convert the given date value into the corresponding date/time in the local timezone? There doesn't seem to be any timezone offset function in the Date class.

Thanks!
