title: How can I find out which slow script is giving IE problems?
---

IE8 is giving me the slow-running script message on load of a page:

> Stop running this script? A script on this page is causing your web
> browser to run slowly. If it continues to run, your computer might
> become unresponsive.

However, the webapp I'm debugging is fairly old and has a whole lot of scripts. Is there an easy way for me to find out which of those scripts is causing the problem?
