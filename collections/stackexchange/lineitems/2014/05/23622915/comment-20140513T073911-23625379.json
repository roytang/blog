Java 7 Update 10 added official support. See [Java on Windows 8 FAQ](https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/win8_faq.xml).\r\n\r\nBy default, Java is not installed on the Surface Pro. There is no `java.exe` or `javac.exe` when attempting to run from the command line. You have to go to Oracle and fetch it.\r\n\r\nI was able to install the JRE on my Surface Pro. The package was installed in `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Java\\jre7\\bin`. After the install, `java.exe -version` worked from the command line (after fixing `PATH`). The install also included an IE plugin, and it appears to have worked with IE 10 from the tablet. I was also able to install the x64 JRE. I did not try to install the JDK.\r\n\r\nThere may be something offered on the Windows App Store, too.
