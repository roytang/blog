title: Developing Java desktop applications on Microsoft Surface Pro/Pro 2
---

I have a working Java SWING-based desktop application, and I'm being asked if it can be run on the Microsoft Surface Pro or Pro 2. As I understand it, these are using stock Windows 8/8.1 and will be able to run any Windows app normally, is this correct?

Are there any caveats or special considerations when running my app on these devices?

Edit: If it matters, the JRE would be distributed together with the application, so installing Java isnt an issue.
