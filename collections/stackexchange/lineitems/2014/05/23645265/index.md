title: Adding multitouch support to an AWT application
---

I have an existing AWT Java desktop application. Is there a library or something I can use to have it respond to multitouch gestures (in Windows 7/8)? I see there's frameworks like MT4J or JavaFX that have multitouch support, but it seems these are separate UI frameworks that I can't use with my existing app?
