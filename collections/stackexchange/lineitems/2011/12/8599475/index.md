title: Java API for OpenText eDocs/Hummingbird
---

Does anyone know if there is a java API provided for OpenText eDocs (formerly Hummingbird DM)? 

Our experience in using it in our webapp is limited to client-side access using ActiveX, we'd like to know if there's a way to access the API on the server side using Java

Thanks!
