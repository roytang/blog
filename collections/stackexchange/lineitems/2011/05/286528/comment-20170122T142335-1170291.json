I found if I unplugged the wired network from the router then all the wireless devices connected fine.  If I plugged in the wired network then some wireless devices worked and other didn't.  I diagnosed it by unplugging everything on the lan and re-connecting them one at a time, until I found that I had put the network in the wrong socket on my FON wireless access point.  I plugged it in where it said \"internet\" not where it said \"computer\", and all was well.", "date": "2017-01-22 14:23:35", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/794219ff39c663ea1b7cc6df228e67ff?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/286528/some-wireless-devices-occasionally-cant-connect-to-the-internet-via-our-wireles", "mention_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/286528/some-wireless-devices-occasionally-cant-connect-to-the-internet-via-our-wireles", "source": "stackexchange"}
