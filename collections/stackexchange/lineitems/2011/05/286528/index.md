title: Some wireless devices occasionally can't connect to the internet via our wireless
  router
---

We have a wifi router set up at home connected to our DSL router. And a lot of computers using it...there's a desktop (connected to the router via a wired connection), 6 laptops, an ipad and a few internet-capable cellphones (yeah, there are a lot of us at home)

Sometimes our internet will "act up", meaning some of the wireless devices will register as being connected to the access point but unable to access any sites. In such a case the other devices seem to be access the internet just fine.

I'm wondering if there's some sort of limit or anything to the number of wireless devices we should be allowing to access the router that causes this problem? What things do I need to check?
