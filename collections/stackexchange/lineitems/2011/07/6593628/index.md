title: Oracle BPM and Oracle ADF
---

We're developing a BPM application to be run on Weblogic, and all the tutorials point to using Oracle ADF for rendering the task forms. My question is: is it feasible to use some other framework other than Oracle ADF for this? We're not really that familiar with either Oracle BPM or Oracle ADF, but we can't avoid using Oracle BPM (contract reqt), so we would like to see if we can avoid Oracle ADF instead to minimize the learning effort.
