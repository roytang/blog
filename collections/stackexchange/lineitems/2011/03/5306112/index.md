title: Local VCS for one person use
---

Not really a programming question per se, so pls advice if I should move it to some other stackexchange...

Is there a recommended Version Control solution running on a local (Windows XP/Vista/7) machine for the use of a single person only? I may not have internet access on the box so online repos like Github or Mercurial are out of the question.

Thanks!
