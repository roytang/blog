There is no \"central server\" for a Hg repository, so you can just create one in your project folder, and commit as and when you like. It also integrates very well into Windows Explorer and (if you use it) Visual Studio using TortoiseHg and VisualHg respectively.\r\n\r\nYou can even implement push/pull functionality in your repositories locally, by storing your repository in a different folder.\r\n\r\n**Edit** - I have used Mercurial locally, and I've also used it by storing my central repositories on an external hard drive. It works identically over a network and between folders (or hard drives) on your local PC.", "date": "2011-03-15 00:15:58", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/c1e5bf4421007b7cfe4dba5ecb24f777?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5306112/local-vcs-for-one-person-use", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5306112/local-vcs-for-one-person-use", "source": "stackexchange"}
