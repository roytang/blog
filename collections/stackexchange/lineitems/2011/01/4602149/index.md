title: Opening PowerBuilder 6.5 source files in PowerBuilder 11
---

I have some legacy powerbuilder programs I need to take a look at (view the source, layouts, etc), they are from PowerBuilder 6.5. All I have available is PowerBuilder 11 (demo/eval version), and it seems to be unable to open the PBL files (selecting them in the file open dialog does nothing).

I guess that it is because the version is very old. ANyone have any idea how I can view those old source files?

Thanks!
