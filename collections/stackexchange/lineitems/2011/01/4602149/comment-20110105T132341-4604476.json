Remember there is [no easy backward migration][1], so be careful with the code. \r\n\r\nA non-destructive alternative is PBL Peeper ([description][2] and [current version pre-release download][3]). With it you get to view the code for any version, in PBLs or exports, without a need for a PowerBuilder license for the specific version. You get more powerful searching and reporting, but you lose the visual representation of the instantiated objects. However, IMHO, as biased as it may be, it lets you see where scripts are and aren't easier and quicker than the IDE. Plus it's got a bunch of other developer tools like a SQL formatter. And, it's hard to argue with free.\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\n\r\nTerry\r\n\r\n\r\n  [1]: http://www.techno-kitten.com/PowerBuilder_Help/PowerBuilder_Migration/Backward_PowerBuilder_Migratio/backward_powerbuilder_migratio.html\r\n  [2]: http://www.techno-kitten.com/PBL_Peeper/pbl_peeper.html\r\n  [3]: http://www.techno-kitten.com/PreRelease411/setup.exe", "date": "2011-01-05 13:23:41", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/529adbfc02706c8e56694a5e0678b8b0?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4602149/opening-powerbuilder-6-5-source-files-in-powerbuilder-11", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4602149/opening-powerbuilder-6-5-source-files-in-powerbuilder-11", "source": "stackexchange"}
