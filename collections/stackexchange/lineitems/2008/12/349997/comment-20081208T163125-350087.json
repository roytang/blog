However, I'm not clear on what the replacement parameter of \r\n\r\n    \"$1<p>\" \r\n\r\nwould be doing, since there's no grouping to map to $1. It would seem like as given, this is just replacing a paragraph tag with an empty string followed by a paragraph tag, and in effect doing nothing.\r\n\r\nAnyone with more in-depth knowledge of PHP quirks have a better analysis?", "date": "2008-12-08 16:31:25", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/9266c30ba6c2e2aa4f9ab2dfffded965?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/349997/what-does-this-regular-expression-do", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/349997/what-does-this-regular-expression-do", "source": "stackexchange"}
