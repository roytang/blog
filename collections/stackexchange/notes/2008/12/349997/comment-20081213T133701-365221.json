The choice to delimit the regex with the vertical bar instead of forward slashes is very unfortunate.  It doesn't change the code, but it makes it harder for humans to read.  (It also makes it impossible to use the alternation operator in the regex.)\r\n\r\n$1 is not a valid variable name in PHP, so $1 is never interpolated in double-quoted strings.  The $1 gets passed to preg_replace unchanged.  preg_replace parses the replacement string, and replaces $1 with the contents of the first capturing group.  If there is no capturing group, $1 is replaced with nothing.\r\n\r\nThus, this code does the same as:\r\n\r\n    $pee = preg_replace( '/<p>/', \"<p>\", $pee );\r\n\r\nIt's not correct that this does nothing.  The search-and-replace will run, slowing down your software, and eating up memory for temporary copies of $pee.", "date": "2008-12-13 13:37:01", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6be380ce9b9b5acad2ff8829befa4df1?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/349997/what-does-this-regular-expression-do", "mention_url": "https://stackoverflow.com/questions/349997/what-does-this-regular-expression-do", "source": "stackexchange"}
