title: Firefox does not render stylesheet immediately?
---

I'm not sure if this a settings problem or an HTML problem, but on a page layout I'm working on, Firefox does not render the stylesheet immediately. Meaning for maybe half a second I can see the unstyled page, then the stylesheet kicks in and it renders as I expect.

All my stylesheets are in external css files loaded in the head tag. I'm not encountering this on Flock (which is a Firefox variant) nor on Google Chrome/IE.

Any idea how to avoid it?
