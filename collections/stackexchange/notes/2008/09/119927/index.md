title: Different framerate for loaded SWF file in Flex?
---

Using The loader class of Adobe Flex, I load an external SWF file. However, the loaded SWF file has a different frameRate than my application.

Is it possible to have both the parent app and the loaded child app playing at different framerates? If so, how?
