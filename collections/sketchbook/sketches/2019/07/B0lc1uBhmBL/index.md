title: 'Wasnt sure whether to post this since thise proportions are out of whack and
  that right shoulder might be dislocated, but maybe I can use it as a ''before''
  picture for when I actually get good at this. My linework is a lot steadier when
  using a physical pen and paper (but still shaky) as compared to the apple pencil
  on ipad. I guess the friction of pen on paper matters. '
