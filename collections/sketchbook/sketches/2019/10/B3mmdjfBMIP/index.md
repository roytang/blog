#inktober2019 day 14 overgrown #inktober #sketchdaily lol so i found these colored markers and thought i could use them to show like a jungle-y area overgrown with vines but these lines are way thicker than i expected so this was way better in my head. Also, looking ahead at the prompt list some of the upcoming ones seem very challenging to integrate into the ongoing so idk i might have to cut off the series abruptly if i cant think of anything, weâ€™ll see
