  "text": "Calma. \n It was offered in exchange for agreeing to bilateral talks.  Wala nman \ntayo napapala sa multilateral talks (ASEAN couldnt agree before on \nSpratlys, so why expect a multilateral talk on 9dash line would be \nproductive).  Hindi pa nagsisimula negotiation may pwede na tayo\n pakinbangan, and of course its a loan hindi naman pinamimigay ang \nganyan kalaki na pera.  China is aware that he'll be around for \nonly 6 yrs so they have to be gracious and generous to convince the rest\n of the country of the benefits.  After his term, those who wish to \nrenew ties with the Philippines will also be gracious and generous.  And\n China may also try to keep the relationship unlike US handling, so in 6\n yrs time they may continue to do the same.  Win-win so far for that \naspect.  Time will tell for the other aspects.",
