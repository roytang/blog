  "text": "One\n would think that given the daily absurdities happening in local \npolitics there would be a lot of source material, but actually many of \nthe problems are difficult to compress into a few panels with little \nspace for text. Outside of that, we are left with the low-hanging fruit \nof pointing out simple hypocrysies, but even then the stories are \nlargely all the same (mostly \"You say X but you do Y\") with only slight \nvariations in the language and the actors and the circumstances, so I'm \nnot sure I would be able to keep up such a thing on a regular basis",
