Genghis Khan. #procreate

More Procreate. Having colors is nice, but it takes up way more time than a pencil sketch does, which is way more time than I want to spend on a sketchdaily, so I didn't bother finishing and cleaning up this. I probably won't do this procreate thing too often

Edit: Actually, if there's anyone else here who uses the Procreate app on iPad, I'd appreciate some advice: Is there a way in the app to get the exact color I used at another part of the image? It would speed things up a bit
