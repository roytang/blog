# hugo-theme-exhale

This is a theme for https://gohugo.io/

Some features (incomplete):

- css grid based layout
- search box using DuckDuckGo
- microformats
- configurable base color
- custom shortcodes (Spoiler tags and MTG decklists)

It's very much a work in progress, and is currently in use on [my blog](https://roytang.net). In the future, this readme will be better.

It is built from scratch, though I copied a lot of code fragments from various places. 

Feel free to use it, if you like. But again, WIP.
